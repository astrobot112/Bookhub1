&#160;<br/>
ONE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;GO &#160;CRUISING &#160;WITH&#160;<br/>
EXPLOSIVES&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>The end of the world started when a pegasus landed on the hood of my&#160;car.&#160;<br/>
Up until then, I was having a great afternoon. Technically I wasn't&#160;supposed to be driving&#160;<br/>
because I wouldn't turn sixteen for another week, but my&#160;mom and my&#160;stepdad, Paul, took my&#160;<br/>friend Rachel and me&#160;to&#160;this private stretch of&#160;beach on the South Shore,&#160;and Paul let us borrow&#160;<br/>his Prius for a short spin.&#160;<br/>
Now, I know you're thinking,&#160;<i>Wow, that was really irresponsible&#160;of him, blah, blah, blah,&#160;</i>but Paul&#160;<br/>
knows me pretty&#160;well. He's seen&#160;me slice up demons&#160;and leap out of exploding school buildings, so he&#160;<br/>probably figured taking a car a few hundred yards wasn't&#160;exactly&#160;the most dangerous thing I'd ever done.&#160;<br/>
Anyway, Rachel and I were driving&#160;along. It&#160;was a&#160;hot August&#160;day. Rachel's red hair was pulled back&#160;<br/>
in a ponytail&#160;and she wore&#160;a white blouse over her swimsuit. I'd never seen her&#160;in anything&#160;but ratty&#160;T-<br/>shirts and paint-splattered jeans before,&#160;and she looked like a million golden&#160;drachmas.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, pull&#160;up right there!&#34; she told me.&#160;<br/>
We parked on a ridge&#160;overlooking the&#160;Atlantic.&#160;The sea is always&#160;one of&#160;my favorite places, but&#160;<br/>
today&#160;it&#160;was especially&#160;nice—glittery&#160;green and smooth as glass,&#160;as though my&#160;dad was keeping it calm&#160;<br/>just for us.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;dad, by&#160;the way,&#160;is Poseidon. He can do stuff&#160;like&#160;that.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So.&#34; Rachel smiled at&#160;me. &#34;About that invitation.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh . . . right.&#34; I tried to sound excited. I&#160;mean,&#160;she'd asked&#160;me&#160;to&#160;her family's&#160;vacation house on St.&#160;<br/>
Thomas for three days. I didn't get a lot of offers like that. My&#160;family's&#160;idea&#160;of a fancy&#160;vacation was&#160;a&#160;<br/>weekend in a rundown cabin on Long Island with some&#160;movie rentals and a couple of frozen pizzas, and&#160;<br/>here Rachel's folks were willing to&#160;let me&#160;tag along to&#160;the Caribbean.&#160;<br/>
Besides,&#160;I seriously&#160;needed a vacation. This summer had been the hardest&#160;of&#160;my&#160;life. The&#160;idea of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2></a>taking a break even for a few days&#160;was really&#160;tempting.&#160;<br/>
Still, something big was supposed to&#160;go down any&#160;day now.&#160;I&#160;was &#34;on call&#34; for a mission. Even&#160;<br/>
worse,&#160;next week was my&#160;birthday.&#160;There was&#160;this&#160;prophecy&#160;that&#160;said when I&#160;turned sixteen, bad things&#160;<br/>would happen.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; she said, &#34;I know the timing is bad. But it's&#160;<i>always&#160;</i>bad for you, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She had a point.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I really&#160;want&#160;to go,&#34; I promised. &#34;It's just—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The war.”&#160;<br/>
I nodded. I didn't like talking about it, but Rachel knew. Unlike&#160;most&#160;mortals, she could see&#160;through&#160;<br/>
the Mist—the&#160;magic veil&#160;that distorts human vision. She'd seen&#160;monsters. She'd&#160;met&#160;some&#160;of the other&#160;<br/>demigods who were fighting the Titans&#160;and their allies. She'd even been there last summer when the&#160;<br/>chopped-up&#160;Lord Kronos&#160;rose out of his coffin in a&#160;terrible new form, and&#160;she'd&#160;earned&#160;my&#160;permanent&#160;<br/>respect by&#160;nailing him&#160;in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush.&#160;<br/>
She put her hand on my&#160;arm.&#160;&#34;Just think about it, okay? We don't leave for a couple of days.&#160;My&#160;dad&#160;.&#160;<br/>
. .&#34; Her voice faltered.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is he giving&#160;you a hard time?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
Rachel shook her head in disgust. &#34;He's trying to&#160;be&#160;<i>nice&#160;</i>to me, which is almost worse. He wants me&#160;<br/>
to go to Clarion Ladies Academy&#160;m&#160;the&#160;fall.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The school&#160;where your mom&#160;went?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's a stupid&#160;finishing&#160;school for&#160;society girls, all&#160;the way&#160;in&#160;New Hampshire. Can&#160;you see&#160;me&#160;in&#160;<br/>
finishing school?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I admitted the idea sounded pretty&#160;dumb. Rachel&#160;was&#160;into urban art projects and feeding the homeless&#160;<br/>
and going to&#160;protest rallies to &#34;Save the Endangered&#160;Yellow-bellied Sapsucker&#34; and stuff&#160;like that. I'd&#160;<br/>never even seen her wear a dress. It was&#160;hard&#160;to imagine her learning to be a socialite.&#160;<br/>
She sighed. &#34;He thinks if he&#160;does a bunch of nice stuff&#160;for me, I'll feel guilty&#160;and&#160;give in.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Which is why he agreed to let me&#160;come with you&#160;guys&#160;on vacation?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes . . . but&#160;Percy,&#160;you'd be doing me&#160;a huge favor. It would be&#160;<i>so&#160;</i>much better if you were&#160;with us.&#160;<br/>
Besides, there's something I want&#160;to talk—&#34; She stopped abruptly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Something&#160;you want to talk about?&#34;&#160;I asked. &#34;You&#160;mean . . .&#160;so serious we'd&#160;have to go to St.&#160;<br/>
Thomas to talk about it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She pursed her lips. &#34;Look, just forget&#160;it for now.&#160;Let's pretend we're&#160;a couple of normal people.&#160;<br/>
We're out for&#160;a drive, and&#160;we're watching the ocean, and it's nice to be together.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I could tell something was bothering her, but she put on a brave smile. The sunlight&#160;made her hair&#160;<br/>
look like fire.&#160;<br/>
We'd&#160;spent a lot&#160;of time together this&#160;summer. I&#160;hadn't exactly&#160;planned it&#160;that way,&#160;but&#160;the more&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3></a>serious things&#160;got&#160;at camp, the more I found myself needing to&#160;call up Rachel and get away, just for some&#160;<br/>breathing room.&#160;I needed to&#160;remind&#160;myself that the&#160;mortal world was still out there, away&#160;from all the&#160;<br/>monsters using me&#160;as their personal&#160;punching&#160;bag.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Okay,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Just a normal afternoon&#160;and two normal people.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She nodded.&#160;&#34;And so . . . hypothetically, if these two&#160;people liked each other,&#160;what would it take to&#160;<br/>
get the stupid&#160;guy&#160;to&#160;kiss the girl, huh?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh . . .&#34; I&#160;felt like one of&#160;Apollo's&#160;sacred&#160;cows—slow, dumb, and bright red.&#160;&#34;Um&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I can't&#160;pretend I hadn't&#160;thought about&#160;Rachel. She was so much easier to be around than&#160;.&#160;. .&#160;well, than&#160;<br/>
some&#160;other girls I knew. I&#160;didn't have to&#160;work hard,&#160;or&#160;watch what I said, or rack&#160;my&#160;brain trying to&#160;figure&#160;<br/>out what she&#160;was thinking.&#160;Rachel didn't hide much. She let you&#160;know how she felt.&#160;<br/>
I'm not sure what I would have done&#160;next—but I was so distracted, I didn't notice the huge black form&#160;<br/>
swooping down from&#160;the&#160;sky&#160;until four&#160;hooves landed on the hood of&#160;the Prius with a&#160;<i>WUMP-WUMP-<br/>CRUNCH!</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Hey, boss,&#160;</i>a voice said in my head.&#160;<i>Nice car!</i>&#160;<br/>
Blackjack the&#160;pegasus was&#160;an old friend&#160;of mine, so&#160;I tried not&#160;to&#160;get too annoyed&#160;by the craters he'd&#160;<br/>
just put in&#160;the&#160;hood; but&#160;I didn't think my&#160;stepdad would be real stoked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blackjack,&#34; I sighed. &#34;What are you—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Then I saw who was riding&#160;on his&#160;back,&#160;and I knew my day&#160;was about to&#160;get a lot more&#160;complicated.&#160;<br/>
&#34; 'Sup, Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Charles Beckendorf, senior counselor for the Hephaestus cabin,&#160;would make&#160;most&#160;monsters&#160;cry&#160;for&#160;<br/>
their&#160;mommies. He&#160;was huge, with ripped&#160;muscles from working on the forges&#160;every&#160;summer, two years&#160;<br/>older than me, and one&#160;of the camp's best armorsmiths. He&#160;made&#160;some&#160;seriously ingenious&#160;mechanical&#160;<br/>stuff. A&#160;month before, he'd rigged a Greek firebomb in the bathroom&#160;of a tour bus that was<i>&#160;</i>carrying a&#160;<br/>bunch of monsters across&#160;country. The explosion took&#160;out a whole legion of&#160;Kronos's&#160;evil&#160;meanies as&#160;<br/>soon as the first harpy went&#160;<i>flush.</i>&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf was dressed&#160;for combat.&#160;He wore&#160;a bronze breastplate and war&#160;helm&#160;with black camo&#160;<br/>
pants and a sword strapped to his side.&#160;His&#160;explosives bag was slung over his shoulder.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Time?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
He nodded grimly.&#160;<br/>
A clump formed in&#160;my&#160;throat. I'd known this was&#160;coming.<i>&#160;</i>We'd&#160;been planning&#160;for it for weeks, but I'd&#160;<br/>
half hoped it&#160;would never&#160;happen.&#160;<br/>
Rachel looked up at Beckendorf. &#34;Hi.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, hey.&#160;I'm Beckendorf. You must be&#160;Rachel. Percy's told&#160;me&#160;. . . uh, I mean he&#160;mentioned you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel raised an eyebrow.&#160;&#34;Really? Good.&#34; She&#160;glanced at Blackjack, who was clopping&#160;his&#160;hooves&#160;<br/>
against the hood of the Prius. &#34;So I guess&#160;you&#160;guys&#160;have to go&#160;save the world now.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4></a>&#34;Pretty&#160;much,&#34; Beckendorf agreed.&#160;<br/>
I looked at Rachel helplessly. &#34;Would&#160;you tell my&#160;mom—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll tell her. I'm&#160;sure she's&#160;used to it. And I'll explain to Paul about&#160;the hood.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded&#160;my&#160;thanks. I figured this might be the last time Paul loaned me his car.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good luck.&#34; Rachel kissed me&#160;before I&#160;could even&#160;react. &#34;Now, get going, half-blood. Go kill some&#160;<br/>
monsters for me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;last view of her was sitting in the shotgun seat of the Prius, her arms crossed, watching as&#160;<br/>
Blackjack&#160;circled higher and higher, carrying Beckendorf and me into the sky.&#160;I wondered&#160;what Rachel&#160;<br/>wanted to talk to me&#160;about, and whether I'd live long&#160;enough&#160;to find&#160;out.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So,&#34; Beckendorf said, &#34;I'm&#160;guessing you don't want&#160;me to&#160;mention that little scene to Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, gods,&#34;&#160;I&#160;muttered. &#34;Don't even think about it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf chuckled, and&#160;together we&#160;soared out over the Atlantic.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
It was almost&#160;dark by the&#160;time&#160;we spotted our target. The&#160;<i>Princess&#160;Andromeda&#160;</i>glowed on&#160;the horizon—a&#160;<br/>huge cruise ship lit up&#160;yellow and white. From&#160;a distance, you'd think it was just a party&#160;ship, not the&#160;<br/>headquarters&#160;for the Titan&#160;lord. Then as you got closer, you might notice the giant figurehead—a dark-<br/>haired maiden&#160;in a Greek chiton, wrapped m&#160;chains&#160;with a look&#160;of horror on&#160;her face, as if&#160;she could&#160;<br/>smell the stench of all the&#160;monsters she&#160;was being forced to carry.&#160;<br/>
Seeing the ship again twisted&#160;my&#160;gut into&#160;knots. I'd almost died twice on the&#160;<i>Princess&#160;Andromeda.&#160;</i><br/>
Now it was heading straight for New York.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know what to do?&#34; Beckendorf&#160;yelled over the&#160;wind.&#160;<br/>
I nodded. We'd&#160;done dry&#160;runs at the dockyards in New Jersey,&#160;using&#160;abandoned ships as our targets. I&#160;<br/>
knew how little time&#160;we&#160;would have. But I also knew this was our best chance to end Kronos's&#160;invasion&#160;<br/>before it ever started.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blackjack,&#34; I said, &#34;set us down on the&#160;lowest stern deck.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Gotcha, boss,&#160;</i>he said.&#160;<i>Man, I hate seeing that&#160;boat.</i>&#160;<br/>
Three years ago, Blackjack had been enslaved on the&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda&#160;</i>until&#160;he'd&#160;escaped with a&#160;<br/>
little help from&#160;my&#160;friends and&#160;me. I figured he'd&#160;rather have his&#160;mane braided like My&#160;Little Pony&#160;than&#160;<br/>be back here again.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't wait for us,&#34; I told&#160;him.&#160;<br/>
<i>But, boss</i>—<i>&#160;</i><br/>
&#34;Trust me,&#34; I said. &#34;We'll get out by ourselves.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Blackjack folded his wings&#160;and plummeted toward&#160;the boat like a black comet. The wind whistled in&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>my&#160;ears. I saw&#160;monsters&#160;&#160;patrolling the&#160;upper decks of the ship—<i>dracaenae</i>&#160;snake-women,&#160;hellhounds,&#160;<br/>giants, and the humanoid seal-demons known as telkhines—but we&#160;zipped by&#160;so fast, none of them&#160;raised&#160;<br/>the alarm.&#160;We&#160;shot down the stern of the boat, and Blackjack spread his wings, lightly&#160;coming to a&#160;<br/>landing&#160;on the lowest deck. I climbed off, feeling queasy.&#160;<br/>
<i>Good luck, boss,&#160;</i>Blackjack&#160;said.&#160;<i>Don't&#160;let 'em turn you into horse&#160;meat!</i>&#160;<br/>
With that, my&#160;old friend&#160;flew off into the night.&#160;I took&#160;my&#160;pen out&#160;of&#160;my&#160;pocket and uncapped&#160;it, and&#160;<br/>
Riptide sprang to full size—three feet of&#160;deadly Celestial bronze glowing in&#160;the&#160;dusk.&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf pulled a piece of paper out&#160;of his pocket.&#160;I thought it&#160;was&#160;a&#160;map or something. Then I&#160;<br/>
realized<i>&#160;&#160;</i>it was a photograph. He stared at it in the dim&#160;light—the smiling face of Silena&#160;Beauregard,&#160;<br/>daughter of&#160;Aphrodite. They'd&#160;started going&#160;out last summer, after years of the rest of us&#160;saying, &#34;Duh,&#160;<br/>you guys&#160;like&#160;each other!&#34; Even with all the dangerous&#160;missions, Beckendorf had been happier this&#160;<br/>summer than I'd ever seen him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll&#160;make it back to camp,&#34; I promised.&#160;<br/>
For&#160;<i>a&#160;</i>second&#160;I saw worry&#160;in&#160;his eyes. Then he put&#160;on&#160;his old confident smile.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You bet,&#34; he&#160;said. &#34;Let's&#160;go&#160;blow Kronos back into a&#160;million pieces.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf led the way.&#160;We followed&#160;a narrow&#160;corridor to&#160;the service stairwell, just like we'd practiced,&#160;<br/>but we froze when we heard noises above us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't care&#160;what your nose says!&#34; snarled a half-human, half-dog voice—a telkhine. &#34;The last time&#160;<br/>
you smelled&#160;half-blood, it&#160;turned out to&#160;be a&#160;meat loaf sandwich!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Meat loaf sandwiches are&#160;good!&#34; a second voice snarled.&#160;&#34;But this&#160;is half-blood&#160;scent, I swear. They&#160;<br/>
are on board!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bah, your&#160;<i>brain&#160;</i>isn't on board!&#34;&#160;<br/>
They continued to argue, and Beckendorf pointed&#160;downstairs. We descended as quietly&#160;as we could.&#160;<br/>
Two floors down, the voices of the telkhines started to fade.&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;we came to a&#160;metal&#160;hatch. Beckendorf mouthed the words &#34;engine room.&#34;&#160;<br/>
It was locked, but Beckendorf pulled some chain cutters out of his bag and split the bolt like it was&#160;<br/>
made of butter.&#160;<br/>
Inside, a row of&#160;yellow turbines the size of grain silos churned and hummed. Pressure gauges and&#160;<br/>
computer terminals lined&#160;the opposite wall. A telkhine was hunched over a&#160;console, but&#160;he was so&#160;<br/>involved with&#160;his work,&#160;he didn't notice us. He was about five&#160;feet tall, with slick black seal fur and&#160;<br/>stubby&#160;little feet. He had the head of a Doberman, but&#160;his clawed&#160;hands were almost human. He growled&#160;<br/>and muttered&#160;as he tapped on his keyboard. Maybe he&#160;was&#160;messaging his friends&#160;on uglyface.com.&#160;<br/>
I stepped forward, and he tensed, probably&#160;smelling something was&#160;wrong. He leaped sideways&#160;<br/>
toward a big red alarm button, but I blocked his path. He hissed and lunged at&#160;me, but one slice of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>Riptide, and&#160;he exploded into dust.&#160;<br/>
&#34;One down,&#34; Beckendorf said. &#34;About five thousand&#160;to go.&#34; He&#160;tossed&#160;me&#160;a jar of thick green&#160;<br/>
liquid—Greek fire, one of&#160;the&#160;most&#160;dangerous magical&#160;substances in&#160;the&#160;world. Then&#160;he&#160;threw me another&#160;<br/>essential tool of demigod heroes—duct tape.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Slap that one on the console,&#34; he said.&#160;&#34;I'll get the turbines.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We went to work. The room&#160;was hot and humid,&#160;and&#160;in no time&#160;we&#160;were drenched m&#160;sweat.&#160;<br/>
The boat kept&#160;chugging&#160;along. Being the&#160;son of Poseidon&#160;and all, I&#160;have perfect&#160;bearings at sea. Don't&#160;<br/>
ask&#160;me&#160;how,&#160;but I could&#160;tell we were at&#160;40.19° North,&#160;71.90° West,&#160;making eighteen knots, which meant&#160;<br/>the ship would arrive in New York Harbor by&#160;dawn.&#160;This would be&#160;our only chance to stop it.&#160;<br/>
I had just attached a&#160;second&#160;jar of Greek fire to&#160;the&#160;control panels&#160;when I heard&#160;the pounding of feet&#160;<br/>
on metal&#160;steps—so&#160;many&#160;creatures&#160;coming down the stairwell&#160;I could hear them over the&#160;engines. Not a&#160;<br/>good&#160;sign.&#160;<br/>
I locked eyes with Beckendorf. &#34;How much longer?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Too long.&#34;&#160;He tapped his watch, which was our remote&#160;control detonator.&#160;&#34;I&#160;still have to wire the&#160;<br/>
receiver and&#160;prime the charges. Ten&#160;more&#160;minutes at least.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Judging from the sound of&#160;the footsteps,&#160;we had about&#160;ten seconds.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll distract them,&#34; I said. &#34;Meet you at&#160;the rendezvous point.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Wish me luck.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He looked like he wanted to argue. The&#160;whole idea had been to get in and out&#160;without being&#160;spotted.&#160;<br/>
But we were&#160;going&#160;to have&#160;to improvise.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good luck,&#34;&#160;he said.&#160;<br/>
I charged out&#160;the door.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
A half dozen&#160;telkhines were tromping down the stairs.&#160;I cut through them&#160;with Riptide faster than they&#160;<br/>could&#160;yelp. I&#160;kept climbing—past another telkhine, who was so startled he dropped his Lil'&#160;Demons lunch&#160;<br/>box. I left him alive—partly&#160;because his lunch box was cool, partly&#160;so he could raise the alarm&#160;and&#160;<br/>hopefully get&#160;his friends to&#160;follow me&#160;rather than head&#160;toward the engine room.&#160;<br/>
I burst through a door onto&#160;deck six and&#160;kept running. I'm&#160;sure the carpeted hall had once been very&#160;<br/>
plush, but&#160;over the last three years of&#160;monster occupation the wallpaper, carpet,&#160;and stateroom doors had&#160;<br/>been clawed&#160;up and slimed so it looked like the inside&#160;of a dragon's throat (and&#160;yes,&#160;unfortunately, I speak&#160;<br/>from&#160;experience).&#160;<br/>
Back on my&#160;first visit to the&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda,&#160;</i>my&#160;old enemy&#160;Luke had&#160;kept&#160;some&#160;dazed tourists&#160;<br/>
on board for show, shrouded in Mist so&#160;they&#160;didn't&#160;realize&#160;they&#160;were on a&#160;monster-infested&#160;ship. Now I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a>didn't see any&#160;sign of tourists. I hated to think what&#160;had happened to them, but I kind of doubted they'd&#160;<br/>been allowed to go&#160;home with their bingo winnings.&#160;<br/>
I reached the promenade,&#160;a big shopping mall that&#160;took up the whole&#160;middle of the ship, and I&#160;<br/>
stopped cold.&#160;In the middle of the courtyard stood a fountain. And in&#160;the fountain&#160;squatted a giant crab.&#160;<br/>
I'm&#160;not talking &#34;giant&#34;&#160;like&#160;$7.99 all-you-can-eat Alaskan king crab. I'm&#160;talking&#160;<i>giant</i>&#160;like bigger than&#160;<br/>
the fountain.&#160;The&#160;monster&#160;rose ten feet&#160;out of the water. Its shell&#160;was&#160;mottled blue and green, its pincers&#160;<br/>longer than my&#160;body.&#160;<br/>
If you've ever seen a crab's&#160;mouth, all foamy&#160;and gross with whiskers and snapping bits, you can&#160;<br/>
imagine this one didn't&#160;look&#160;any&#160;better blown up&#160;to billboard size. Its beady&#160;black eyes glared at&#160;me, and I&#160;<br/>could see intelligence in them—and hate. The fact&#160;that&#160;I was the&#160;son of the sea&#160;god was not going to&#160;win&#160;<br/>me any&#160;points with Mr. Crabby.&#160;<br/>
&#34;<i>FFFFffffff,</i>&#34;<i>&#160;</i>it hissed, sea&#160;foam&#160;dripping from&#160;its&#160;mouth.&#160;The smell coming off it was like a garbage&#160;<br/>
can full of fish sticks that had been sitting in the sun all week.&#160;<br/>
Alarms blared. Soon&#160;I was going&#160;to&#160;have&#160;lots of company&#160;and I&#160;had to keep moving.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, crabby.&#34;&#160;I inched around the edge of the courtyard. &#34;I'm&#160;just gonna scoot around&#160;you so—&#34;&#160;<br/>
The crab&#160;moved with amazing speed. It scuttled out of&#160;the fountain and came&#160;straight at&#160;me, pincers&#160;<br/>
snapping.&#160;1 dove into a gift shop,&#160;plowing through a&#160;rack of T-shirts. A crab pincer smashed the glass&#160;<br/>walls to pieces and raked across the room. I dashed&#160;back outside, breathing heavily,&#160;but Mr. Crabby&#160;<br/>turned and followed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;There!&#34; a voice said from&#160;a balcony above me. &#34;Intruder!&#34;&#160;<br/>
If I'd wanted&#160;to create&#160;a&#160;distraction, I'd&#160;succeeded, but this was&#160;not where I&#160;wanted to fight. If I got&#160;<br/>
pinned&#160;down&#160;in the center of the ship, I&#160;was crab chow.&#160;<br/>
The demonic&#160;crustacean lunged at me. I&#160;sliced with Riptide, taking&#160;off the tip&#160;of its claw. It hissed&#160;<br/>
and foamed, but didn't seem&#160;very&#160;hurt.&#160;<br/>
I tried to remember&#160;anything from&#160;the&#160;old stories that&#160;might help with this thing. Annabeth&#160;had told&#160;<br/>
me about a monster crab—something about Hercules&#160;crushing it under his foot? That wasn't&#160;going to&#160;<br/>work here. This crab was slightly&#160;bigger than my&#160;Reeboks.&#160;<br/>
Then a weird thought&#160;occurred to me. Last Christmas, my&#160;mom&#160;and I had&#160;brought Paul Blofis&#160;to our&#160;<br/>
old cabin at&#160;Montauk, where we'd&#160;been going forever. Paul had taken me&#160;crabbing, and when he'd&#160;<br/>brought up&#160;a&#160;net full&#160;of the things, he'd&#160;shown me&#160;how crabs have a chink&#160;in&#160;their armor, right in&#160;the&#160;<br/>middle of their ugly&#160;bellies.&#160;<br/>
The only&#160;problem&#160;was getting to&#160;the ugly belly.&#160;<br/>
I glanced at the fountain,&#160;then at the marble floor, already&#160;slick from&#160;scuttling crab tracks. I held out&#160;<br/>
my&#160;hand, concentrating on the water, and the fountain exploded.&#160;Water&#160;sprayed everywhere, three stories&#160;<br/>high, dousing&#160;the balconies and the elevators and the&#160;windows of the shops. The crab didn't&#160;care. It loved&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>water. It came at&#160;me&#160;sideways, snapping and hissing,&#160;and I ran straight at it, screaming, &#34;AHHHHHHH!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Just before&#160;we collided, I hit the ground&#160;baseball-style and slid on the wet&#160;marble&#160;floor straight under&#160;<br/>
the creature. It was like sliding under a seven-ton armored vehicle. All the crab had&#160;to&#160;do&#160;was sit and&#160;<br/>squash&#160;me, but before it realized what&#160;was going on, I&#160;jabbed Riptide into the chink in its armor, let go of&#160;<br/>the hilt, and pushed myself out the backside.&#160;<br/>
The monster&#160;shuddered and hissed. Its eyes dissolved. Its shell turned bright red&#160;as its insides&#160;<br/>
evaporated. The empty&#160;shell clattered to the floor in a massive heap.&#160;<br/>
I didn't have time to admire&#160;my&#160;handiwork. I ran for&#160;the nearest stairs while all&#160;around me&#160;monsters&#160;<br/>
and demigods shouted orders and strapped on&#160;their&#160;weapons. I was empty-handed. Riptide,&#160;being magic,&#160;<br/>would appear in my&#160;pocket&#160;sooner or&#160;later, but for now&#160;it was&#160;stuck somewhere&#160;under the wreckage of the&#160;<br/>crab, and I had no time to retrieve it.&#160;<br/>
In the elevator foyer&#160;on&#160;deck eight, a couple of&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;</i>slithered across&#160;my&#160;path. From&#160;the waist&#160;<br/>
up, they&#160;were women&#160;with&#160;green scaly&#160;skin,&#160;yellow eyes, and forked tongues. From the waist down, they&#160;<br/>had double snake trunks instead of legs. They&#160;held&#160;spears and weighted nets, and I knew from&#160;experience&#160;<br/>they could&#160;use them.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What isss thisss?&#34; one said. &#34;A prize for Kronosss!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wasn't&#160;in the&#160;mood to play&#160;break-the-snake, but in&#160;front of me&#160;was a stand with a&#160;model of the ship,&#160;<br/>
like a YOU&#160;ARE HERE&#160;display. I ripped the model off the pedestal and hurled it at the first&#160;<i>iracaena.&#160;<br/></i>The boat smacked her in the face and&#160;she went down&#160;with the ship. I jumped&#160;over her, grabbed her&#160;<br/>friend's spear, and swung&#160;her around. She slammed into&#160;the elevator, and I&#160;kept&#160;running toward the front&#160;<br/>of the ship.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Get him!&#34; she screamed.&#160;<br/>
Hellhounds bayed. An arrow from&#160;somewhere whizzed&#160;past&#160;my&#160;face and&#160;impaled itself in the&#160;<br/>
mahogany-paneled wall of the stairwell.&#160;<br/>
I didn't care—as long as I got the monsters away&#160;from&#160;the engine room&#160;and gave Beckendorf more&#160;<br/>
time.&#160;<br/>
As I&#160;was&#160;running up&#160;the stairwell, a kid charged down. He looked like he'd&#160;just&#160;woken up from a nap.&#160;<br/>
His armor was half on. He&#160;drew his sword and&#160;yelled,&#160;&#34;Kronos!&#34; but he sounded more scared than angry.&#160;<br/>He couldn't have been&#160;more than twelve—about the same&#160;age I was when I'd first arrived at&#160;Camp&#160;Half-<br/>Blood.&#160;<br/>
That thought&#160;depressed&#160;me. This kid was getting brainwashed—trained to hate the gods and lash out&#160;<br/>
because he'd&#160;been born&#160;half Olympian. Kronos was using him,&#160;and&#160;yet the kid&#160;thought&#160;I was his enemy.&#160;<br/>
No way&#160;was I going to hurt him.&#160;I didn't need&#160;a&#160;weapon for this. I stepped inside his&#160;strike and&#160;<br/>
grabbed his&#160;wrist, slamming it against the wall. His sword clattered out&#160;of his hand.&#160;<br/>
Then I did something I&#160;hadn't planned on.&#160;It was&#160;probably stupid. It&#160;definitely&#160;jeopardized our&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=9></a>mission, but I&#160;couldn't help&#160;it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;If you want&#160;to live,&#34; I told&#160;him,&#160;&#34;get off this ship&#160;<i>now.&#160;</i>Tell the other demigods.&#34; Then I shoved him&#160;<br/>
down the stairs and sent him&#160;tumbling to the next floor.&#160;<br/>
I kept climbing.&#160;<br/>
Bad&#160;memories: a hallway&#160;ran past the cafeteria. Annabeth, my&#160;half&#160;brother Tyson, and&#160;I had sneaked&#160;<br/>
through here&#160;three years ago on my&#160;first&#160;visit.&#160;<br/>
I burst&#160;outside&#160;onto&#160;the main deck. Off the port&#160;bow,&#160;the sky&#160;was darkening from&#160;purple to black. A&#160;<br/>
swimming pool glowed&#160;between two glass towers&#160;with&#160;more balconies and restaurant decks. The whole&#160;<br/>upper ship seemed eerily&#160;deserted.&#160;<br/>
All I had to do was cross to&#160;the other side. Then&#160;I could take the staircase down to the helipad—our&#160;<br/>
emergency&#160;rendezvous point. With any&#160;luck, Beckendorf would&#160;meet&#160;me there. We'd&#160;jump&#160;into the sea.&#160;<br/>My&#160;water powers would protect us both,&#160;and we'd&#160;detonate the charges from&#160;a quarter&#160;mile away.&#160;<br/>
I was halfway across the deck when the sound&#160;of&#160;a voice&#160;made&#160;me&#160;freeze. &#34;You're late, Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Luke stood on&#160;the balcony above me, a&#160;smile on his scarred face.&#160;He wore jeans, a white T-shirt, and&#160;<br/>
flip-flops, like&#160;he was just&#160;a normal college-age guy,&#160;but his eyes told the truth.&#160;They&#160;were solid gold.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We've been&#160;expecting you for days.&#34;&#160;At first&#160;he&#160;sounded normal, like Luke. But then his face&#160;<br/>
twitched. A shudder passed through his&#160;body&#160;as though he'd&#160;just drunk something really&#160;nasty. His voice<i>&#160;<br/></i>became heavier, ancient, and powerful—the voice of&#160;the Titan lord&#160;Kronos. The words scraped down my&#160;<br/>spine like a knife blade. &#34;Come, bow before&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah, that'll&#160;happen,&#34; I muttered.&#160;<br/>
Laistrygonian giants filed in on either side of the swimming pool as if they'd&#160;been waiting for a cue.&#160;<br/>
Each was&#160;eight feet tall with tattooed arms, leather&#160;armor, and spiked clubs. Demigod archers appeared on&#160;<br/>the roof above&#160;Luke. Two&#160;hellhounds leaped down from&#160;the opposite balcony&#160;and snarled at&#160;me. Within&#160;<br/>seconds I was surrounded. A trap: there's no way&#160;they&#160;could've gotten into position so fast unless they'd&#160;<br/>known I was coming.&#160;<br/>
I looked up at Luke, and anger boiled inside&#160;me.&#160;I&#160;didn't know if&#160;Luke's&#160;consciousness was&#160;even still&#160;<br/>
alive inside that body. Maybe, the way&#160;his voice had&#160;changed . . .&#160;or&#160;maybe it was just Kronos adapting to&#160;<br/>his new form.&#160;I told&#160;myself it didn't&#160;matter. Luke had&#160;been twisted&#160;and evil long before Kronos possessed&#160;<br/>him.&#160;<br/>
A voice<i>&#160;</i>in my head said:&#160;<i>I have to fight&#160;him eventually. Why not now?</i>&#160;<br/>
According to&#160;that big&#160;prophecy, I was supposed to&#160;make a choice&#160;that saved or destroyed the world&#160;<br/>
when I was&#160;sixteen. That was&#160;only&#160;seven days&#160;away. Why&#160;not&#160;now? If I really&#160;had the power, what&#160;<br/>difference would a week&#160;make? I could&#160;end this threat right here by&#160;taking&#160;down Kronos. Hey, I'd fought&#160;<br/>monsters and gods before.&#160;<br/>
As if<i>&#160;</i>reading my&#160;thoughts,&#160;Luke smiled. No, he was&#160;<i>Kronos.&#160;</i>I had to&#160;remember that.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a>&#34;Come forward,&#34; he said. &#34;If you&#160;dare.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The crowd of monsters parted. I moved up the stairs, my&#160;heart pounding. I was sure somebody&#160;would&#160;<br/>
stab&#160;me&#160;in the back, but they&#160;let me&#160;pass. I felt&#160;my&#160;pocket and found my&#160;pen waiting. I uncapped it, and&#160;<br/>Riptide grew into a sword.&#160;<br/>
Kronos's&#160;weapon appeared in his hands—a six-foot-long scythe,&#160;half Celestial bronze, half&#160;mortal&#160;<br/>
steel. Just looking at the&#160;thing made&#160;my&#160;knees turn&#160;to Jell-O. But before I&#160;could change&#160;my&#160;mind, I&#160;<br/>charged.&#160;<br/>
Time&#160;slowed&#160;down.&#160;I mean&#160;<i>literally&#160;</i>slowed down, because&#160;Kronos&#160;had that power. I felt like I was&#160;<br/>
moving through syrup.&#160;My&#160;arms&#160;were&#160;so heavy,&#160;I could barely&#160;raise<i>&#160;</i>my&#160;sword. Kronos smiled, swirling&#160;<br/>his scythe at&#160;normal speed&#160;and waiting for me to creep toward my&#160;death.&#160;<br/>
I tried to fight his magic. I concentrated on the sea around me—the source of my&#160;power. I'd gotten&#160;<br/>
better at channeling it&#160;over&#160;the&#160;years,&#160;but now nothing&#160;seemed to happen.&#160;<br/>
I took another slow step forward. Giants jeered.&#160;<i>Dracaenae&#160;</i>hissed with laughter.&#160;<br/>
<i>Hey, ocean,&#160;</i>I pleaded.&#160;<i>Any day now would be good.</i>&#160;<br/>
Suddenly there was a wrenching pain&#160;in&#160;my&#160;gut. The&#160;entire boat lurched sideways,&#160;throwing&#160;monsters&#160;<br/>
off their feet. Four thousand gallons of&#160;salt water&#160;surged out&#160;of&#160;the swimming pool, dousing me and&#160;<br/>Kronos and everyone on&#160;the deck. The water revitalized&#160;me, breaking the&#160;time&#160;spell,&#160;and I lunged&#160;<br/>forward.&#160;<br/>
I struck at Kronos, but I was still too slow. I&#160;made the&#160;mistake of looking at his&#160;face—<i>Luke's face</i>—a&#160;<br/>
guy&#160;who was once my&#160;friend. As much as I hated him,&#160;it was hard to kill&#160;him.&#160;<br/>
Kronos had no such hesitation. He&#160;sliced downward with his scythe.&#160;I leaped back, and the evil blade&#160;<br/>
missed by&#160;an&#160;inch, cutting&#160;a gash in&#160;the&#160;deck right between&#160;my&#160;feet.&#160;<br/>
I kicked Kronos in the chest. He stumbled backward, but&#160;he was heavier than Luke should've been. It&#160;<br/>
was like kicking a refrigerator.&#160;<br/>
Kronos swung his scythe&#160;again. I intercepted with Riptide, but&#160;his strike was so powerful,&#160;my&#160;blade&#160;<br/>
could only&#160;deflect it. The edge of the&#160;scythe shaved&#160;off&#160;my&#160;shirtsleeve&#160;and grazed&#160;my&#160;arm.&#160;It shouldn't&#160;<br/>have been a&#160;serious cut, but the entire&#160;side of&#160;my&#160;body&#160;exploded with pain. I&#160;remembered&#160;what a&#160;sea&#160;<br/>demon had once said about Kronos's&#160;scythe:&#160;<i>Careful, fool. One touch, and the&#160;blade will sever your soul&#160;</i><br/>
<i>from your body.&#160;</i>Now I understood what he meant. I wasn't&#160;just losing blood. I&#160;could feel my&#160;strength, my&#160;<br/>will, my&#160;identity&#160;draining&#160;away.&#160;<br/>
I stumbled backward, switched my&#160;sword to my&#160;left hand, and lunged&#160;desperately.&#160;My blade&#160;<br/>
should've run him&#160;through,&#160;but it&#160;deflected off his stomach like I&#160;was hitting solid marble.&#160;There was no&#160;<br/>way&#160;he should've&#160;survived that.&#160;<br/>
Kronos laughed. &#34;A poor&#160;performance,&#160;Percy&#160;Jackson.&#160;Luke tells&#160;me&#160;you were never his&#160;match at&#160;<br/>
swordplay.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=11></a>My vision started to&#160;blur. I knew I&#160;didn't have much&#160;time. &#34;Luke had a big head,&#34; I said. &#34;But&#160;at least&#160;<br/>
it was&#160;<i>his&#160;</i>head.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;A shame to kill&#160;you&#160;now,&#34; Kronos mused, &#34;before the final plan unfolds. I would love to&#160;see the&#160;<br/>
terror in&#160;your&#160;eyes when&#160;you realize how I will destroy Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You'll never get this boat&#160;to Manhattan.&#34; My&#160;arm&#160;was throbbing.&#160;Black spots danced in my&#160;vision.&#160;<br/>
&#34;And why&#160;would that be?&#34; Kronos's&#160;golden eyes&#160;glittered. His&#160;face—Luke's face—seemed like a&#160;<br/>
mask, unnatural and lit from&#160;behind by&#160;some&#160;evil power. &#34;Perhaps you are counting&#160;on&#160;your&#160;friend with&#160;<br/>the explosives?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He looked down at the pool and called, &#34;Nakamura!&#34;&#160;<br/>
A teenage guy in&#160;full Greek armor pushed through&#160;the&#160;crowd. His left eye was covered with&#160;a black&#160;<br/>
patch. I knew&#160;him,&#160;of course: Ethan Nakamura, the son&#160;of Nemesis. I'd saved his life in the Labyrinth last&#160;<br/>summer, and in return, the little punk had&#160;helped Kronos come&#160;back to life.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Success,&#160;my&#160;lord,&#34; Ethan&#160;called. &#34;We found him&#160;just as we were told.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He&#160;clapped his hands, and&#160;two giants lumbered forward, dragging&#160;Charles&#160;Beckendorf between them.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;heart almost stopped.&#160;Beckendorf had a swollen&#160;eye and cuts all over his face&#160;and arms. His armor&#160;<br/>was gone and his shirt was nearly&#160;torn off.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; I&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf met&#160;my&#160;eyes. He glanced&#160;at his hand like he was trying to tell me&#160;something.&#160;<i>His watch.&#160;</i><br/>
They&#160;hadn't taken it yet, and that was the detonator.&#160;Was it possible the explosives were armed?&#160;Surely&#160;<br/>the monsters&#160;would've dismantled them&#160;right away.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We found him amidships,&#34; one of the&#160;giants said, &#34;trying to sneak to the engine room. Can we eat&#160;<br/>
him&#160;now?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Soon.&#34; Kronos scowled at Ethan. &#34;Are you sure he didn't set the explosives?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He was going&#160;<i>toward&#160;</i>the engine room, my&#160;lord.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;How do&#160;you&#160;know that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Er . .&#160;.&#34; Ethan shifted uncomfortably.&#160;&#34;He was heading&#160;in that direction. And&#160;he told&#160;us.&#160;His bag is&#160;<br/>
still full of explosives.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Slowly, I began to understand. Beckendorf&#160;had fooled them. When he'd&#160;realized<i>&#160;</i>he was going to be&#160;<br/>
captured, he turned to make it look like&#160;he was going&#160;the other way. He'd&#160;convinced them&#160;he hadn't&#160;made&#160;<br/>it to the engine room&#160;yet. The Greek fire&#160;might still&#160;be primed! But that didn't do us any&#160;good unless we&#160;<br/>could get off&#160;the ship and&#160;detonate it.&#160;<br/>
Kronos hesitated.&#160;<br/>
<i>Buy the story,&#160;</i>I prayed. The pain in my&#160;arm&#160;was so bad now I could barely stand.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Open his bag,&#34; Kronos&#160;ordered.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a>One of the&#160;giants ripped the explosives&#160;satchel&#160;from Beckendorf's shoulders. He peered inside,&#160;<br/>
grunted, and turned it upside&#160;down. Panicked monsters&#160;surged backward. If the bag&#160;really&#160;had&#160;been full of&#160;<br/>Greek fire jars, we would've&#160;all blown up. But what fell out were a&#160;dozen cans of peaches.&#160;<br/>
I could hear&#160;Kronos breathing, trying&#160;to&#160;control&#160;his&#160;anger.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Did&#160;you,&#160;perhaps,&#34; he said, &#34;capture this demigod near the galley?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan turned&#160;pale. &#34;Um—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And did&#160;you,&#160;perhaps, send someone to actually&#160;CHECK THE ENGINE ROOM?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan scrambled back in terror, then turned on his&#160;heels and ran.&#160;<br/>
I cursed silently. Now we had only minutes before&#160;the bombs were disarmed. I caught Beckendorf's&#160;<br/>
eyes again and asked a silent question,&#160;hoping&#160;he would understand:&#160;<i>How long?</i>&#160;<br/>
He cupped his fingers and thumb,&#160;making a circle.&#160;<i>Zero.&#160;</i>There was no delay&#160;on the timer&#160;at&#160;all. If he&#160;<br/>
managed to press the detonator button, the ship would&#160;blow at once. We'd&#160;never&#160;be able to get far&#160;enough&#160;<br/>away&#160;before using it. The&#160;monsters would kill&#160;us first, or disarm&#160;the explosives, or both.&#160;<br/>
Kronos turned toward&#160;me&#160;with a&#160;crooked smile. &#34;You'll have to excuse&#160;my&#160;incompetent help, Percy&#160;<br/>
Jackson. But it doesn't&#160;matter. We have you&#160;now. We've known&#160;you were coming&#160;for weeks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He held out his hand and&#160;dangled a little silver bracelet with a scythe charm—the Titan lord's&#160;symbol.&#160;<br/>
The wound in&#160;my&#160;arm&#160;was sapping my&#160;ability&#160;to think,&#160;but I&#160;muttered, &#34;Communication device . . .&#160;<br/>
spy&#160;at camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos chuckled. &#34;You can't&#160;count&#160;on friends. They&#160;will always let you down. Luke learned that&#160;<br/>
lesson the hard way.&#160;Now&#160;drop&#160;your sword and surrender to me, or your friend&#160;dies.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I swallowed. One of the giants had his&#160;hand around&#160;Beckendorf's&#160;neck. I was in&#160;no shape to rescue&#160;<br/>
him,&#160;and even if I tried,&#160;he would die&#160;before I got there. We both would.&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf mouthed one word:&#160;<i>Go.</i>&#160;<br/>
I shook my&#160;head. I couldn't just leave him.&#160;<br/>
The second giant was still&#160;rummaging through the&#160;peach cans, which meant Beckendorf's&#160;left&#160;arm&#160;<br/>
was free. He&#160;raised it slowly—toward the watch on his right wrist.&#160;<br/>
I wanted to scream,&#160;<i>NO!</i>&#160;<br/>
Then down&#160;by&#160;the swimming pool,&#160;one&#160;of the&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;</i>hissed, &#34;What isss he doing?&#160;What&#160;isss that&#160;<br/>
on hisss wrissst?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf closed eyes tight and brought&#160;his hand&#160;up&#160;to his watch.&#160;<br/>
I had&#160;no choice. I threw my sword like&#160;a javelin at&#160;Kronos. It&#160;bounced harmlessly off&#160;his chest, but it&#160;<br/>
did startle him.&#160;I pushed through a crowd of monsters&#160;and jumped off the side of the ship—toward the&#160;<br/>water a hundred feet below.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a>I heard rumbling&#160;deep in the ship. Monsters yelled&#160;at&#160;me from&#160;above. A spear sailed past my&#160;ear. An&#160;<br/>
arrow pierced my&#160;thigh, but I barely&#160;had time to register the pain. I plunged&#160;into the sea and willed the&#160;<br/>currents to take me far, far away—a hundred&#160;yards, two hundred&#160;yards.&#160;<br/>
Even from&#160;that distance, the explosion shook the&#160;world. Heat seared the back of my&#160;head. The&#160;<br/>
<i>Princess Andromeda&#160;</i>blew&#160;up from&#160;both&#160;sides, a massive fireball of&#160;green flame roiling into the dark sky,&#160;<br/>consuming everything.&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf, I thought.&#160;<br/>
Then I blacked out and sank like an anchor toward the&#160;bottom&#160;of the sea.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
TWO&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;MEET &#160;SOME &#160;FISHY&#160;<br/>
RELATIVES&#160;<br/>
<i>&#160;<br/></i>Demigod dreams&#160;suck.&#160;<br/>
The thing is,&#160;they're never&#160;just&#160;<i>dreams.&#160;</i>They've got&#160;to&#160;be&#160;visions,&#160;omens, and all that&#160;other&#160;mystical&#160;<br/>
stuff that makes&#160;my&#160;brain hurt.&#160;<br/>
I dreamed I&#160;was in a dark&#160;palace at the&#160;top of a&#160;mountain. Unfortunately, I recognized it: the palace of&#160;<br/>
the Titans on&#160;top of Mount Othrys, otherwise known as Mount Tamalpais, in California. The&#160;main&#160;<br/>pavilion was open to the night, ringed with black Greek columns&#160;and statues&#160;of the Titans. Torchlight&#160;<br/>glowed against the black&#160;marble floor. In the center&#160;of the room, an armored giant struggled&#160;under the&#160;<br/>weight of a swirling funnel cloud—Atlas, holding&#160;up&#160;the sky.&#160;<br/>
Two other giant men stood nearby&#160;over a bronze brazier, studying&#160;images in the flames.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Quite an explosion,&#34;&#160;one&#160;said. He wore black armor studded with silver dots like a starry&#160;night. His&#160;<br/>
face was covered in a war&#160;helm&#160;with a ram's horn curling on either&#160;side.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It doesn't&#160;matter,&#34; the other said. This Titan was&#160;dressed in gold robes, with golden eyes like Kronos.&#160;<br/>
His entire body&#160;glowed. He reminded&#160;me of Apollo,&#160;God&#160;of the Sun, except the Titan's light was harsher,&#160;<br/>and his expression crueler. &#34;The gods have answered the challenge. Soon they&#160;will&#160;be destroyed.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The images&#160;in the fire were hard&#160;to&#160;make out: storms, buildings&#160;crumbling, mortals screaming in&#160;<br/>
terror.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will go east to marshal&#160;our forces,&#34; the golden&#160;Titan said. &#34;Krios,&#160;you shall remain and&#160;guard&#160;<br/>
Mount Othrys.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The ram&#160;horn&#160;dude&#160;grunted. &#34;I always&#160;get the stupid&#160;jobs. Lord&#160;of&#160;the South.&#160;Lord of&#160;Constellations.&#160;<br/>
Now I get to&#160;babysit Atlas while&#160;<i>you&#160;</i>have all the fun.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Under the whirlwind of clouds, Atlas bellowed in agony, &#34;Let me&#160;out, curse&#160;you! I am&#160;your&#160;greatest&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=14></a>warrior. Take my&#160;burden so&#160;I may&#160;fight!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Quiet!&#34; the golden Titan&#160;roared. &#34;You had&#160;your&#160;chance, Atlas. You failed.&#160;Kronos likes you just&#160;<br/>
where you&#160;are. As for you,&#160;Krios, do&#160;your duty.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And if&#160;you&#160;need more warriors?&#34; Krios asked. &#34;Our treacherous nephew in the tuxedo will not&#160;do<i>&#160;</i><br/>
you much good in a fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The golden Titan laughed.&#160;&#34;Don't worry&#160;about&#160;him.&#160;Besides, the gods can barely&#160;handle our&#160;first little&#160;<br/>
challenge. They&#160;have no&#160;idea how many&#160;others we have&#160;in store. Mark my&#160;words, in a few days' time,&#160;<br/>Olympus will be in ruins, and we<i>&#160;</i>will meet here again&#160;to celebrate the dawn of the Sixth Age!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The golden Titan erupted into flames and disappeared.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, sure,&#34; Krios grumbled. &#34;He gets to erupt into&#160;flames. I get to wear these stupid ram's horns.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The scene&#160;shifted. Now I was outside the pavilion,&#160;hiding in the shadows of a Greek column. A boy&#160;<br/>
stood next to&#160;me, eavesdropping&#160;on&#160;the Titans. He&#160;had&#160;dark silky&#160;hair, pale skin, and&#160;dark&#160;clothes—my&#160;<br/>friend Nico di&#160;Angelo, the&#160;son of Hades.&#160;<br/>
He looked straight at me,&#160;his expression grim. &#34;You&#160;see, Percy?&#34;&#160;he whispered. &#34;You're running&#160;out&#160;<br/>
of time. Do you really&#160;think&#160;you can beat them&#160;without my&#160;plan?&#34;&#160;<br/>
His words washed over me&#160;as cold as the&#160;ocean floor,&#160;and my&#160;dreams went black.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy?&#34; a deep voice said.&#160;<br/>
My head felt like it had&#160;been microwaved in aluminum&#160;foil. I opened my&#160;eyes and saw a large&#160;<br/>
shadowy&#160;figure looming over&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Beckendorf?&#34; I asked hopefully.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, brother.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;eyes refocused. I&#160;was&#160;looking&#160;at a&#160;Cyclops—a&#160;misshapen face, ratty&#160;brown hair, one&#160;big brown&#160;<br/>
eye full&#160;of concern. &#34;Tyson?&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;brother broke into a toothy&#160;grin. &#34;Yay! Your&#160;brain works!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wasn't&#160;so sure. My body&#160;felt weightless and cold.&#160;My&#160;voice sounded wrong.&#160;I&#160;could hear Tyson, but&#160;<br/>
it was&#160;more like I was hearing vibrations&#160;inside my&#160;skull, not the regular sounds.&#160;<br/>
I sat up, and a gossamer&#160;sheet floated&#160;away. I was&#160;on a bed made of silky&#160;woven kelp, in&#160;a room&#160;<br/>
paneled with abalone shell. Glowing pearls the size&#160;of basketballs floated around the ceiling, providing&#160;<br/>light. I was under water.&#160;<br/>
Now, being the son of Poseidon and all,&#160;I was okay&#160;with this. I can breathe underwater just fine, and&#160;<br/>
my&#160;clothes&#160;don't even get&#160;wet unless I&#160;want them to. But it&#160;was still a bit of&#160;a&#160;shock when a&#160;hammerhead&#160;<br/>shark drifted&#160;through the bedroom&#160;window, regarded&#160;me,&#160;and then swam calmly&#160;out the opposite side of&#160;<br/>the room.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Where—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Daddy's palace,&#34; Tyson said.&#160;<br/>
Under different circumstances, I would've been excited. I'd never&#160;visited Poseidon's realm,&#160;and I'd&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=15></a>been dreaming about&#160;it for&#160;years. But my&#160;head hurt.&#160;My shirt was still speckled with burn marks from&#160;the&#160;<br/>explosion. My&#160;arm&#160;and leg&#160;wounds had&#160;healed—just&#160;being in the ocean can do that for&#160;me, given enough&#160;<br/>time—but I still felt like I'd been trampled by&#160;a Laistrygonian soccer team&#160;in cleats.&#160;<br/>
&#34;How long—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We found&#160;you last night,&#34; Tyson said,&#160;&#34;sinking&#160;through the water.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda</i>?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Went ka-boom,&#34; Tyson confirmed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Beckendorf was on board.&#160;Did&#160;you&#160;find&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Tyson's face&#160;darkened. &#34;No sign of&#160;him.&#160;I am&#160;sorry, brother.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared out the window into deep&#160;blue&#160;water. Beckendorf was supposed to&#160;go&#160;to college in&#160;the fall.&#160;<br/>
He had a girlfriend, lots of&#160;friends, his&#160;whole life ahead of him.&#160;He couldn't be&#160;<i>gone.&#160;</i>Maybe&#160;he'd&#160;made&#160;it&#160;<br/>off the ship like I had. Maybe he'd&#160;jumped over the side . . . and what? He couldn't have survived a&#160;<br/>hundred-foot&#160;fall into the&#160;water like I&#160;could. He couldn't have put enough distance between&#160;himself&#160;and&#160;<br/>the explosion.&#160;<br/>
I knew in my&#160;gut he was dead. He'd&#160;sacrificed himself to take out the&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda,&#160;</i>and I had&#160;<br/>
abandoned him.&#160;<br/>
I thought about my&#160;dream:&#160;the Titans discussing the explosion as if it didn't matter, Nico di Angelo&#160;<br/>
warning me&#160;that I would&#160;never beat Kronos without&#160;following his plan—a&#160;dangerous&#160;idea I'd been&#160;<br/>avoiding&#160;for&#160;more than a year.&#160;<br/>
A distant blast shook the room. Green light blazed outside, turning the whole sea&#160;as bright as noon.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What was that?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
Tyson looked worried. &#34;Daddy&#160;will explain.&#160;Come, he is blowing&#160;up monsters.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The palace&#160;might have been the&#160;most&#160;amazing place&#160;I'd&#160;ever&#160;seen if&#160;it hadn't&#160;been in the process of getting&#160;<br/>destroyed. We&#160;swam&#160;to the end of a long hallway&#160;and shot upward on a geyser. As&#160;we rose over the&#160;<br/>rooftops I caught my&#160;breath—well, if you can catch your breath underwater.&#160;<br/>
The palace was as big as the city&#160;on Mount Olympus, with wide&#160;courtyards, gardens, and columned&#160;<br/>
pavilions. The gardens were sculpted with coral&#160;colonies and glowing sea plants. Twenty&#160;or thirty&#160;<br/>buildings were&#160;made of abalone, white&#160;but gleaming&#160;with rainbow colors. Fish and octopi&#160;darted in and&#160;<br/>out of the windows. The paths were lined&#160;with glowing pearls like Christmas lights.&#160;<br/>
The&#160;main&#160;courtyard was filled with warriors—mermen with fish tails from the waist down and&#160;human&#160;<br/>
bodies from&#160;the waist up,&#160;except their skin was blue,&#160;which I'd never known&#160;before. Some&#160;were tending&#160;<br/>the wounded. Some&#160;were&#160;sharpening spears&#160;and swords. One passed us,&#160;swimming in a hurry. His eyes&#160;<br/>were bright green, like that stuff they&#160;put in glo-sticks, and his teeth were shark teeth. They don't show&#160;<br/>you stuff like&#160;that in&#160;<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>&#160;<br/>
Outside the main courtyard stood large fortifications—towers, walls,&#160;and&#160;antisiege weapons—but&#160;<br/>
most of these had been smashed to ruins. Others&#160;were blazing with a strange green light that I knew&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a>well—Greek&#160;fire, which can burn even underwater.&#160;<br/>
Beyond this, the sea floor stretched into gloom. I could see battles raging—flashes of energy,&#160;<br/>
explosions, the glint&#160;of armies clashing. A regular&#160;human would've found it&#160;too&#160;dark to&#160;see. Heck, a&#160;<br/>regular human would've been crushed by the pressure&#160;and frozen by the cold. Even my&#160;heat-sensitive eyes&#160;<br/>couldn't make out exactly&#160;what was going on.&#160;<br/>
At the edge of the palace complex, a temple with&#160;a red coral roof exploded,&#160;sending fire and debris&#160;<br/>
streaming in slow&#160;motion across the&#160;farthest gardens. Out of the darkness&#160;above, an enormous form&#160;<br/>appeared—a&#160;squid larger than any&#160;skyscraper. It&#160;was surrounded by&#160;a glittering cloud of dust—at least&#160;I&#160;<br/>thought it was dust, until I&#160;realized it was a swarm of&#160;mermen trying to attack&#160;the monster. The squid&#160;<br/>descended on the palace and swatted&#160;its tentacles, smashing a whole column&#160;of warriors.&#160;Then a brilliant&#160;<br/>arc of blue light shot from the rooftop&#160;of&#160;one of the tallest buildings. The light&#160;hit the giant squid, and the&#160;<br/>monster dissolved like food coloring in water.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Daddy,&#34; Tyson said, pointing to where the light&#160;had come from.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;He&#160;</i>did that?&#34; I suddenly&#160;felt more hopeful. My&#160;dad&#160;had unbelievable powers. He was the god of&#160;the&#160;<br/>
sea. He&#160;could deal with this attack, right?&#160;Maybe he'd let me help.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Have you&#160;been in the fight?&#34; I asked Tyson in awe. &#34;Like bashing heads with your awesome Cyclops&#160;<br/>
strength and stuff?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Tyson pouted, and immediately&#160;I&#160;knew I'd asked a bad question,&#160;&#34;I&#160;have been . .&#160;. fixing&#160;weapons,&#34; he&#160;<br/>
mumbled. &#34;Come. Let's go find Daddy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I know this&#160;might sound&#160;weird to people with, like,&#160;regular parents, but&#160;I'd&#160;only seen my&#160;dad four&#160;or&#160;five&#160;<br/>times in&#160;my&#160;life, and never for&#160;more than a few&#160;minutes. The&#160;Greek gods don't exactly&#160;show up for their&#160;<br/>kids'&#160;basketball games. Still, I thought&#160;I&#160;would recognize Poseidon on sight.&#160;<br/>
I was wrong.&#160;<br/>
The roof of the temple was a big open&#160;deck that&#160;had been set up&#160;as a command&#160;center. A mosaic on&#160;<br/>
the floor&#160;showed an exact map of the&#160;palace grounds and the surrounding ocean, but the mosaic&#160;moved.&#160;<br/>Colored stone tiles representing different armies and&#160;sea&#160;monsters&#160;shifted around as the forces&#160;changed&#160;<br/>position. Buildings that collapsed in real&#160;life also collapsed in the picture.&#160;<br/>
Standing around the mosaic, grimly&#160;studying the&#160;battle, was a strange assortment of warriors, but&#160;<br/>
none of them&#160;looked like&#160;my&#160;dad. I was&#160;searching for a big guy&#160;with a good tan and a black beard,&#160;<br/>wearing Bermuda shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.&#160;<br/>
There was nobody&#160;like that. One guy&#160;was a&#160;merman&#160;with two fish tails instead&#160;of one. His skin was&#160;<br/>
green, his armor studded with pearls. His black hair&#160;was tied in&#160;a ponytail,&#160;and he looked&#160;young—though&#160;<br/>it's hard to tell with non-humans. They&#160;could be a thousand&#160;years old or three. Standing next&#160;to him&#160;was&#160;<br/>an old man with a bushy&#160;white beard and gray&#160;hair.&#160;His battle armor&#160;seemed to&#160;weigh him&#160;down. He had&#160;<br/>green eyes and smile wrinkles around&#160;his eyes, but he&#160;wasn't&#160;smiling now. He&#160;was studying&#160;the map and&#160;<br/>leaning on a large&#160;metal staff. To his right stood a&#160;beautiful woman in green armor with flowing black&#160;<br/>hair and strange little horns like crab claws. And there was a dolphin—just a regular dolphin, but&#160;it was&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>staring at the map intently.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Delphin,&#34; the old man said. &#34;Send Palaemon and his&#160;legion of sharks to the western front. We have&#160;<br/>
to neutralize those leviathans.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The dolphin&#160;spoke in a chattering voice,&#160;but I could understand&#160;it in my&#160;mind:&#160;<i>Yes, lord!&#160;</i>It sped&#160;<br/>
away.&#160;<br/>
I looked in&#160;dismay&#160;at Tyson, then&#160;back at the old man.&#160;<br/>
It didn't seem possible, but&#160;. . . &#34;Dad?&#34; I&#160;asked.&#160;<br/>
The old&#160;man&#160;looked up. I recognized the twinkle in his eyes, but his face . . . he&#160;looked like he'd&#160;aged&#160;<br/>
forty&#160;years.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hello, Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What—what happened to&#160;you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Tyson nudged me. He was&#160;shaking his&#160;head so hard&#160;I was afraid it would&#160;fall off, but&#160;Poseidon didn't&#160;<br/>
look offended.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's all right, Tyson,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;Percy, excuse&#160;my&#160;appearance. The&#160;war has been&#160;hard on me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But&#160;you're immortal,&#34; I said quietly.&#160;&#34;You can look&#160;. . . any way&#160;you want.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I reflect the state of&#160;my&#160;realm,&#34; he&#160;said. &#34;And right now that state is quite grim. Percy,&#160;I should&#160;<br/>
introduce&#160;you—I'm afraid&#160;you just&#160;missed&#160;my&#160;lieutenant Delphin, God of the&#160;Dolphins. This is&#160;my, er,&#160;<br/>wife, Amphitrite. My dear—<i>&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
The lady&#160;in&#160;green armor stared at&#160;me&#160;coldly, then crossed her arms&#160;and said, &#34;Excuse&#160;me,&#160;my lord. I&#160;<br/>
am&#160;needed in the battle.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She swam&#160;away.&#160;<br/>
I felt pretty&#160;awkward, but I guess I&#160;couldn't blame&#160;her. I'd never&#160;thought about it&#160;much, but my&#160;dad&#160;<br/>
had an immortal wife.&#160;All&#160;his romances with&#160;mortals, including&#160;with&#160;my&#160;mom . . . well,&#160;Amphitrite&#160;<br/>probably didn't like that&#160;much.&#160;<br/>
Poseidon cleared his throat.&#160;&#34;Yes, well . . . and this is&#160;my&#160;son Triton. Er, my&#160;<i>other&#160;</i>son.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your son&#160;and heir,&#34;&#160;the&#160;green dude&#160;corrected. His double fish&#160;tails swished back and forth. He&#160;<br/>
smiled at&#160;me,&#160;but there was no friendliness in his eyes.&#160;&#34;Hello, Perseus Jackson. Come to help at last?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He acted like I was late or lazy. If&#160;you can blush&#160;underwater, I probably&#160;did.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tell me what to do,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Triton smiled&#160;like that was a cute suggestion—like I&#160;was a slightly amusing dog that&#160;had barked for&#160;<br/>
him&#160;or something. He turned to Poseidon. &#34;I&#160;will see to the front line, Father. Don't worry.&#160;<i>I</i>&#160;will not fail.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He nodded politely&#160;to Tyson. How come I didn't get&#160;that&#160;much&#160;respect? Then he shot off into the&#160;<br/>
water.&#160;<br/>
Poseidon sighed. He raised his staff,&#160;and it changed into his regular weapon—a huge three-pointed&#160;<br/>
trident. The tip glowed with&#160;blue light, and the water around it&#160;boiled with energy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;sorry&#160;about that,&#34;&#160;he told me.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a>A huge sea serpent appeared from&#160;above us&#160;and spiraled down toward the roof. It was bright orange&#160;<br/>
with a fanged mouth big enough&#160;to swallow a gymnasium.&#160;<br/>
Hardly&#160;looking up, Poseidon pointed his trident at the beast&#160;and zapped it with blue energy.&#160;<i>Ka-boom!&#160;</i><br/>
The<i>&#160;</i>monster&#160;burst into a million goldfish, which all swam&#160;off in terror.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My family&#160;is&#160;anxious,&#34; Poseidon continued as if<i>&#160;</i>nothing had&#160;happened. &#34;The&#160;battle against Oceanus&#160;<br/>
is going&#160;poorly.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He pointed to the edge&#160;of the mosaic.&#160;With the&#160;butt of his&#160;trident he tapped the image of a&#160;merman&#160;<br/>
larger than the rest, with the horns of a&#160;bull. He appeared to be riding a chariot pulled by crawfish, and&#160;<br/>instead of a sword he wielded a live serpent.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oceanus,&#34; I said, trying to remember. &#34;The Titan of the sea?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Poseidon nodded. &#34;He was neutral in the first war&#160;of gods and Titans. But Kronos has convinced him&#160;<br/>
to fight. This&#160;is . . . well, it's not&#160;a good sign. Oceanus would not commit unless&#160;he was sure he&#160;could pick&#160;<br/>the winning side.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He looks stupid,&#34; I said, trying to&#160;sound&#160;upbeat. &#34;I mean, who fights with a snake?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Daddy will tie it in knots,&#34; Tyson said&#160;firmly.&#160;<br/>
Poseidon smiled, but&#160;he looked weary.&#160;&#34;I appreciate&#160;your faith. We&#160;have been&#160;at war almost a&#160;year&#160;<br/>
now. My&#160;powers are taxed. And still&#160;he finds new forces to throw at&#160;me—sea monsters&#160;so ancient I had&#160;<br/>forgotten about them.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I heard an&#160;explosion in the&#160;distance.&#160;About half&#160;a&#160;mile away, a&#160;mountain of coral disintegrated under&#160;<br/>
the weight of&#160;two giant creatures. I could dimly&#160;make&#160;out&#160;their shapes. One was&#160;a lobster. The&#160;other was a&#160;<br/>giant humanoid like a Cyclops, but he was surrounded by&#160;a&#160;flurry&#160;of limbs. At first I thought he wearing a&#160;<br/>bunch of&#160;giant octopi. Then I realized they were&#160;his own arms—a hundred flailing, fighting arms.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Briares!&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
I was happy&#160;to see him,&#160;but he looked like he was fighting for his life. He&#160;was the last of his&#160;kind—a&#160;<br/>
Hundred-Handed One, cousin of the Cyclopes. We'd&#160;saved him&#160;from&#160;Kronos's&#160;prison last summer, and I&#160;<br/>knew he'd&#160;come to help Poseidon, but&#160;I&#160;hadn't heard of him&#160;since.&#160;<br/>
&#34;He fights well,&#34; Poseidon&#160;said. &#34;I wish we had a whole army&#160;like him,&#160;but he is the only&#160;one.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I watched&#160;as Briares bellowed in rage and picked&#160;up the lobster, which thrashed and snapped its&#160;<br/>
pincers. He threw it off the coral&#160;mountain, and the&#160;lobster disappeared into the darkness.&#160;Briares swam&#160;<br/>after it, his hundred arms spinning like the blades of a motorboat.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, we may&#160;not have&#160;much time,&#34; my&#160;dad said. &#34;Tell me of your mission. Did&#160;you see Kronos?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I told him&#160;everything, though my&#160;voice choked up when I explained about Beckendorf. I looked down&#160;<br/>
at the courtyards below&#160;and saw hundreds of wounded&#160;mermen&#160;lying on makeshift cots. I&#160;saw rows of&#160;<br/>coral&#160;mounds that must've been hastily&#160;made graves. I realized Beckendorf wasn't&#160;the first death. He was&#160;<br/>only&#160;one of&#160;hundreds, maybe thousands.&#160;I'd never felt so angry&#160;and&#160;helpless.&#160;<br/>
Poseidon stroked his beard.&#160;&#34;Percy,&#160;Beckendorf chose a heroic death. You bear&#160;no blame for that.&#160;<br/>
Kronos's&#160;army will be m&#160;disarray.&#160;Many&#160;were destroyed.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=19></a>&#34;But we didn't kill him,&#160;did we?&#34;&#160;<br/>
As I said it, I&#160;knew it was&#160;a naive hope.&#160;We&#160;might blow&#160;up his ship&#160;and disintegrate his&#160;monsters, but&#160;<br/>
a Titan lord&#160;wouldn't be so easy&#160;to kill.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; Poseidon admitted. &#34;But&#160;you've bought&#160;our side some&#160;time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;There were demigods on&#160;that ship,&#34; I said, thinking&#160;of the&#160;kid I'd&#160;seen in the stairwell. Somehow I'd&#160;<br/>
allowed&#160;myself&#160;to&#160;<br/>
concentrate on the monsters and Kronos. I'd convinced&#160;myself that destroying&#160;<br/>
their ship was all right because they&#160;were evil, they&#160;were sailing to attack my&#160;city, and besides, they&#160;<br/>couldn't really&#160;be permanently&#160;killed. Monsters just vaporized and re-formed eventually. But&#160;demigods . .&#160;<br/>.&#160;<br/>
Poseidon put&#160;his hand on&#160;my&#160;shoulder.&#160;&#34;Percy, there were only&#160;a few demigod warriors aboard that&#160;<br/>
ship, and they all chose to battle for Kronos. Perhaps some&#160;heeded&#160;your warning and escaped. If they&#160;did&#160;<br/>not . .&#160;. they&#160;chose their path.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;They were brainwashed!&#34; I said. &#34;Now they're dead&#160;and Kronos is still alive. That's&#160;supposed to&#160;<br/>
make&#160;me feel&#160;better?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I glared at the&#160;mosaic—little tile explosions destroying tile&#160;monsters. It&#160;seemed so easy&#160;when it was&#160;<br/>
just a picture.&#160;<br/>
Tyson put his&#160;arm&#160;around&#160;me. If anybody&#160;else had tried that, I would've pushed&#160;him&#160;away, but Tyson&#160;<br/>
was too big and stubborn. He hugged&#160;me&#160;whether I&#160;wanted it or not. &#34;Not your fault, brother. Kronos does&#160;<br/>not explode good. Next time we will use&#160;a big stick.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; my&#160;father said. &#34;Beckendorf's sacrifice&#160;wasn't in vain. You have scattered the invasion force.&#160;<br/>
New York will be safe for a time, which&#160;frees the other Olympians&#160;to deal with the bigger threat.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The bigger threat?&#34; I thought about what the golden Titan had&#160;said in&#160;my&#160;dream:&#160;<i>The gods have&#160;</i><br/>
<i>answered the challenge. Soon they will be destroyed.</i>&#160;<br/>
A shadow passed over&#160;my&#160;father's face.&#160;&#34;You've&#160;had enough sorrow for one day.&#160;Ask Chiron when&#160;<br/>
you return&#160;to&#160;camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Return to camp? But you're in trouble&#160;here. I want to help!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can't, Percy.&#160;Your job is elsewhere.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I couldn't believe I was hearing this. I&#160;looked at Tyson for backup.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;brother chewed his lip. &#34;Daddy&#160;. .&#160;.&#160;Percy&#160;can fight with a sword. He is good.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know that,&#34;&#160;Poseidon said gently.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dad, I can help,&#34; I said. &#34;I&#160;know I can.&#160;You're not going to&#160;hold out here much&#160;longer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A fireball launched into&#160;the sky&#160;from&#160;behind the enemy&#160;lines. I thought&#160;Poseidon would deflect it or&#160;<br/>
something, but it landed&#160;on&#160;the&#160;outer corner of the&#160;yard and exploded, sending&#160;mermen tumbling&#160;through&#160;<br/>the water. Poseidon winced as if he'd&#160;just been stabbed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Return to camp,&#34; he insisted. &#34;And tell&#160;Chiron it is time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;For what?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You must hear the prophecy. The&#160;<i>entire&#160;</i>prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a>I didn't need&#160;to ask him&#160;which prophecy. I'd been&#160;hearing about the &#34;Great Prophecy&#34; for years, but&#160;<br/>
nobody&#160;would ever tell me the whole thing. All I&#160;knew&#160;was that I was supposed to make a&#160;decision that&#160;<br/>would decide the fate of the world—but&#160;no pressure.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What if&#160;<i>this&#160;</i>is the decision?&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;Staying&#160;here to&#160;light,&#160;or leaving? What if I&#160;leave and you&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I couldn't say&#160;<i>die.&#160;</i>Gods weren't supposed to die, but&#160;I'd seen it happen. Even if&#160;they&#160;didn't die, they&#160;<br/>
could be reduced to nearly&#160;nothing, exiled, imprisoned in the depths of Tartarus like Kronos had been.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#160;you must go,&#34; Poseidon insisted. &#34;I don't know what your&#160;final decision will be, but your fight&#160;<br/>
lies in the world above. If&#160;nothing else, you must warn your friends at camp. Kronos knew your plans.&#160;<br/>You have a spy.&#160;We will hold&#160;here. We&#160;have no choice.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Tyson gripped my&#160;hand&#160;desperately.&#160;&#34;I&#160;will&#160;miss you, brother!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Watching us, our father seemed to&#160;age&#160;another ten years. &#34;Tyson,&#160;you have work to do as well,&#160;my&#160;<br/>
son. They&#160;need&#160;you in the armory.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Tyson pouted some&#160;more.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will go,&#34;&#160;he sniffled. He hugged me&#160;so hard he&#160;almost cracked my&#160;ribs. &#34;Percy,&#160;be careful! Do not&#160;<br/>
let monsters kill&#160;you&#160;dead!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I tried to nod&#160;confidently,&#160;but it was too&#160;much for&#160;the&#160;big guy. He sobbed and swam&#160;away&#160;toward the&#160;<br/>
armory, where his cousins were fixing spears and swords.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You should let him&#160;fight,&#34; I told my&#160;father. &#34;He hates&#160;being stuck in&#160;the armory. Can't you tell?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Poseidon shook his&#160;head.&#160;&#34;It is bad enough I&#160;must send&#160;you&#160;into&#160;danger. Tyson&#160;is too&#160;young. I must&#160;<br/>
protect him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You should trust him,&#34; I said. &#34;Not try&#160;to&#160;protect him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Poseidon's eyes flared. I thought I'd gone too far,&#160;but then he looked down&#160;at the mosaic&#160;and his&#160;<br/>
shoulders sagged. On the tiles, the&#160;mermaid guy&#160;in&#160;the&#160;crawfish chariot was coming closer to the palace.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oceanus approaches,&#34;&#160;my&#160;father said. &#34;I must&#160;meet him&#160;in battle.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I'd never been scared for a god&#160;before, but I didn't&#160;see how my&#160;dad&#160;could face this Titan and win.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will hold,&#34;&#160;Poseidon promised. &#34;I will not give&#160;up&#160;my&#160;domain. Just tell&#160;me, Percy,&#160;do&#160;you&#160;still have&#160;<br/>
the birthday&#160;gift I gave&#160;you&#160;last summer?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded and pulled out my&#160;camp necklace. It had a&#160;bead for every&#160;summer I'd&#160;been at Camp Half-<br/>
Blood, but since last year&#160;I'd also kept a sand dollar on the cord.&#160;My&#160;father had given it to&#160;me&#160;for&#160;my&#160;<br/>fifteenth birthday.&#160;He'd&#160;told&#160;me&#160;I would know when to&#160;&#34;spend it,&#34; but so far I hadn't figured&#160;out what he&#160;<br/>meant. All I knew was that&#160;it didn't fit the vending machines in the&#160;school cafeteria.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The time is&#160;coming,&#34; he&#160;promised. &#34;With luck, I&#160;will see you&#160;for&#160;your birthday next week, and we&#160;<br/>
will have a<i>&#160;</i>proper celebration.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He smiled, and for a moment I saw the old light in&#160;his eyes.&#160;<br/>
Then the entire sea grew&#160;dark in front&#160;of us,&#160;like an&#160;inky storm&#160;was rolling&#160;in. Thunder&#160;crackled,&#160;<br/>
which should've been impossible underwater. A huge icy<i>&#160;</i>presence was&#160;approaching. I sensed a wave of&#160;<br/>fear roll through the armies below us.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=21></a>&#34;I must assume&#160;my&#160;true godly&#160;form,&#34; Poseidon said.&#160;&#34;Go—and good luck,&#160;my&#160;son.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to encourage him, to&#160;hug&#160;him&#160;or something, but&#160;knew better than to&#160;stick around.&#160;When a&#160;<br/>
god assumes&#160;his true form,&#160;the power is so great that any&#160;mortal looking&#160;on him&#160;will disintegrate.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good-bye, Father,&#34; I managed.&#160;<br/>
Then I turned&#160;away. I willed the ocean currents&#160;to aid me. Water swirled around me, and I shot&#160;<br/>
toward the surface at&#160;speeds that would've&#160;caused any&#160;normal human to pop like&#160;a<i>&#160;</i>balloon.&#160;<br/>
When I looked back, all I could see were&#160;flashes of&#160;green and blue as&#160;my&#160;father&#160;fought the Titan, and&#160;<br/>
the sea itself&#160;was torn apart by&#160;the two armies.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
THREE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;GET &#160;A &#160;SNEAK &#160;PEEK &#160;AT&#160;<br/>
MY &#160;DEATH&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
If you want to&#160;be popular&#160;at Camp&#160;Half-Blood, don't come&#160;back from&#160;a&#160;mission with bad news.&#160;<br/>
Word of my&#160;arrival spread&#160;as soon as I&#160;walked out&#160;of the ocean.&#160;Our beach is&#160;on the North&#160;Shore of&#160;<br/>
Long Island,&#160;and it's enchanted so most people can't&#160;even see it. People don't just&#160;<i>appear&#160;</i>on the beach&#160;<br/>unless they're demigods or gods or really, really&#160;lost pizza delivery&#160;guys.&#160;(It's&#160;happened—but that's&#160;<br/>another story.)&#160;<br/>
Anyway, that afternoon the lookout on&#160;duty&#160;was Connor&#160;Stoll from&#160;the Hermes cabin. When he&#160;<br/>
spotted me, he got so excited he fell out of his tree.&#160;Then he blew the conch horn to signal the camp&#160;and&#160;<br/>ran to greet me.&#160;<br/>
Connor&#160;had a crooked smile that&#160;matched his crooked&#160;sense of humor. He's a pretty nice guy,&#160;but&#160;you&#160;<br/>
should always keep one hand on&#160;your wallet when he's around, and do&#160;not,&#160;under any&#160;circumstances, give&#160;<br/>him&#160;access to&#160;shaving cream&#160;unless you want to find&#160;your sleeping bag full&#160;of&#160;it. He's got curly&#160;brown&#160;<br/>hair and is&#160;a&#160;little shorter than his brother, Travis,&#160;which is the only&#160;way&#160;I can&#160;tell them apart. They&#160;are&#160;<br/>both so&#160;unlike&#160;my&#160;old&#160;enemy&#160;Luke it's&#160;hard&#160;to believe they're all sons of Hermes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; he&#160;yelled. &#34;What happened? Where's Beckendorf?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Then he saw my&#160;expression, and his smile melted. &#34;Oh, no.<i>&#160;</i>Poor&#160;Silena. Holy&#160;Zeus, when she finds&#160;<br/>
out . .&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Together we climbed the sand dunes.&#160;A few hundred&#160;yards away,&#160;people were already&#160;streaming&#160;<br/>
toward us, smiling and excited.&#160;<i>Percy's&#160;back,&#160;</i>they&#160;were probably&#160;thinking.&#160;<i>He's saved the day!&#160;Maybe he&#160;</i><br/>
<i>brought&#160;souvenirs!</i>&#160;<br/>
I stopped at the dining pavilion and waited for them.&#160;No sense rushing down there to tell them what&#160;a&#160;<br/>
loser I was.&#160;<br/>
I gazed&#160;across the valley&#160;and tried to remember how&#160;Camp&#160;Half-Blood looked the first time I&#160;ever&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=22></a>saw it. That seemed like a bajillion&#160;years ago.&#160;<br/>
From&#160;the dining pavilion,&#160;you could see pretty&#160;much everything. Hills ringed the valley. On the&#160;<br/>
tallest, Half-Blood Hill,&#160;Thalia's pine tree stood&#160;with the Golden Fleece hanging from&#160;its branches,&#160;<br/>magically&#160;protecting the camp from&#160;its enemies. The&#160;guard dragon&#160;Peleus was so&#160;big now I could see him&#160;<br/>from&#160;here—curled around&#160;the tree trunk,&#160;lending&#160;up smoke signals&#160;as he snored.&#160;<br/>
To my&#160;right spread the woods. To my&#160;left, the canoe lake glittered&#160;and the climbing wall glowed from&#160;<br/>
the lava pouring down its&#160;side. Twelve&#160;cabins—one&#160;for each Olympian god—made a horseshoe pattern&#160;<br/>around the commons area. Farther south were the strawberry&#160;fields, the armory, and the four-story&#160;Big&#160;<br/>House with its sky&#160;blue paint job and its&#160;bronze eagle weathervane.&#160;<br/>
In some ways, the camp&#160;hadn't changed.&#160;But you couldn't see the&#160;war by&#160;looking at the buildings or&#160;<br/>
the fields. You could see it&#160;in the faces of the demigods and satyrs and naiads coming up the hill.&#160;<br/>
There weren't&#160;as&#160;many&#160;at camp&#160;as four summers&#160;ago.&#160;Some had left and&#160;never come back. Some had&#160;<br/>
died fighting.&#160;Others—we&#160;tried not to&#160;talk about&#160;them—had gone over to the enemy.&#160;<br/>
The ones who were still here were&#160;battle-hardened and weary.&#160;There was little laughter at camp these&#160;<br/>
days. Even the Hermes cabin didn't play&#160;so many&#160;pranks. It's&#160;hard to enjoy&#160;practical jokes when your&#160;<br/>whole life feels like one.&#160;<br/>
Chiron galloped into the pavilion first,&#160;which was&#160;easy&#160;for him&#160;since he's a white stallion from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
waist down. His beard had&#160;grown wilder over the summer. He&#160;wore a green T-shirt that said MY OTHER&#160;<br/>CAR IS A CENTAUR&#160;and a bow slung over his back.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; he said. &#34;Thank the gods. But&#160;where . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth ran in right behind him,&#160;and I'll admit&#160;my&#160;heart did a little relay&#160;race in my&#160;chest&#160;when I&#160;<br/>
saw her. It's&#160;not that she tried to look&#160;good. We'd&#160;been doing so&#160;many&#160;combat&#160;missions lately, she hardly&#160;<br/>brushed her&#160;curly blond&#160;hair anymore, and she didn't care what&#160;clothes she was wearing—usually&#160;the&#160;<br/>same old orange camp&#160;T-shirt and jeans, and once in a while her bronze armor. Her eyes&#160;were stormy&#160;<br/>gray. Most of&#160;the time&#160;we&#160;couldn't get through a conversation without trying to strangle&#160;each&#160;other. Still,&#160;<br/>just seeing her&#160;made&#160;me feel fuzzy&#160;in the head. Last&#160;summer, before Luke had turned into&#160;Kronos and&#160;<br/>everything went sour, there had been a&#160;few times when&#160;I thought&#160;maybe . . . well, that we might&#160;get past&#160;<br/>the strangle-each-other phase.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What happened?&#34; She grabbed my&#160;arm.&#160;&#34;Is Luke—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;The ship blew&#160;up,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;He wasn't&#160;destroyed.&#160;I don't know where—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena Beauregard pushed&#160;through the&#160;crowd. Her hair wasn't combed and she wasn't even&#160;wearing&#160;<br/>
makeup, which wasn't&#160;like her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Where's Charlie?&#34; she demanded, looking around like he might be hiding.&#160;<br/>
I glanced at Chiron&#160;helplessly.&#160;<br/>The old centaur cleared his throat. &#34;Silena,&#160;my&#160;dear, let's talk about this at the Big House—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; she muttered. &#34;No.&#160;<i>No.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
She started to cry,&#160;and the rest of us stood around, too stunned to&#160;speak. We'd&#160;already&#160;lost&#160;so many&#160;<br/>
people over the summer, but this was the worst. With&#160;Beckendorf&#160;gone, it felt like someone had stolen the&#160;<br/>anchor for the entire camp.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=23></a>Finally&#160;Clarisse from the&#160;Ares&#160;cabin came forward.&#160;She put&#160;her arm&#160;around Silena. They&#160;had one of&#160;<br/>
the strangest&#160;friendships ever—a daughter of the&#160;war god and a daughter of the love goddess—but ever&#160;<br/>since Silena had given Clarisse&#160;advice last summer&#160;about&#160;her first boyfriend,&#160;Clarisse had decided she&#160;<br/>was Silena's personal bodyguard.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse&#160;was&#160;dressed in her bloodred combat armor,&#160;her brown&#160;hair tucked into&#160;a bandana. She was as&#160;<br/>
big and&#160;beefy as a rugby&#160;player, with a permanent scowl on her face, but she spoke gently&#160;to Silena.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come on, girl,&#34; she said. &#34;Let's&#160;get to the Big House. I'll&#160;make you some&#160;hot chocolate.&#34;&#160;<br/>Everyone turned and wandered off in&#160;twos and threes, heading back to&#160;the&#160;cabins. Nobody&#160;was&#160;<br/>
excited to see me now. Nobody wanted to hear about&#160;the blown-up&#160;ship.&#160;<br/>
Only Annabeth and Chiron&#160;stayed behind.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth wiped a tear from&#160;her cheek. &#34;I'm&#160;glad you're not dead, Seaweed Brain.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks,&#34; I said. &#34;Me too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron put a hand on my&#160;shoulder. &#34;I'm sure you did everything you could, Percy.&#160;Will you tell us&#160;<br/>
what happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't want&#160;to go&#160;through&#160;it again,&#160;but&#160;I told&#160;them&#160;the story, including&#160;my&#160;dream&#160;about the&#160;Titans. I&#160;<br/>
left out the&#160;detail about Nico. Nico had&#160;made&#160;me promise not to tell anybody&#160;about his&#160;plan until I made&#160;<br/>up my&#160;mind, and the plan&#160;was so scary&#160;I didn't mind keeping it a secret.&#160;<br/>
Chiron gazed down at the&#160;valley.&#160;&#34;We must call a war council immediately,&#160;to discuss this spy,&#160;and&#160;<br/>
other matters.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Poseidon mentioned another threat,&#34; I said. &#34;Something even bigger than the&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda.&#160;</i>I&#160;<br/>
thought it might be that challenge the Titan had mentioned in my&#160;dream.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron and Annabeth exchanged looks, like they&#160;knew something I didn't. I hated when they&#160;did that.&#160;<br/>&#34;We will discuss that also,&#34; Chiron promised.&#160;<br/>
&#34;One&#160;more thing.&#34; I took a deep breath. &#34;When I talked to my&#160;father, he said to tell you it's time. I&#160;<br/>
need to know the full prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron's shoulders sagged, but he didn't look surprised. &#34;I've dreaded this day.&#160;Very&#160;well. Annabeth,&#160;<br/>
we will show Percy&#160;the truth—all of&#160;<i>it.&#160;</i>Let's go to the attic.&#34;&#160;<br/>
* * *&#160;<br/>
I’d&#160;been to the Big House attic three times before, which was three&#160;times&#160;more than I wanted to.&#160;<br/>
A ladder led<i>&#160;</i>up from&#160;the top of<i>&#160;</i>the staircase.&#160;I wondered how Chiron was going to get up there, being&#160;<br/>
half horse and all, but&#160;he didn't try.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know where it is,&#34; he told Annabeth. &#34;Bring it down, please.&#34;&#160;<br/>Annabeth nodded. &#34;Come&#160;on, Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>The sun was&#160;setting outside, so the&#160;attic was even darker and creepier than usual. Old hero trophies&#160;<br/>
were&#160;slacked&#160;everywhere—dented shields, pickled heads in jars&#160;from various monsters, a pair of fuzzy&#160;<br/>dice on a bronze plaque that read: STOLEN FROM&#160;CHRYSAOR'S&#160;HONDA&#160;CIVIC, BY&#160;GUS, SON&#160;OF&#160;<br/>HERMES, 1988.&#160;<br/>
I picked up a curved bronze sword so&#160;badly&#160;bent it looked like the letter&#160;<i>M.&#160;</i>I could still see green&#160;<br/>
stains on the&#160;metal from&#160;the&#160;magical poison that&#160;used to&#160;cover it. The tag was dated last summer. It read:&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a><i>Scimitar of Kampê, destroyed in&#160;the Battle of the Labyrinth.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;You remember Briares throwing those boulders?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>Annabeth gave&#160;me&#160;a grudging smile. &#34;And&#160;Grover causing a Panic?&#34;&#160;<br/>We locked eyes. I&#160;thought&#160;of a&#160;different time last summer, under&#160;Mount&#160;St. Helens, when Annabeth&#160;<br/>
thought I was going to&#160;die&#160;and she kissed me.&#160;<br/>
She cleared her throat and looked away.&#160;&#34;Prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Right.&#34; I&#160;put&#160;down the scimitar. &#34;Prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We walked over to the window. On a three-legged&#160;stool sat the Oracle—a shriveled female&#160;mummy&#160;<br/>
m&#160;a tie-dyed&#160;dress. Tufts of black hair clung to&#160;her skull. Glassy&#160;eyes stared out of her leathery face. Just&#160;<br/>looking&#160;at her&#160;made&#160;my&#160;skin crawl.&#160;<br/>
If you wanted to leave&#160;camp during the summer, it&#160;used to be you had to come&#160;up here to get&#160;a quest.&#160;<br/>
This summer,&#160;that rule&#160;had been&#160;tossed.&#160;Campers left all the time on combat missions. We had no choice&#160;<br/>if we wanted&#160;to stop Kronos.&#160;<br/>
Still, I remembered too well the strange green&#160;mist—the spirit&#160;of the Oracle—that lived inside the&#160;<br/>
mummy.&#160;She looked lifeless now, but whenever she spoke a prophecy, she moved. Sometimes fog gushed&#160;<br/>out of&#160;her mouth and created strange shapes. Once, she'd even left the attic and&#160;taken a little&#160;zombie stroll&#160;<br/>into the woods to deliver a&#160;message.&#160;I wasn't&#160;sure what she'd do for the &#34;Great Prophecy.&#34; I&#160;half expected&#160;<br/>her to start tap dancing&#160;or&#160;something.&#160;<br/>
But she just sat there like she was dead—which she was.&#160;<br/>&#34;I never understood this,&#34; I&#160;whispered.&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why&#160;it's a&#160;mummy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, she didn't used to&#160;be a&#160;mummy.&#160;For thousands&#160;of years the&#160;spirit of the&#160;Oracle&#160;lived inside&#160;a&#160;<br/>
beautiful maiden. The spirit would be passed on from&#160;generation to&#160;generation. Chiron told me&#160;<i>she&#160;</i>was&#160;<br/>like that fifty&#160;years ago.&#34; Annabeth pointed at the mummy.&#160;&#34;But she was the last.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth started to say&#160;something, then apparently&#160;changed her&#160;mind. &#34;Let's&#160;just do our job and get&#160;<br/>
out of&#160;here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked&#160;nervously&#160;at the Oracle's&#160;withered face. &#34;So what now?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth approached the&#160;mummy&#160;and&#160;held out her palms. &#34;O&#160;Oracle, the&#160;time&#160;is at&#160;hand. I&#160;ask for&#160;<br/>
the Great Prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I braced&#160;myself, but the mummy&#160;didn't move. Instead,&#160;Annabeth&#160;approached and unclasped one of its&#160;<br/>
necklaces.&#160;I’d never paid too much attention to its jewelry&#160;before. I figured it was just hippie love beads&#160;<br/>and stuff. But when Annabeth turned toward&#160;me, she was holding a leather pouch—like a Native&#160;<br/>American&#160;medicine pouch&#160;on a cord braided with feathers. She opened the bag and took&#160;out a roll of&#160;<br/>parchment no bigger than&#160;her pinky.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No way,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;You mean all these years, I've&#160;been asking about this&#160;stupid prophecy,&#160;and it's&#160;<br/>
been right there around her&#160;neck?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The time&#160;wasn't&#160;right,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Believe&#160;me,&#160;Percy,&#160;I read&#160;this when I&#160;was ten years&#160;old, and&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=25></a>I still have nightmares about it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Great,&#34; I said. &#34;Can I read it now?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Downstairs&#160;at the war council,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Not in&#160;front&#160;of .&#160;. . you&#160;know.&#34;&#160;<br/>I looked at the glassy&#160;eyes of the Oracle,&#160;and I decided not to argue. We headed&#160;downstairs to join the&#160;<br/>
others. I didn't know it<i>&#160;</i>then, but it&#160;would be the last time I ever visited the attic.&#160;<br/>
* * *&#160;<br/>
The senior counselors had&#160;gathered around the Ping-Pong table. Don't ask&#160;me why,&#160;but the rec room&#160;had&#160;<br/>become&#160;the&#160;camp's&#160;informal headquarters for&#160;war&#160;councils. When Annabeth, Chiron, and I came in,&#160;<br/>though, it looked more like a shouting&#160;match.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse was&#160;still in full battle gear. Her&#160;electric&#160;spear&#160;was&#160;strapped to her back. (Actually, her&#160;<i>second&#160;</i><br/>
electric&#160;spear, since I'd broken the first one. She called the spear&#160;&#34;Maimer.&#34; Behind her back, everybody&#160;<br/>else called it &#34;Lamer.&#34;) She had her boar-shaped helmet under one arm&#160;and a knife at her belt.&#160;<br/>
She was in the&#160;midst of yelling at Michael Yew,&#160;the new head counselor for Apollo, which looked&#160;<br/>
kind of funny&#160;since Clarisse was&#160;a foot taller. Michael&#160;had taken over the&#160;Apollo cabin after Lee Fletcher&#160;<br/>died in battle&#160;last summer.&#160;Michael stood four feet six, with another two feet of attitude. He reminded&#160;me&#160;<br/>of a ferret, with a pointy&#160;nose and scrunched-up features—either because&#160;he scowled so&#160;much&#160;or because&#160;<br/>he spent too&#160;much time&#160;looking&#160;down the shaft of an arrow.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's&#160;<i>our&#160;</i>loot!&#34; he yelled, standing on&#160;his&#160;tiptoes so he could get in&#160;Clarisse's&#160;face. &#34;If you don't like it,&#160;<br/>
you can kiss&#160;my&#160;quiver!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Around the table, people were trying&#160;not to laugh—the Stoll brothers, Pollux from&#160;the&#160;Dionysus&#160;<br/>
cabin, Katie Gardner from Demeter.&#160;Even Jake&#160;Mason, the hastily&#160;appointed new counselor from&#160;<br/>Hephaestus,&#160;managed a&#160;faint smile.&#160;Only&#160;Silena Beauregard didn't pay&#160;any attention. She sat beside&#160;<br/>Clarisse and stared vacantly&#160;at the Ping-Pong net. Her eyes were red and puffy.&#160;A cup of hot&#160;chocolate sat&#160;<br/>untouched in&#160;front of her. It&#160;seemed unfair that she had to be here. I&#160;couldn't believe Clarisse and Michael&#160;<br/>standing over her, arguing&#160;about something as stupid&#160;as loot, when&#160;she'd just lost Beckendorf.&#160;<br/>
&#34;STOP IT!&#34; I&#160;yelled. &#34;What are you guys&#160;doing?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Clarisse&#160;glowered at&#160;me. &#34;Tell Michael&#160;not to&#160;be a selfish jerk.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, that's perfect, coming from&#160;you,&#34; Michael said.&#160;<br/>&#34;The only&#160;reason I'm here&#160;is to support Silena!&#34;&#160;Clarisse&#160;shouted. &#34;Otherwise I'd be back in my&#160;<br/>
cabin.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What are you talking&#160;about?&#34; I&#160;demanded.&#160;<br/>Pollux cleared his throat. &#34;Clarisse&#160;has refused to speak to any&#160;of&#160;us, until&#160;her, um, issue is resolved.&#160;<br/>
She hasn't spoken for three days.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's been wonderful,&#34; Travis Stoll said&#160;wistfully.&#160;<br/>&#34;What issue?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>Clarisse turned to Chiron. &#34;You're in charge,&#160;right? Does&#160;my&#160;cabin get what we want or not?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron shuffled his hooves. &#34;My&#160;dear, as I've already&#160;explained,&#160;Michael is correct. Apollo's&#160;cabin&#160;<br/>
has the best claim.&#160;Besides,&#160;we have&#160;more important matters—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sure,&#34; Clarisse snapped. &#34;Always&#160;more important&#160;matters than what Ares needs. We're just supposed&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=26></a>to show up&#160;and light when&#160;you&#160;need us,&#160;and not complain!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That would&#160;be nice,&#34; Connor Stoll&#160;muttered.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse gripped her knife.&#160;&#34;Maybe I should ask Mr. D—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;As you know,&#34; Chiron interrupted, his tone slightly&#160;angry&#160;now, &#34;our director, Dionysus, is busy&#160;with&#160;<br/>
the war. He can't be bothered with this.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I see,&#34; Clarisse said. &#34;And the senior counselors? Are&#160;<i>any&#160;</i>of you going&#160;to&#160;side with&#160;me?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nobody&#160;was&#160;smiling now.&#160;None of them met Clarisse's eyes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Fine.&#34; Clarisse turned to&#160;Silena. &#34;I'm&#160;sorry.&#160;I&#160;didn't&#160;mean to get into this when&#160;you've just lost . .&#160;.&#160;<br/>
Anyway, I apologize. To&#160;<i>you.&#160;</i>Nobody&#160;else.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena didn't seem to register her words.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse threw her knife on the Ping-Pong table.&#160;&#34;All of&#160;you can fight this war without Ares. Until&#160;I&#160;<br/>
get satisfaction, no one in&#160;my&#160;cabin is&#160;lifting a finger&#160;to help. Have fun dying.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The counselors were&#160;all too stunned to&#160;say&#160;anything&#160;as Clarisse stormed out of the room.&#160;<br/>Finally&#160;Michael Yew said, &#34;Good riddance.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you kidding?&#34; Katie Gardner protested. &#34;This is a disaster!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;She can't be&#160;serious,&#34; Travis said. &#34;Can she?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron sighed. &#34;Her pride has been wounded. She'll calm down eventually.&#34;&#160;But he didn't&#160;sound&#160;<br/>
convinced.&#160;<br/>
I wanted to ask what the heck Clarisse&#160;was&#160;so&#160;mad about, but I looked at Annabeth and she&#160;mouthed&#160;<br/>
the words&#160;<i>I'll&#160;tell you later.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Now,&#34; Chiron continued,&#160;&#34;if you please, counselors.&#160;Percy&#160;has brought something I think&#160;you should&#160;<br/>
hear. Percy—the Great Prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth handed me&#160;the parchment. It felt dry&#160;and&#160;old, and my&#160;fingers fumbled with the&#160;string. I&#160;<br/>
uncurled the&#160;paper, trying&#160;not to rip it, and began to&#160;read:&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;A half-blood&#160;of the eldest dogs . .&#160;.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Er, Percy?&#34;&#160;Annabeth interrupted. &#160;&#34;That's&#160;<i>gods.&#160;</i>Not&#160;<i>dogs</i>.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, right,&#34; I said. Being dyslexic is one&#160;mark of&#160;a demigod, but sometimes I really&#160;hate it. The&#160;more&#160;<br/>
nervous I am, the worse&#160;my&#160;reading gets.&#160;<i>&#34;A half~blood of the eldest gods . . . shall reach sixteen against&#160;</i><br/>
<i>all odds . . .&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
I hesitated, staring at the next lines. A cold feeling started&#160;m&#160;my&#160;fingers as if the paper was freezing.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;And see the world in endless sleep,</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>The hero's&#160;soul, cursed blade shall reap.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
Suddenly&#160;Riptide seemed heavier in my&#160;pocket. A&#160;cursed blade? Chiron&#160;once told me&#160;Riptide had&#160;<br/>
brought many&#160;people sorrow. Was it possible&#160;my&#160;own sword could get me&#160;killed? And how could the&#160;<br/>world fall into endless sleep, unless that&#160;meant death?&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Chiron urged. &#34;Read the rest.&#34;&#160;<br/>My&#160;mouth felt&#160;like it was full of sand,&#160;but I spoke the last two lines.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;A single choice shall. . . shall end&#160;his days.</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Olympus to per</i>—<i>pursue</i>—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=27></a><i>&#34;Preserve,&#34;&#160;</i>Annabeth said gently.&#160;&#34;It&#160;means&#160;<i>to save.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know what&#160;it means,&#34; I grumbled.&#160;<i>&#34;Olympus to preserve or raze.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
The room&#160;was silent. Finally Connor Stoll said, &#34;Raise is good, isn't it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not&#160;<i>raise,</i>&#34;<i>&#160;</i>Silena said. Her voice was hollow,&#160;but I was startled to&#160;hear her speak at all. &#34;R-a-z-e&#160;<br/>
means&#160;<i>destroy.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Obliterate,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Annihilate. Turn to rubble.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Got it.&#34; My&#160;heart felt like lead. &#34;Thanks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Everybody was looking at&#160;me—with concern, or pity, or maybe a little fear.&#160;<br/>Chiron closed his eyes as&#160;if he were&#160;saying a prayer.&#160;In horse form, his head&#160;almost brushed the lights&#160;<br/>
in the rec room. &#34;You see&#160;now, Percy,&#160;why we thought it&#160;best not to tell&#160;you the whole prophecy. You've&#160;<br/>had enough on&#160;your shoulders—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Without&#160;realizing I was going to&#160;die in&#160;the end anyway?&#34; I said. &#34;Yeah, I get it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron gazed at&#160;me sadly. The guy&#160;was three thousand&#160;years old. He'd&#160;seen hundreds of heroes die.&#160;<br/>
He&#160;might not&#160;like it, but he&#160;was used to it. He&#160;probably knew better than&#160;to try to reassure&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;You know prophecies always&#160;have double meanings. It might not&#160;literally&#160;<br/>
mean you&#160;die.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sure,&#34; I said.&#160;<i>&#34;A single choice shall end his days.&#160;</i>That&#160;has tons of&#160;meanings, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maybe we can stop it,&#34; Jake Mason offered.&#160;<i>&#34;The hero's&#160;soul, cursed blade shall reap.&#160;</i>Maybe we&#160;<br/>
could find&#160;this&#160;cursed blade and destroy&#160;it. Sounds like Kronos's&#160;scythe, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I hadn't thought about that, but it&#160;didn't&#160;matter if the cursed blade was Riptide or Kronos's&#160;scythe.&#160;<br/>
Either way,&#160;I&#160;doubted we&#160;could stop the prophecy.&#160;A blade was&#160;supposed to reap&#160;my&#160;soul.&#160;As a general&#160;<br/>rule, I preferred not to&#160;have&#160;my&#160;soul reaped.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Perhaps we&#160;should let Percy&#160;think about&#160;these lines,&#34; Chiron said.&#160;&#34;He needs time—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;No.&#34; I folded&#160;up the prophecy&#160;and shoved it into&#160;my&#160;pocket. I felt defiant and&#160;angry,&#160;though I wasn't&#160;<br/>
sure who I was angry&#160;with. &#34;I don't need time. If I die,<i>&#160;</i>I die. I can't worry about&#160;that, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth's&#160;hands were shaking a little.&#160;She wouldn't meet&#160;my&#160;eyes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Let's&#160;move on,&#34; I said. &#34;We've got other problems. We've got a spy.&#34;&#160;<br/>Michael Yew&#160;scowled. &#34;A spy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I told them&#160;what had happened on the&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda</i>—how Kronos had known we were&#160;<br/>
coming, how&#160;he'd&#160;shown&#160;me the silver scythe pendant&#160;he'd used to communicate&#160;with someone at camp.&#160;<br/>
Silena started&#160;to cry&#160;again,&#160;and Annabeth&#160;put an arm&#160;around&#160;her shoulders.&#160;<br/>&#34;Well,&#34; Connor Stoll&#160;said uncomfortably, &#34;we've&#160;suspected there&#160;might a spy&#160;for&#160;years, right?&#160;<br/>
Somebody&#160;kept passing information to&#160;Luke—like the&#160;location&#160;of the Golden&#160;Fleece a couple of&#160;years&#160;<br/>ago. It must be somebody&#160;who knew him&#160;well.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Maybe subconsciously, he&#160;glanced at Annabeth. She'd known Luke&#160;better than&#160;anyone, of&#160;course, but&#160;<br/>
Connor looked away&#160;quickly. &#34;Um,&#160;I&#160;mean, it could&#160;be&#160;anybody.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes.&#34; Katie&#160;Gardner frowned at the Stoll brothers.&#160;She'd disliked them&#160;ever&#160;since they'd decorated&#160;<br/>
the grass roof of the Demeter cabin with chocolate Easter bunnies. &#34;Like one of Luke's&#160;siblings.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Travis and Connor&#160;both started arguing&#160;with her.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=28></a>&#34;Stop!&#34; Silena banged the table so hard her hot chocolate spilled. &#34;Charlie's&#160;dead and . . . and&#160;you're&#160;<br/>
all arguing like little kids!&#34;&#160;She put&#160;her&#160;head down and&#160;began to sob.&#160;<br/>
Hot chocolate trickled off the Ping-Pong&#160;table. Everybody&#160;looked ashamed.&#160;<br/>&#34;She's right,&#34; Pollux said&#160;at last. &#34;Accusing each other doesn't help. We need&#160;to keep our eyes open&#160;<br/>
for a silver necklace with a&#160;scythe charm.&#160;If Kronos had one, the spy probably does too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Michael Yew grunted. &#34;We need to find&#160;this spy before we plan&#160;our next&#160;operation. Blowing up&#160;the&#160;<br/>
<i>Princess Andromeda&#160;</i>won't stop Kronos&#160;forever.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No indeed,&#34;&#160;Chiron said. &#34;In fact his next assault is already&#160;on the&#160;way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I scowled. &#34;You mean the&#160;'bigger threat'&#160;Poseidon mentioned?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He and Annabeth looked at each other like,&#160;<i>It's time.&#160;</i>Did I mention I hate it when they&#160;do that?&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Chiron said, &#34;we&#160;didn't want to&#160;tell you until&#160;you returned to camp. You needed a break with&#160;<br/>
your .&#160;. . mortal friends.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth blushed. It dawned on me&#160;that she knew&#160;I'd been hanging&#160;out with&#160;Rachel, and I&#160;felt guilty.&#160;<br/>
Then I felt angry&#160;that I felt&#160;guilty.&#160;I was allowed to&#160;have friends outside camp, right? It wasn't&#160;like . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tell me what's&#160;happened,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Chiron&#160;picked up a bronze goblet from&#160;the snack table. He tossed water onto the hot&#160;plate where we&#160;<br/>
usually&#160;melted nacho cheese. Steam billowed up,&#160;making a rainbow in the fluorescent lights. Chiron&#160;<br/>fished a golden drachma&#160;out of his pouch, tossed it through the&#160;mist, and&#160;muttered, &#34;O Iris,&#160;Goddess of&#160;<br/>the Rainbow,&#160;show us the threat.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The&#160;mist&#160;shimmered. I saw the&#160;familiar image of&#160;a smoldering&#160;volcano—Mount St. Helens. As I&#160;<br/>
watched, the side of the&#160;mountain exploded. Fire,&#160;ash, and lava&#160;rolled out. A newscaster's&#160;voice was&#160;<br/>saying&#160;<i>&#34;</i>—<i>even larger than&#160;last year's eruption,&#160;and&#160;geologists warn that the mountain may&#160;not be done.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
I knew all about last&#160;year's&#160;eruption. I'd&#160;caused it. But this explosion was&#160;much&#160;worse. The&#160;mountain&#160;<br/>
tore itself apart, collapsing inward, and an enormous&#160;form rose out of the smoke&#160;and lava like it was&#160;<br/>emerging from a&#160;manhole. I hoped the Mist would keep&#160;the humans from&#160;seeing&#160;it clearly, because what&#160;I&#160;<br/>saw would've&#160;caused panic and riots across the entire United States.&#160;<br/>
The giant was bigger than&#160;anything I'd ever encountered. Even my&#160;demigod eyes&#160;couldn't&#160;make&#160;out its&#160;<br/>
exact form&#160;through the ash and fire,&#160;but it&#160;was vaguely humanoid and so&#160;huge it&#160;could've used the&#160;<br/>Chrysler Building as a baseball bat. The&#160;mountain shook&#160;with a horrible rumbling, as if the&#160;monster were&#160;<br/>laughing.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's him,&#34; I said. &#34;Typhon.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was&#160;seriously&#160;hoping Chiron would say&#160;something good, like&#160;<i>No, that's our huge friend Leroy! He's&#160;</i><br/>
<i>going&#160;to help&#160;us!&#160;</i>But&#160;no such luck. He simply&#160;nodded. &#34;The most horrible monster of all, the biggest&#160;<br/>single threat&#160;the gods ever faced. He has been&#160;freed&#160;from&#160;under the&#160;mountain at last.&#160;But this scene is&#160;<br/>from&#160;two days ago.&#160;<i>Here&#160;</i>is what is happening today.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron waved his hand and the image changed. I&#160;saw a bank&#160;of storm&#160;clouds rolling across the&#160;<br/>
Midwest plains. Lightning&#160;flickered. Lines of tornadoes destroyed&#160;everything in&#160;their path—ripping up&#160;<br/>houses and trailers, tossing cars around like Matchbox toys.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Monumental floods,&#34;&#160;</i>an&#160;announcer was saying.&#160;<i>&#34;Five states declared disaster areas as the freak&#160;</i><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=29></a><i>storm system&#160;sweeps east,&#160;continuing its path&#160;of destruction.&#34;&#160;</i>The cameras zoomed in on a column&#160;of&#160;<br/>storm&#160;bearing down&#160;on some Midwest city. I couldn't tell which one. Inside&#160;the storm&#160;I&#160;could see the&#160;<br/>giant—just small glimpses of his true form: a&#160;smoky arm,&#160;a dark&#160;clawed hand the size of a city&#160;block. His&#160;<br/>angry&#160;roar rolled across the plains like&#160;a nuclear blast. Other smaller forms darted through the clouds,&#160;<br/>circling the monster. I saw flashes of light, and I realized<i>&#160;</i>the giant&#160;was trying to&#160;swat them. I squinted and&#160;<br/>thought I saw a golden chariot flying into the blackness. Then&#160;some&#160;kind of&#160;huge bird—a&#160;monstrous&#160;<br/>owl—dived in&#160;to attack the giant.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are those . . . the gods?&#34; I&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, Percy,&#34;&#160;Chiron&#160;said.&#160;&#34;They have&#160;been fighting&#160;him&#160;for days&#160;now, trying to&#160;slow him&#160;down. But&#160;<br/>
Typhon is marching forward—toward New York. Toward Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I let that sink&#160;in. &#34;How long until&#160;he gets&#160;here?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Unless the gods can stop him?&#160;Perhaps five days. Most of the Olympians are there . . . except your&#160;<br/>
father, who has a war of his own to fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But then who's guarding&#160;Olympus?&#34;&#160;<br/>Connor Stoll&#160;shook&#160;his head. &#34;If Typhon&#160;gets to New York, it won't matter who's guarding Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought about Kronos's&#160;words on the ship:&#160;<i>I would love to see the&#160;terror in your eyes when you&#160;</i><br/>
<i>realize how I will destroy Olympus.</i>&#160;<br/>
Was this what he was talking about: an&#160;attack by&#160;Typhon? It was sure terrifying enough. But Kronos&#160;<br/>
was always&#160;fooling<i>&#160;</i>us, misdirecting<i>&#160;</i>our attention. This seemed too obvious for him.&#160;And in my&#160;dream,&#160;<br/>the golden Titan had talked about several&#160;more challenges to come, as if Typhon&#160;were only&#160;the first.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's a trick,&#34; I said. &#34;We have to warn the gods. Something else is going&#160;to happen.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron looked at me gravely. &#34;Something worse than Typhon? I hope not.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to&#160;defend Olympus,&#34; I insisted. &#34;Kronos&#160;has another attack planned.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He did,&#34; Travis Stoll reminded me. &#34;But&#160;you sunk&#160;his ship.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Everyone was looking at&#160;me. They&#160;wanted some&#160;good news. They&#160;wanted to&#160;believe that at least I'd&#160;<br/>
given them&#160;a&#160;little bit of&#160;hope.&#160;<br/>
I glanced at Annabeth. I could tell we&#160;were&#160;thinking the same&#160;thing: What if the<i>&#160;Princess Andromeda&#160;</i><br/>
was a ploy?&#160;What if Kronos&#160;<i>let&#160;</i>us blow&#160;up that ship&#160;so&#160;we'd<i>&#160;</i>lower our&#160;guard?&#160;<br/>
But I wasn't going to say that in front&#160;of&#160;Silena.&#160;Her boyfriend had&#160;sacrificed himself for that&#160;mission.&#160;<br/>&#34;Maybe&#160;you're right,&#34; I said, though&#160;I didn't believe it.&#160;<br/>
I tried to imagine how things could get&#160;much&#160;worse. The gods were&#160;m the Midwest&#160;fighting&#160;a huge&#160;<br/>
monster that had almost defeated them&#160;once before.&#160;Poseidon was under siege&#160;and losing&#160;a&#160;war against&#160;<br/>the sea Titan&#160;Oceanus. Kronos was still out there somewhere. Olympus was virtually&#160;undefended. The&#160;<br/>demigods of&#160;Camp&#160;Half-Blood were on&#160;our own with&#160;a spy&#160;in our&#160;midst.&#160;<br/>
Oh, and according to the ancient prophecy, I was going to&#160;die when I turned sixteen—which&#160;<br/>
happened to&#160;be in five<i>&#160;</i>days, the exact same time Typhon was supposed to hit&#160;New&#160;York. Almost forgot&#160;<br/>that.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well,&#34; Chiron&#160;said, &#34;I think that's&#160;enough for one night.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He waved his hand and&#160;the steam&#160;dissipated. The&#160;stormy&#160;battle of Typhon and the gods disappeared.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=30></a>&#34;That's an understatement,&#34; I muttered.&#160;<br/>And the war council adjourned.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
FOUR&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
WE &#160;BURN &#160;A &#160;METAL&#160;<br/>
SHROUD&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I dreamed Rachel Elizabeth Dare was throwing darts&#160;at&#160;my&#160;picture.&#160;<br/>
She was standing in&#160;her room&#160;. . . Okay, back up. I&#160;have to explain that Rachel doesn't&#160;have a room.&#160;<br/>
She has the top floor of her family's&#160;mansion, which is a renovated brownstone&#160;in Brooklyn. Her &#34;room&#34;&#160;<br/>is a huge loft with industrial lighting and floor-to-ceiling windows. It's&#160;about twice as big as&#160;my&#160;mom's&#160;<br/>apartment.&#160;<br/>
Some alt rock was blaring from&#160;her&#160;paint-covered Bose docking system.&#160;As far&#160;as I&#160;could tell,&#160;<br/>
Rachel's&#160;only rule about music was that&#160;no two songs&#160;on her iPod&#160;could<i>&#160;</i>sound the same, and they&#160;all had&#160;<br/>to be strange.&#160;<br/>
She wore a kimono, and her hair was frizzy, like she'd been sleeping. Her bed was&#160;messed up. Sheets&#160;<br/>
hung&#160;over a&#160;bunch&#160;of artist's easels. Dirty clothes and old&#160;energy&#160;bar wrappers were strewn around&#160;the&#160;<br/>floor, but when you've got a room&#160;that&#160;big, the mess doesn't&#160;look so bad. Out the windows&#160;you could see&#160;<br/>the entire nighttime&#160;skyline of Manhattan.&#160;<br/>
The picture she was attacking was a painting&#160;of me&#160;standing over the giant Antaeus. Rachel had&#160;<br/>
painted it a couple of months ago. My&#160;expression in&#160;the picture was fierce—disturbing, even—so it was&#160;<br/>hard to tell if&#160;I was the good guy or the bad guy,&#160;but&#160;Rachel said I'd looked just like that after the battle.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Demigods,&#34;&#160;</i>Rachel&#160;muttered as she threw another dart at the canvas. &#34;And their&#160;<i>stupid&#160;</i>quests.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Most of the darts bounced&#160;off, but a few stuck. One hung&#160;off my&#160;chin like a goatee.&#160;<br/>Someone pounded on&#160;her bedroom&#160;door.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel!&#34; a&#160;man shouted.&#160;&#34;What in the&#160;world are you&#160;doing? Turn&#160;off that—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel scooped up her remote control and shut off&#160;the&#160;music. &#34;Come in!&#34;&#160;<br/>Her dad walked in, scowling and blinking from&#160;the light. He had rust-colored hair a little darker than&#160;<br/>
Rachel's.&#160;It&#160;was smushed&#160;on one side&#160;like he'd&#160;lost&#160;a fight with&#160;his pillow. His blue silk&#160;pajamas had&#160;<br/>&#34;WD&#34;&#160;monogrammed on the pocket. Seriously, who&#160;has&#160;monogrammed pajamas?&#160;<br/>
&#34;What is going&#160;on?&#34; he&#160;demanded. &#34;It's&#160;three in the morning.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Couldn't sleep,&#34; Rachel said.&#160;<br/>On the painting, a dart fell&#160;off my&#160;face.&#160;Rachel&#160;hid the rest behind her back, but&#160;Mr. Dare noticed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So . . . I take it your friend isn't coming to St. Thomas?&#34; That's&#160;what Mr.&#160;Dare called&#160;me. Never&#160;<br/>
<i>Percy.&#160;</i>Just&#160;<i>your friend.&#160;</i>Or&#160;<i>young man&#160;</i>if&#160;he was talking to me, which he rarely&#160;did.&#160;<br/>
Rachel knit her eyebrows.&#160;&#34;I don't know.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a>&#34;We leave in the morning,&#34; her dad said.&#160;&#34;If he hasn't&#160;made up his mind&#160;yet—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He's probably not coming,&#34; Rachel said&#160;miserably.&#160;&#34;Happy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mr. Dare put&#160;his hands behind his back.&#160;He paced the room&#160;with a stern expression. I imagined&#160;he did&#160;<br/>
that in the boardroom&#160;of his land development company&#160;and made&#160;his employees nervous.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you still&#160;having&#160;bad dreams?&#34; he asked. &#34;Headaches?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel threw&#160;her darts on the floor. &#34;I should&#160;never have told&#160;you about that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;your father,&#34; he said.&#160;&#34;I'm&#160;worried about&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Worried about the family's reputation,&#34; Rachel&#160;muttered.&#160;<br/>
Her father didn't react—maybe because&#160;he'd heard that comment before, or&#160;maybe because&#160;it was&#160;<br/>
true.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We could call Dr. Arkwright,&#34;&#160;he suggested. &#34;He helped&#160;you get through the death of&#160;your hamster.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;I was six then,&#34; she said.&#160;&#34;And&#160;no,&#160;Dad, I don't need a therapist. I just&#160;. .&#160;.&#34;&#160;She shook&#160;her head&#160;<br/>
helplessly.&#160;<br/>
Her father stopped in&#160;front&#160;of the windows. He&#160;gazed at the New York skyline as if he owned it—<br/>
which wasn't&#160;true. He only&#160;owned part of&#160;it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It will be good for&#160;you to&#160;get away,&#34; he&#160;decided. &#34;You've had some unhealthy&#160;influences.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm not going to Clarion Ladies Academy,&#34; Rachel said. &#34;And my&#160;friends are none of your&#160;<br/>
business.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mr. Dare&#160;smiled, but it wasn't&#160;a warm&#160;smile. It was&#160;more&#160;like,&#160;<i>Someday you'll realize how silly you&#160;</i><br/>
<i>sound.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Try to&#160;get some sleep,&#34; he urged. &#34;We'll be&#160;at the beach by&#160;tomorrow night. It&#160;will be fun.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Fun,&#34; Rachel repeated. &#34;Lots of fun.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her father exited the room. He left the door open&#160;behind&#160;him.&#160;<br/>Rachel&#160;stared&#160;at the portrait of&#160;me. Then&#160;she walked&#160;to the easel&#160;next to it, which was&#160;covered in a&#160;<br/>
sheet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I hope they're dreams,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>
She uncovered the easel. On it was a hastily sketched charcoal, but&#160;Rachel was a good artist. The&#160;<br/>
picture was definitely&#160;Luke as a young boy.&#160;He was&#160;about nine years old, with&#160;a wide grin and no scar on&#160;<br/>his face.&#160;I had no idea how Rachel could've known what&#160;he looked like back then, but the portrait was so&#160;<br/>good I&#160;had a&#160;feeling she wasn't&#160;guessing. From&#160;what I&#160;knew about Luke's&#160;life (which wasn't&#160;much), the&#160;<br/>picture showed him&#160;just before he'd&#160;found out&#160;he was a half-blood and had run away&#160;from&#160;home.&#160;<br/>
Rachel&#160;stared&#160;at the portrait. Then she uncovered the next easel. This&#160;picture was&#160;even&#160;more&#160;<br/>
disturbing. It&#160;showed the Empire State&#160;Building with&#160;lightning all around it. In&#160;the distance a dark storm&#160;<br/>was brewing, with a huge&#160;hand coming out&#160;of the&#160;clouds. At the base of the building&#160;a crowd had&#160;<br/>gathered . . .&#160;but it wasn't&#160;a normal crowd of tourists and pedestrians. I saw&#160;spears, javelins, and ban-<br/>ners—the trappings&#160;of an&#160;army.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Rachel muttered, as if she knew I was listening, &#34;what is&#160;going on?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The dream&#160;faded, and the last thing I remember was wishing I could answer her&#160;question.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a>The next morning,&#160;I wanted to&#160;call her,&#160;but&#160;there were no&#160;phones at camp. Dionysus and&#160;Chiron&#160;didn't&#160;<br/>need a landline. They&#160;just called&#160;Olympus with an&#160;Iris-message&#160;whenever&#160;they&#160;needed something. And&#160;<br/>when demigods use cell phones, the signals agitate every&#160;monster&#160;within a hundred&#160;miles. It's&#160;like sending&#160;<br/>up a flare:&#160;<i>Here I am! Please rearrange my face!&#160;</i>Even&#160;within&#160;the safe borders of&#160;camp, that's&#160;not the kind&#160;<br/>of advertising&#160;we wanted to do.&#160;<br/>
Most demigods (except for Annabeth and a few others) don't&#160;even own cell phones. And I definitely&#160;<br/>
couldn't tell&#160;Annabeth, &#34;Hey, let&#160;me&#160;borrow your&#160;phone&#160;so I&#160;can call Rachel!&#34; To&#160;make the call, I&#160;<br/>would've had to leave camp and walk several&#160;miles to&#160;the nearest convenience store. Even if&#160;Chiron&#160;let&#160;<br/>me go, by&#160;the&#160;time I got there, Rachel&#160;would've been on the plane to&#160;St. Thomas.&#160;<br/>
I ate a depressing breakfast by&#160;myself at the Poseidon table. I kept&#160;staring at the&#160;fissure in the&#160;marble&#160;<br/>
floor where two&#160;years ago Nico had banished a bunch of bloodthirsty&#160;skeletons&#160;to the Underworld. The&#160;<br/>memory&#160;didn't exactly&#160;improve my&#160;appetite.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
After breakfast, Annabeth&#160;and I walked&#160;down to inspect the cabins. Actually, it was Annabeth's&#160;turn for&#160;<br/>inspection. My&#160;morning chore was to sort through reports for Chiron. But&#160;since we both&#160;hated our&#160;jobs,&#160;<br/>we decided to do them&#160;together so it wouldn't be so heinous.&#160;<br/>
We started at&#160;the Poseidon cabin, which was basically just me. I'd&#160;made&#160;my&#160;bunk bed&#160;that&#160;morning&#160;<br/>
(well, sort of) and straightened the Minotaur horn&#160;on the wall, so I gave myself a four out of five.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth made a face. &#160;&#34;You're being generous.&#34; She used the end&#160;of her pencil to pick up an&#160;old pair&#160;<br/>
of running shorts.&#160;<br/>
I snatched them&#160;away. &#34;Hey, give me&#160;a&#160;break. I&#160;don't&#160;have Tyson cleaning up after&#160;me&#160;this summer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Three out of&#160;five,&#34; Annabeth said. I knew&#160;better than to argue, so&#160;we&#160;moved along.&#160;<br/>
I tried to skim through Chiron's stack&#160;of reports&#160;as&#160;we walked. There were&#160;messages from&#160;demigods,&#160;<br/>
nature spirits, and satyrs all around the country, writing about the latest&#160;monster activity.&#160;They&#160;were pretty&#160;<br/>depressing, and my&#160;ADHD brain did&#160;<i>not&#160;</i>like concentrating on depressing stuff.&#160;<br/>
Little battles were raging everywhere. Camp&#160;recruitment was down to zero. Satyrs were having&#160;<br/>
trouble finding new demigods and bringing them&#160;to&#160;Half-Blood Hill because so many&#160;monsters were&#160;<br/>roaming the&#160;country. Our&#160;friend Thalia, who led the Hunters of Artemis, hadn't been heard from&#160;in&#160;<br/>months, and if Artemis knew what had happened&#160;to them, she wasn't sharing information.&#160;<br/>
We visited the Aphrodite cabin, which&#160;of&#160;course got&#160;a five out&#160;of five. The beds&#160;were perfectly made.&#160;<br/>
The clothes in everyone's&#160;footlockers were color&#160;coordinated. Fresh flowers bloomed on the windowsills.&#160;<br/>I wanted to dock a point&#160;because the&#160;whole place reeked of designer perfume, but Annabeth ignored me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Great job as usual, Silena,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>
Silena nodded listlessly.&#160;The wall behind her bed was&#160;decorated with pictures of Beckendorf. She sat&#160;<br/>
on her&#160;bunk&#160;with a box of&#160;chocolates on&#160;her lap,&#160;and&#160;I remembered that&#160;her dad owned a&#160;chocolate store&#160;<br/>in the Village, which was how he'd&#160;caught the attention of Aphrodite.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You want a&#160;bonbon?&#34; Silena asked. &#160;&#34;My&#160;dad sent them. He thought—he thought they&#160;might cheer&#160;<br/>
me up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are they&#160;any good?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=33></a>She shook&#160;her head. &#34;They taste like cardboard.&#34;&#160;<br/>I didn't have&#160;anything against cardboard, so I tried&#160;one. Annabeth&#160;passed. We promised to see Silena&#160;<br/>
later and kept going.&#160;<br/>
As we&#160;crossed the commons area, a fight broke&#160;out between the Ares&#160;and Apollo cabins. Some&#160;<br/>
Apollo campers armed&#160;with firebombs flew over the&#160;Ares cabin in a chariot&#160;pulled by&#160;two pegasi. I'd&#160;<br/>never seen the chariot before, but it looked like a pretty&#160;sweet ride. Soon, the roof of the Ares cabin was&#160;<br/>burning, and&#160;naiads from&#160;the canoe lake&#160;rushed over to&#160;blow water on it.&#160;<br/>
Then the Ares campers called down a&#160;curse, and all&#160;the Apollo&#160;kids'&#160;arrows&#160;turned to&#160;rubber. The&#160;<br/>
Apollo kids kept shooting&#160;at the Ares kids, but the arrows bounced&#160;off.&#160;<br/>
Two archers&#160;ran by, chased by&#160;an angry Ares kid who was yelling in poetry:&#160;&#34;Curse&#160;me, eh?&#160;I'll&#160;make&#160;<br/>
you&#160;pay!&#160;/ I don't want to rhyme all day!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth sighed. &#34;Not that again. Last&#160;time Apollo cursed a cabin, it took a&#160;week for the&#160;rhyming&#160;<br/>
couplets to wear off.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I shuddered.&#160;Apollo was&#160;god&#160;of&#160;poetry as well as archery,&#160;and&#160;I'd heard him&#160;recite in person. I'd&#160;<br/>
almost rather&#160;yet shot by an arrow.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What are they fighting about anyway?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>Annabeth ignored me&#160;while she scribbled on&#160;her inspection scroll, giving&#160;both&#160;cabins a one&#160;out&#160;of&#160;<br/>
five.&#160;<br/>
I found myself staring at her, which was stupid since I'd seen her a billion times. She and I were about&#160;<br/>
the same height this summer,&#160;which was&#160;a relief.&#160;Still,&#160;she seemed so&#160;much&#160;more&#160;mature. It was kind of&#160;<br/>intimidating. I mean, sure,&#160;she'd always&#160;been cute, but she was starting to&#160;be seriously&#160;beautiful.&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;she said, &#34;That flying chariot.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;You asked what they&#160;were fighting about.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh. Oh, right.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;They&#160;captured it in a raid&#160;in Philadelphia last week. Some of Luke's&#160;demigods were there&#160;with that&#160;<br/>
flying chariot. The Apollo&#160;cabin seized it during the battle, but&#160;the Ares cabin&#160;led the raid. So&#160;they've&#160;<br/>been fighting&#160;about who&#160;gets it ever since.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We ducked as&#160;Michael Yew's chariot dive-bombed an&#160;Ares camper. The Ares camper tried to stab&#160;<br/>
him&#160;and cuss&#160;him&#160;out in rhyming couplets. He was pretty&#160;creative about rhyming those cuss words.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We're fighting for&#160;our lives,&#34; I said, &#34;and they're bickering about&#160;some&#160;stupid chariot.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;They'll get over it,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Clarisse&#160;will come to her senses.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wasn't&#160;so sure. That didn't sound like the Clarisse I&#160;knew.&#160;<br/>I scanned&#160;more reports&#160;and we inspected a few&#160;more cabins. Demeter got a four. Hephaestus got a&#160;<br/>
three and probably&#160;should've gotten lower, but with&#160;Beckendorf being gone and all, we cut them&#160;some&#160;<br/>slack. Hermes got a two, which was no surprise. All&#160;campers who didn't know their godly&#160;parentage were&#160;<br/>shoved into&#160;the Hermes cabin, and since the gods&#160;were kind&#160;of forgetful,&#160;that cabin&#160;was always&#160;<br/>overcrowded.&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;we got to Athena's cabin, which was orderly and clean&#160;as usual. Books were straightened on&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=34></a>the shelves.&#160;The armor was polished.&#160;Battle&#160;maps&#160;and blueprints&#160;decorated the walls. Only&#160;Annabeth's&#160;<br/>bunk was&#160;messy. It was covered in papers, and her silver laptop was still running.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Vlacas,&#34;&#160;</i>Annabeth muttered, which was basically&#160;calling herself an idiot in Greek.&#160;<br/>
Her second-in-command, Malcolm,&#160;suppressed a smile. &#34;Yeah,&#160;um&#160;. . . we cleaned everything else.&#160;<br/>
Didn't know if it<i>&#160;</i>was safe to move your&#160;notes.&#34;&#160;<br/>
That was probably&#160;smart.&#160;Annabeth had a bronze knife&#160;that she reserved just for&#160;monsters and people&#160;<br/>
who messed with her stuff.&#160;<br/>
Malcolm&#160;grinned at me. &#34;We'll wait outside while&#160;you finish&#160;inspection.&#34; The&#160;Athena campers filed&#160;<br/>
out the door&#160;while Annabeth cleaned up&#160;her bunk.&#160;<br/>
I shuffled uneasily&#160;and pretended to go through some&#160;more reports. Technically,&#160;even on inspection, it&#160;<br/>
was against camp rules for two campers to be . .&#160;. like,&#160;<i>alone&#160;</i>in a cabin.&#160;<br/>
That rule had&#160;come up a lot when Silena and Beckendorf started dating.&#160;And I know some of you&#160;<br/>
might be thinking, Aren't&#160;all demigods related on the&#160;godly&#160;side, and doesn't&#160;that make dating gross? But&#160;<br/>the thing is, the godly side of&#160;your family&#160;doesn't&#160;count, genetically&#160;speaking, since gods don't have DNA.&#160;<br/>A demigod would never think about dating someone&#160;who had the&#160;same godly&#160;parent. Like two kids from&#160;<br/>Athena cabin? No way.&#160;But a daughter of Aphrodite and a son&#160;of Hephaestus? They're not related. So it's&#160;<br/>no problem.&#160;<br/>
Anyway, for&#160;some&#160;strange reason I was&#160;thinking about&#160;this as I watched Annabeth straighten up. She&#160;<br/>
closed her laptop, which&#160;had been given&#160;to her as&#160;a gift from&#160;the inventor Daedalus last summer.&#160;<br/>
I cleared&#160;my&#160;throat. &#34;So&#160;. . . get&#160;any&#160;good info from&#160;that thing?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Too much,&#34; she&#160;said. &#34;Daedalus had&#160;so&#160;many&#160;ideas, I could spend fifty&#160;years&#160;just trying to figure&#160;<br/>
them&#160;all out.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#34; I&#160;muttered. &#34;That would be fun.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She shuffled her papers—mostly&#160;drawings of buildings and a bunch of handwritten notes. I knew she&#160;<br/>
wanted to be an architect&#160;someday,&#160;but I'd learned the hard way&#160;not to ask what she was&#160;working on.&#160;<br/>She'd start talking about angles and load-bearing joints until my&#160;eyes glazed over.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know . . .&#34; She brushed her hair behind her&#160;ear, like she does when she's nervous. &#34;This&#160;whole&#160;<br/>
thing with Beckendorf and&#160;Silena. It kind of makes&#160;you think. About . . . what's important. About losing&#160;<br/>people who are important.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded. My&#160;brain started seizing on&#160;little random&#160;details, like&#160;the fact that&#160;she was still wearing&#160;<br/>
those silver owl earrings from&#160;her dad, who was this&#160;brainiac&#160;military&#160;history&#160;professor in San Francisco.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Urn,&#160;yeah,&#34;&#160;I stammered. &#34;Like . . . is everything cool with&#160;your&#160;family?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Okay, really&#160;stupid&#160;question, but&#160;hey,&#160;I&#160;was nervous.&#160;<br/>Annabeth looked disappointed, but she nodded.&#160;<br/>&#34;My dad wanted to take me to Greece this summer,&#34; she said wistfully. &#34;I've always&#160;wanted to&#160;see—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;The Parthenon,&#34; I remembered.&#160;<br/>She managed&#160;a smile. &#34;Yeah.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;That's okay.&#160;There'll be other summers, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>As soon as I&#160;said it, I realized it was a boneheaded comment. I was facing the&#160;<i>end of&#160;my days.&#160;</i>Within&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=35></a>a week, Olympus&#160;might fall. If the Age of the Gods really&#160;did&#160;end, the world as we knew it would&#160;<br/>dissolve into&#160;chaos. Demigods would&#160;be hunted to&#160;extinction. There would be no&#160;more summers for us.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth stared at her inspection scroll.&#160;&#34;Three out&#160;five,&#34; she muttered, &#34;for a sloppy head counselor.&#160;<br/>
Come&#160;on. Let's finish your&#160;reports and get back to Chiron.&#34;&#160;<br/>
On the way to&#160;the Big House, we&#160;read the last report,&#160;which was handwritten on a maple leaf from&#160;a&#160;<br/>
satyr&#160;in Canada. If possible, the note made&#160;me&#160;feel even worse.&#160;<br/>
&#34; 'Dear&#160;Grover,'&#34;&#160;I read&#160;aloud. &#34; 'Woods outside Toronto attacked by&#160;giant evil&#160;badger. Tried to do as&#160;<br/>
you suggested and summon&#160;power of Pan. No effect. Many&#160;naiads'&#160;trees destroyed. Retreating to Ottawa.&#160;<br/>Please&#160;advise. Where are you? —Gleeson Hedge, protector.'&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth grimaced. &#34;You&#160;haven't heard&#160;<i>anything&#160;</i>from&#160;him?&#160;Even with&#160;your empathy&#160;link?&#34;&#160;<br/>I shook my&#160;head dejectedly.&#160;<br/>Ever since last summer when the god&#160;Pan had died,&#160;our friend Grover had been drifting farther and&#160;<br/>
farther away. The Council of Cloven Elders treated&#160;him&#160;like an outcast, but Grover still traveled all over&#160;<br/>the East Coast, trying to&#160;spread the word about&#160;Pan&#160;and convince&#160;nature spirits&#160;to protect their own little&#160;<br/>bits of the wild. He'd&#160;only come back to camp&#160;a few times to see his girlfriend, Juniper.&#160;<br/>
Last I'd heard&#160;he was in Central Park organizing the&#160;dryads, but nobody had seen or heard from&#160;him&#160;<br/>
in two months. We'd tried to send Iris-messages. They never got through. I had an empathy link with&#160;<br/>Grover, so I&#160;hoped I&#160;would&#160;know if&#160;anything&#160;bad happened to&#160;him.&#160;Grover had told me&#160;one time that if&#160;he&#160;<br/>died, the empathy link might kill me&#160;too. But I wasn't&#160;sure if that was still true or not.&#160;<br/>
I wondered if&#160;he was still in Manhattan. Then I&#160;thought about&#160;my dream&#160;of&#160;Rachel's&#160;sketch—dark&#160;<br/>
clouds closing on the city,&#160;an army&#160;gathered around the Empire State Building.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth.&#34;&#160;I stopped&#160;her by&#160;the tetherball court. I&#160;knew I was asking&#160;for trouble, but&#160;I&#160;didn't&#160;know&#160;<br/>
who else to trust. Plus, I'd&#160;always&#160;depended on&#160;Annabeth for advice. &#34;Listen, I had this dream&#160;about, um,&#160;<br/>Rachel . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I told her the whole thing,&#160;even the weird picture of Luke as a child.&#160;<br/>For a while she didn't say anything. Then she rolled up her inspection scroll so tight&#160;she ripped it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What do&#160;you&#160;want&#160;me&#160;to say?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm not sure. You're the best strategist&#160;I know.&#160;If&#160;you were Kronos planning this war, what would&#160;<br/>
you do&#160;next?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'd&#160;use Typhon as a distraction. Then I'd hit Olympus directly, while the gods were in the West.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Just like in&#160;Rachel's picture.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; she said, her voice tight,&#160;&#34;Rachel&#160;is just a mortal.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;But what if&#160;her dream&#160;is true? Those other Titans—they&#160;said&#160;Olympus would be&#160;destroyed&#160;in&#160;a&#160;<br/>
matter of days. They&#160;said they&#160;had plenty&#160;of other challenges. And what's with that picture of Luke as a&#160;<br/>kid—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll just have to be ready.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;How?&#34; I said. &#34;Look at our camp. We can't&#160;even stop fighting each other. And I'm supposed to get&#160;<br/>
my&#160;stupid soul reaped.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She threw down her scroll. &#34;I knew we shouldn't&#160;have shown&#160;you the prophecy.&#34;&#160;Her voice was angry&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=36></a>and hurt. &#34;All it did was scare you. You&#160;run&#160;away&#160;from&#160;things when&#160;you're scared.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at her, completely&#160;stunned.&#160;<i>&#34;Me?&#160;</i>Run away?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She got right&#160;in my&#160;face. &#34;Yes, you. You're a&#160;coward, Percy&#160;Jackson!&#34;&#160;<br/>
We were nose to nose. Her eyes were red, and I suddenly&#160;realized that when&#160;she called me a coward,&#160;<br/>
maybe she wasn't&#160;talking about the prophecy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;If&#160;you&#160;don't like our chances,&#34; she said, &#34;maybe&#160;you should go&#160;on that vacation with Rachel.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;If&#160;you&#160;don't like our company.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;That's not fair!&#34;&#160;<br/>She pushed past&#160;me&#160;and stormed toward the strawberry fields. She hit the&#160;tetherball as she passed and&#160;<br/>
sent it spinning angrily around&#160;the pole.&#160;<br/>
I'd like to say my&#160;day got&#160;better from&#160;there. Of course&#160;it didn't.&#160;<br/>
That afternoon we had an&#160;assembly&#160;at the campfire to&#160;burn Beckendorf's burial shroud and say&#160;our&#160;<br/>
good-byes. Even the Ares and Apollo cabins called a temporary&#160;truce to attend.&#160;<br/>
Beckendorf's&#160;shroud was&#160;made out of&#160;metal links, like chain&#160;mail. I didn't see&#160;how it would burn, but&#160;<br/>
the Fates&#160;must've been helping&#160;out. The metal&#160;melted&#160;in&#160;the fire and turned&#160;to golden smoke,&#160;which rose&#160;<br/>into the sky.&#160;The campfire flames&#160;always&#160;reflected the campers'&#160;moods, and&#160;today&#160;they&#160;burned black.&#160;<br/>
I hoped Beckendorf's spirit would end up&#160;in Elysium.&#160;Maybe he'd&#160;even choose to be reborn&#160;and try&#160;<br/>
for Elysium&#160;in three different lifetimes&#160;so he could reach the Isles of the Blest, which was like the&#160;<br/>Underworld's&#160;ultimate party headquarters.&#160;If anyone deserved it, Beckendorf did.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth left without a word to me. Most of the&#160;other&#160;campers drifted off to their&#160;afternoon activities.&#160;<br/>
I just stood there staring at the dying&#160;fire. Silena&#160;sat nearby&#160;crying, while Clarisse&#160;and her boyfriend,&#160;<br/>Chris Rodriguez, tried to comfort her.&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;I got&#160;up the nerve to&#160;walk over.&#160;&#34;Hey, Silena,&#160;I'm really&#160;sorry.&#34;&#160;<br/>She sniffled.&#160;Clarisse&#160;glared&#160;at me, but she always&#160;glares at everyone. Chris would barely&#160;look at me.&#160;<br/>
He'd&#160;been one of Luke's&#160;men until Clarisse rescued&#160;him&#160;from&#160;the Labyrinth last summer, and I guess he&#160;<br/>still felt guilty about it.&#160;<br/>
I cleared&#160;my&#160;throat. &#34;Silena, you know Beckendorf carried your picture. He looked at it right&#160;before&#160;<br/>
we went into battle. You meant a lot to him.&#160;You made the last year the best of his life.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena sobbed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good work,&#160;Percy,&#34; Clarisse&#160;muttered.&#160;<br/>&#34;No, it's all right,&#34; Silena said. &#34;Thank&#160;.&#160;. . thank&#160;you,&#160;Percy.&#160;I should&#160;go.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;You want company?&#34; Clarisse asked.&#160;<br/>
Silena shook&#160;her head and&#160;ran off.&#160;<br/>
&#34;She's&#160;stronger than she looks,&#34; Clarisse muttered, almost to herself. &#34;She'll survive.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;You could&#160;help with that,&#34; I suggested. &#34;You could honor Beckendorf's&#160;memory&#160;by&#160;fighting with&#160;<br/>
us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Clarisse&#160;went for her knife, but it wasn't&#160;there anymore. She'd thrown it on the&#160;Ping-Pong table in the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=37></a>Big House.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not my&#160;problem,&#34; she growled. &#34;My cabin doesn't&#160;get honor, I don't fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>I noticed she wasn't&#160;speaking in rhymes. Maybe she hadn't been&#160;around when&#160;her cabinmates got&#160;<br/>
cursed, or&#160;maybe she had a way&#160;of breaking the spell. With a chill, I wondered if Clarisse could be&#160;<br/>Kronos's&#160;spy&#160;at camp. Was that why she was keeping&#160;her cabin out&#160;of the fight?&#160;But as much&#160;as I disliked&#160;<br/>Clarisse, spying for the Titans didn't seem&#160;like her style.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right,&#34; I&#160;told her. &#34;I&#160;didn't want to bring&#160;this up,&#160;but&#160;you owe me one. You'd be rotting&#160;in a&#160;<br/>
Cyclops's cave in the Sea of Monsters if it wasn't for&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She clenched&#160;her jaw. &#34;Any&#160;other favor, Percy.&#160;Not this. The Ares&#160;cabin has&#160;been dissed too many&#160;<br/>
times. And don't think I&#160;don't know what people say&#160;about me&#160;behind my&#160;back.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to say,&#160;<i>Well, it's true.&#160;</i>But I bit&#160;my&#160;tongue.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So, what—you're just going to let Kronos crush us?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>&#34;If&#160;you want&#160;my&#160;help so bad, tell Apollo&#160;to give us the chariot.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#34;You're such&#160;a big baby.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She charged me, but Chris got&#160;between us. &#34;Whoa,&#160;guys,&#34; he said. &#34;Clarisse, you know, maybe he's&#160;<br/>
got a point.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She sneered at him.&#160;&#34;Not you too!&#34; She trudged off&#160;with Chris at her heels.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, wait! I&#160;just meant—Clarisse, wait!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I watched the last sparks from&#160;Beckendorf's fire curl&#160;into the afternoon sky. Then&#160;I headed toward the&#160;<br/>
sword-fighting arena. I needed a break, and I wanted to see an old friend.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
FIVE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;DRIVE &#160;MY &#160;DOG &#160;INTO&#160;<br/>
A &#160;TREE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;saw&#160;me before I saw her,&#160;which was&#160;a&#160;pretty good trick considering she's the size of a&#160;<br/>
garbage truck. I walked into the arena,&#160;and a wall of darkness slammed into me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;WOOF!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The next thing I knew I was flat on the&#160;ground with&#160;a huge paw on my&#160;chest and an&#160;oversize Brillo-<br/>
pad tongue licking my&#160;face.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ow!&#34; I said. &#34;Hey, girl. Good to&#160;see you too.&#160;<i>Ow!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
It took a few&#160;minutes for&#160;Mrs. O'Leary to calm down and get off&#160;me. By&#160;then I was pretty&#160;much&#160;<br/>
drenched in dog drool. She wanted to play&#160;fetch, so&#160;I picked up a bronze shield and tossed it across the&#160;<br/>arena.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=38></a>By&#160;the way,&#160;Mrs. O'Leary&#160;is the world's only&#160;friendly&#160;hellhound.&#160;I kind of inherited her when her&#160;<br/>
previous owner died. She lived at camp, but Beckendorf . . . well, Beckendorf&#160;<i>used to&#160;</i>take&#160;care of her&#160;<br/>whenever I was gone. He had smelted Mrs. O'Leary's favorite bronze chewing bone. He'd forged her&#160;<br/>collar with the little smiley&#160;face and a&#160;crossbones name&#160;tag. Next&#160;to&#160;me, Beckendorf had&#160;been her best&#160;<br/>friend.&#160;<br/>
Thinking about that&#160;made&#160;me&#160;sad&#160;all over again, but&#160;I&#160;threw the&#160;shield a few&#160;more&#160;times&#160;because Mrs.&#160;<br/>
O'Leary&#160;insisted.&#160;<br/>
Soon she started barking—a sound slightly&#160;louder than an artillery gun—like&#160;she needed to go for a&#160;<br/>
walk. The other campers&#160;didn't think&#160;it&#160;was funny&#160;when&#160;she went to the&#160;bathroom&#160;in the arena. It had&#160;<br/>caused&#160;more&#160;than one&#160;unfortunate slip-and-slide accident. So I opened the gates of the arena, and she&#160;<br/>bounded straight toward the woods.&#160;<br/>
I jogged after her, not too concerned that she&#160;was&#160;getting ahead. Nothing in the woods could threaten&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary.&#160;Even the dragons and&#160;giant&#160;scorpions ran away&#160;when&#160;she came close.&#160;<br/>
When I finally&#160;tracked her down, she wasn't&#160;using&#160;the facilities. She was in&#160;a familiar&#160;clearing where&#160;<br/>
the Council of Cloven Elders had once&#160;put Grover on&#160;trial. The place didn't look so good.&#160;The grass had&#160;<br/>turned&#160;yellow.&#160;The three topiary&#160;thrones&#160;had lost all their leaves. But that's not&#160;what surprised me. In the&#160;<br/>middle of the glade stood the weirdest trio I'd ever&#160;seen: Juniper the tree nymph, Nico di Angelo, and&#160;a&#160;<br/>very&#160;old,&#160;very&#160;fat satyr.&#160;<br/>
Nico was the only&#160;one who didn't&#160;seem freaked out&#160;by&#160;Mrs. O'Leary's appearance. He looked pretty&#160;<br/>
much like I'd&#160;seen him&#160;in my&#160;dream—an&#160;aviator's jacket, black jeans, and a T-shirt with dancing skeletons&#160;<br/>on it, like one of those Day&#160;of the Dead pictures. His Stygian iron&#160;sword hung at his side. He was only&#160;<br/>twelve, but he&#160;looked much older and sadder.&#160;<br/>
He nodded when he saw me, then went&#160;back to scratching Mrs.&#160;O'Leary's ears. She sniffed his legs&#160;<br/>
like he was the&#160;most interesting thing since rib-eye&#160;steaks. Being the son of Hades, he'd&#160;probably&#160;been&#160;<br/>traveling in all sorts of hellhound-friendly places.&#160;<br/>
The old&#160;satyr&#160;didn't&#160;look&#160;nearly&#160;so&#160;happy. &#34;Will&#160;someone—what is this&#160;<i>underworld&#160;</i>creature doing in&#160;<br/>
my&#160;forest!&#34;&#160;He waved his arms and trotted on his hooves as if the grass were&#160;hot. &#34;You there, Percy&#160;<br/>Jackson! Is this your beast?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sorry, Leneus,&#34; I said. &#34;That's your name, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The satyr&#160;rolled his eyes. His fur was dust-bunny gray, and a spiderweb grew between his horns. His&#160;<br/>
belly&#160;would've&#160;made him&#160;an invincible&#160;bumper&#160;car. &#34;Well, of course I'm Leneus. Don't tell&#160;me&#160;you've&#160;<br/>forgotten a member of the Council so&#160;quickly. Now, call off&#160;your&#160;beast!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;WOOF!&#34;&#160;</i>Mrs. O'Leary&#160;said happily.&#160;<br/>
The old satyr&#160;gulped.&#160;&#34;Make it go away!&#160;Juniper, I will&#160;not help&#160;you&#160;under these circumstances!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Juniper turned&#160;toward me.&#160;She was pretty in a dryad-y&#160;way,&#160;with&#160;her purple gossamer dress&#160;and her&#160;<br/>
elfish face, but her eyes were green-tinted with chlorophyll from&#160;crying.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=39></a>&#34;Percy,&#34; she sniffled. &#34;I was just asking about Grover.&#160;I&#160;<i>know&#160;</i>something's happened. He wouldn't stay&#160;<br/>
gone this long&#160;if he wasn't&#160;in&#160;trouble. I&#160;was hoping that Leneus—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I told&#160;you!&#34;&#160;the satyr&#160;protested. &#34;You are better off without that traitor.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Juniper stamped her foot. &#34;He is not&#160;a traitor! He's&#160;the bravest satyr ever, and I want to know where&#160;<br/>
he is!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;WOOF!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
Leneus's knees started knocking. &#34;I . . . I won't answer&#160;questions with this hellhound sniffing my tail!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico looked like he was trying to&#160;not crack up. &#34;I'll walk the dog,&#34;&#160;he volunteered.&#160;<br/>
He whistled, and Mrs. O'Leary&#160;bounded&#160;after him&#160;to the far end of&#160;the grove.&#160;<br/>
Leneus huffed indignantly&#160;and brushed&#160;the twigs off&#160;his shirt. &#34;Now, as I was trying to&#160;explain,&#160;young&#160;<br/>
lady,&#160;your boyfriend has not sent&#160;<i>any&#160;</i>reports since we voted him&#160;into exile.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You&#160;<i>tried&#160;</i>to&#160;vote him&#160;into exile,&#34; I corrected. &#34;Chiron and Dionysus stopped&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bah! They&#160;are&#160;<i>honorary&#160;</i>Council members. It wasn't&#160;a proper vote.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll tell Dionysus&#160;you said&#160;that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Leneus paled. &#34;I only meant . . . Now see here, Jackson. This is none of&#160;your&#160;business.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Grover's&#160;my&#160;friend,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;He wasn't&#160;lying to&#160;you&#160;about Pan's death. I saw it&#160;myself. You were just&#160;<br/>
too scared to accept the truth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Leneus's lips quivered. &#34;No! Grover's a&#160;liar and good&#160;riddance. We're better off without him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I pointed at the withered thrones. &#34;If things are going&#160;so well, where are your friends? Looks like your&#160;<br/>
Council hasn't&#160;been meeting lately.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maron and Silenus . . . I&#160;. . . I'm sure they'll be back,&#34; he said, but I could hear&#160;the panic in his voice.&#160;<br/>
&#34;They're just&#160;taking some&#160;time off to think. It's&#160;been a very unsettling&#160;year.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's going to&#160;get a lot more unsettling,&#34; I&#160;promised. &#34;Leneus, we&#160;<i>need&#160;</i>Grover. There's got to be a way&#160;<br/>
you can find&#160;him&#160;with your&#160;magic.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The old satyr's&#160;eye twitched. &#34;I'm&#160;telling&#160;you,&#160;I've heard nothing.&#160;Perhaps he's dead.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Juniper choked back a sob.&#160;<br/>
&#34;He's not dead,&#34; I said. &#34;I can feel<i>&#160;</i>that much.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Empathy&#160;links,&#34; Leneus said disdainfully. &#34;Very unreliable.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So ask around,&#34; I insisted. &#34;Find&#160;him. There's a&#160;war coming. Grover was preparing the nature&#160;<br/>
spirits.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Without&#160;my&#160;permission! And it's not&#160;<i>our&#160;</i>war.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I grabbed him by&#160;the shirt, which seriously&#160;wasn't&#160;like&#160;me, but the stupid old&#160;goat was&#160;making me&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=40></a>mad. &#34;Listen, Leneus. When Kronos&#160;attacks, he's going&#160;to&#160;have&#160;<i>packs&#160;&#160;</i>of hellhounds.&#160;He's going to&#160;<br/>destroy&#160;everything in&#160;his path—mortals, gods, demigods.&#160;Do&#160;you think&#160;he'll let the satyrs go free? You're&#160;<br/>supposed to&#160;be a leader. So LEAD. Get out there&#160;and see what's&#160;happening. Find Grover&#160;and bring&#160;<br/>Juniper some&#160;news. Now,&#160;GO!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't push&#160;him&#160;very&#160;hard, but&#160;he was kind of top-heavy.&#160;He fell on his furry rump, then scrambled&#160;<br/>
to his hooves and ran away&#160;with his&#160;belly&#160;jiggling.&#160;&#34;Grover will never be accepted!&#160;He will die&#160;an&#160;<br/>outcast!&#34;&#160;<br/>
When he'd disappeared into the bushes,&#160;Juniper wiped her eyes. &#34;I'm&#160;sorry,&#160;Percy. I&#160;didn't mean to get&#160;<br/>
you involved.&#160;Leneus is still a lord of the Wild. You&#160;don't want to make an enemy&#160;of him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No problem,&#34; I said. &#34;I've got worse enemies than overweight satyrs.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico walked&#160;back to us. &#34;Good job, Percy.&#160;Judging&#160;from&#160;the trail of goat pellets, I'd say&#160;you shook&#160;<br/>
him&#160;up pretty well.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was afraid I&#160;knew why&#160;Nico was&#160;here,&#160;but I tried&#160;for a smile.&#160;&#34;Welcome&#160;back.&#160;Did you come by&#160;just&#160;<br/>
to see Juniper?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He blushed. &#34;Um,&#160;no. That was an&#160;accident. I kind of . . . dropped into&#160;the&#160;middle&#160;of their&#160;<br/>
conversation.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He scared us to death!&#34; Juniper said. &#34;Right out of the shadows. But, Nico,&#160;you&#160;<i>are&#160;</i>the son of Hades&#160;<br/>
and all. Are you sure&#160;you haven't heard anything&#160;about&#160;Grover?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico shifted his weight. &#34;Juniper, like I&#160;tried to tell&#160;you . . . even if&#160;Grover died, he would reincarnate&#160;<br/>
into something else in nature. I can't&#160;sense things like&#160;that, only mortal souls.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But if&#160;you&#160;<i>do&#160;</i>hear anything?&#34;&#160;she pleaded, putting&#160;her hand on&#160;his arm.&#160;&#34;Anything at all?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico's cheeks got even&#160;brighter red. &#34;Uh,&#160;you&#160;bet. I'll keep&#160;my&#160;ears open.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll find him,&#160;Juniper,&#34;&#160;I promised. &#34;Grover's alive, I'm sure. There&#160;must&#160;be&#160;a simple&#160;reason why&#160;<br/>
he hasn't contacted us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She nodded&#160;glumly. &#34;I&#160;hate not being&#160;able to leave the forest. He could&#160;be anywhere, and&#160;I'm&#160;stuck&#160;<br/>
here waiting. Oh, if that silly goat has gotten himself hurt—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;bounded back&#160;over and took an interest in Juniper's dress.&#160;<br/>
Juniper&#160;yelped. &#34;Oh, no&#160;you don't!&#160;I know about dogs and trees. I'm&#160;gone!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She went&#160;<i>poof&#160;&#160;</i>into green&#160;mist. Mrs.&#160;O'Leary&#160;looked disappointed, but she lumbered off&#160;to find&#160;<br/>
another target, leaving Nico and me&#160;alone.&#160;<br/>
Nico tapped his sword on the ground. A tiny&#160;mound of animal bones erupted from the dirt. They&#160;knit&#160;<br/>
themselves together into a&#160;skeletal&#160;field&#160;mouse&#160;and scampered off. &#34;I&#160;was sorry&#160;to hear about&#160;<br/>Beckendorf.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A lump&#160;formed in my&#160;throat. &#34;How did&#160;you—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=41></a>&#34;I talked to his ghost.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh . . . right.&#34;&#160;I'd never get used to the fact that&#160;this twelve-year-old kid spent more time&#160;talking with&#160;<br/>
the dead than&#160;the living.&#160;&#34;Did he say anything?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He doesn't&#160;blame you. He figured&#160;you'd be beating&#160;yourself up, and he said&#160;you&#160;shouldn't.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is he going&#160;to&#160;try&#160;for rebirth?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico shook his head. &#34;He's staying in&#160;Elysium.&#160;Said he's&#160;waiting for someone. Not sure what he&#160;<br/>
meant, but he seems okay&#160;with death.&#34;&#160;<br/>
It wasn't&#160;much&#160;comfort, but it was something.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I had a vision&#160;you were on Mount Tarn,&#34; I told&#160;Nico. &#34;Was that—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Real,&#34; he said. &#34;I didn't mean to be spying on&#160;the Titans, but I was in the neighborhood.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Doing what?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico tugged&#160;at his sword belt. &#34;Following a lead on .&#160;. .&#160;you know,&#160;my&#160;family.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded. I knew his past&#160;was&#160;a painful subject. Until&#160;two years ago, he and his sister Bianca had been&#160;<br/>
frozen in time at a place&#160;called the Lotus Hotel and&#160;Casino. They'd been there for like seventy&#160;years.&#160;<br/>Eventually&#160;a mysterious lawyer rescued them&#160;and checked them&#160;into a boarding school, but&#160;Nico had no&#160;<br/>memories of&#160;his life before the casino. He didn't know anything about his mother.&#160;He didn't know who the&#160;<br/>lawyer was,&#160;or why&#160;they'd been frozen in time or&#160;allowed to go free. After&#160;Bianca died&#160;and left Nico&#160;<br/>alone, he'd been obsessed&#160;with finding&#160;answers.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So how&#160;did it&#160;go?&#34; I asked. &#34;Any&#160;luck?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; he murmured. &#34;But I may&#160;have a new lead soon.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's the lead?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico chewed&#160;his lip. &#34;That's not important right&#160;now.&#160;You know why&#160;I'm&#160;here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A feeling of&#160;dread started to&#160;build in&#160;my&#160;chest. Ever since Nico&#160;first proposed his&#160;plan for beating&#160;<br/>
Kronos last summer, I'd had nightmares about it. He&#160;would show up occasionally and press&#160;me for an&#160;<br/>answer, but I kept putting&#160;him&#160;off.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nico, I don't know,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;It seems&#160;pretty&#160;extreme.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You've got&#160;Typhon coming in, what . . . a&#160;week? Most of the other Titans&#160;are&#160;unleashed now and on&#160;<br/>
Kronos's&#160;side. Maybe it's time to think extreme.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked&#160;back toward the&#160;camp. Even from&#160;this distance I could&#160;hear the Ares and Apollo&#160;campers&#160;<br/>
fighting&#160;again,&#160;yelling curses and spouting bad&#160;poetry.&#160;<br/>
&#34;They're no&#160;match for the Titan army,&#34; Nico said. &#34;You know&#160;that. This comes down to&#160;you&#160;and&#160;<br/>
Luke. And there's only&#160;one&#160;way&#160;you can&#160;beat Luke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I remembered the fight on the&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda.&#160;</i>I'd been hopelessly&#160;outmatched. Kronos had&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=42></a>almost killed&#160;me&#160;with a single cut to&#160;my&#160;arm,&#160;and I couldn't even wound him.&#160;Riptide had glanced right&#160;<br/>off his skin.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We can give you the same power,&#34; Nico urged.&#160;&#34;You heard the Great Prophecy. Unless you want to&#160;<br/>
have your soul reaped by&#160;a cursed blade . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wondered how Nico had heard the prophecy— probably from&#160;some ghost.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can't prevent a prophecy,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;But&#160;you&#160;can fight it.&#34;&#160;Nico had a strange, hungry&#160;light&#160;m&#160;his eyes. &#34;You can become invincible.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maybe we should&#160;wait. Try&#160;to fight without—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; Nico snarled. &#34;It has to be now!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at him.&#160;I hadn't&#160;seen his temper flare like that in a long&#160;time. &#34;Urn,&#160;you&#160;sure you're okay?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He took a&#160;deep breath. &#34;Percy, all I&#160;mean . .&#160;. when&#160;the fighting starts, we won't be able to&#160;make the&#160;<br/>
journey.&#160;This&#160;is our last chance. I'm&#160;sorry if I'm&#160;being too&#160;pushy,&#160;but two&#160;years&#160;ago my&#160;sister gave her life&#160;<br/>to protect&#160;you.&#160;I want&#160;you&#160;to&#160;honor that.&#160;Do whatever&#160;it takes to stay alive and defeat Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't like the idea. Then I thought about Annabeth&#160;calling me a coward, and I&#160;got angry.&#160;<br/>
Nico had a point. If Kronos attacked New York, the campers would be no match for his forces. I had&#160;<br/>
to do something. Nico's&#160;way was dangerous—maybe&#160;even deadly.&#160;But it might give me&#160;a fighting edge.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right,&#34; I&#160;decided.<i>&#160;</i>&#34;What do we do first?&#34;&#160;<br/>
His cold creepy&#160;smile&#160;made&#160;me sorry&#160;I'd agreed. &#34;First&#160;we'll&#160;need&#160;to retrace&#160;Luke's&#160;steps.&#160;We&#160;need to&#160;<br/>
know more about&#160;his past,&#160;his childhood.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I shuddered, thinking about&#160;Rachel's&#160;picture from&#160;my&#160;dream—a smiling nine-year-old Luke. &#34;Why&#160;do&#160;<br/>
we need to know about that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll explain&#160;when we get&#160;there,&#34; Nico&#160;said. &#34;I've&#160;already&#160;tracked down his mother. She&#160;lives in&#160;<br/>
Connecticut.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at him.&#160;I'd never thought much about Luke's&#160;mortal parent. I'd&#160;met his dad, Hermes, but&#160;his&#160;<br/>
mom . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke ran away&#160;when&#160;he was really&#160;young,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;I didn't think his&#160;mom&#160;was alive.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, she's alive.&#34; The way&#160;he said it made&#160;me&#160;wonder what was wrong with her. What kind of&#160;<br/>
horrible person&#160;could she&#160;be?&#160;<br/>
&#34;Okay&#160;.&#160;. .&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;So how&#160;do we get&#160;to&#160;Connecticut?&#160;I can call Blackjack—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No.&#34; Nico scowled. &#34;Pegasi don't like&#160;me,&#160;and the feeling is&#160;mutual. But there's no need for flying.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He whistled, and Mrs. O'Leary&#160;came&#160;loping&#160;out of&#160;the woods.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your friend&#160;here can help.&#34; Nico patted her&#160;head. &#34;You haven't tried shadow travel&#160;yet?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Shadow travel?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=43></a>Nico whispered in Mrs. O'Leary's ear. She tilted her head, suddenly alert.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hop on&#160;board,&#34; Nico told&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
I'd never considered riding a dog before, bur Mrs.&#160;O'Leary&#160;was&#160;certainly&#160;big enough. I climbed onto&#160;<br/>
her back and&#160;held her collar.&#160;<br/>
&#34;This will make her very&#160;tired,&#34; Nico warned, &#34;so&#160;you&#160;can't&#160;do it often. And it works best at night. But&#160;<br/>
all shadows are part of the&#160;same&#160;substance. There&#160;is only&#160;one darkness, and creatures of the Underworld&#160;<br/>can use it as a&#160;road, or a door.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't understand,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; Nico said. &#34;It took&#160;me a long time to learn.&#160;But Mrs. O'Leary&#160;knows.&#160;Tell her where to go. Tell&#160;<br/>
her Westport, the home of May&#160;Castellan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're not coming?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't worry,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;I'll meet you there.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was a little&#160;nervous, but&#160;I leaned down to Mrs. O'Leary's&#160;ear. &#34;Okay,&#160;girl. Uh, can you take&#160;me&#160;to&#160;<br/>
Westport, Connecticut?&#160;May&#160;Castellan's&#160;place?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary sniffed the&#160;air. She looked into the gloom&#160;of the&#160;forest. Then she bounded&#160;forward,&#160;<br/>
straight into an&#160;oak tree.&#160;<br/>
Just before we hit, we passed into shadows as cold as&#160;the dark side of the moon.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
SIX&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
MY &#160;COOKIES &#160;GET&#160;<br/>
SCORCHED&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>I don't recommend shadow travel if&#160;you're scared of:&#160;<br/>
a) The dark&#160;<br/>b)&#160;Cold shivers up&#160;your spine<i>&#160;<br/></i>c)&#160;Strange noises&#160;<br/>d)&#160;Going so fast&#160;you feel like&#160;your face is peeling off&#160;<br/>
In other words, I thought it was awesome. One&#160;minute I couldn't see anything. I could only&#160;feel Mrs.&#160;<br/>
O'Leary's fur&#160;and my&#160;fingers wrapped around&#160;the bronze links of her dog collar.&#160;<br/>
The next&#160;minute the shadows&#160;melted&#160;into a new&#160;scene. We&#160;were on a cliff in the woods of&#160;<br/>
Connecticut. At least, it looked like Connecticut from the&#160;few times I'd been there: lots of trees, low&#160;stone&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=44></a>walls, big houses. Down&#160;one side of&#160;the cliff,&#160;a highway&#160;cut through a ravine. Down the other side&#160;was&#160;<br/>someone's&#160;backyard.&#160;The&#160;property&#160;was huge—more wilderness than lawn. The house was&#160;a two-story&#160;<br/>white Colonial. Despite the fact that it&#160;was right on the other side&#160;of the hill from a highway, it felt&#160;like it&#160;<br/>was in the middle of&#160;nowhere. I could see a light glowing m&#160;the kitchen window. A rusty&#160;old swing set&#160;<br/>stood under an apple tree.&#160;<br/>
I couldn't imagine living in&#160;a house like this, with an actual yard and everything. I'd lived in a tiny&#160;<br/>
apartment or a school dorm&#160;my&#160;whole life. If this was&#160;Luke's home, I wondered why he'd&#160;ever wanted to&#160;<br/>leave.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary staggered. I&#160;remembered&#160;what Nico had said about shadow travel draining her, so&#160;I&#160;<br/>
slipped off her back. She let out a huge toothy&#160;yawn that&#160;would've scared&#160;a T. rex, then turned&#160;in a circle&#160;<br/>and flopped down so hard the ground shook.&#160;<br/>
Nico appeared&#160;right next to me, as if the shadows&#160;had darkened and created him.&#160;He&#160;stumbled, but I&#160;<br/>
caught his arm.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;okay,&#34; he&#160;managed, rubbing&#160;his eyes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;How did&#160;you do that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Practice. A few times running into walls. A few accidental trips to&#160;China.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary started&#160;snoring. If it hadn't been for the roar of traffic behind us, I'm sure she would've&#160;<br/>
woken up the whole neighborhood.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you going to take a nap too?&#34; I asked Nico.&#160;<br/>
He shook his&#160;head. &#34;The first time&#160;I&#160;shadow traveled, I&#160;passed&#160;out for a&#160;week.&#160;Now it just&#160;makes&#160;me&#160;a&#160;<br/>
little drowsy,&#160;but I can't&#160;do&#160;it more than&#160;once or twice a night. Mrs. O'Leary&#160;won't be going anywhere for&#160;<br/>a while.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So we've got some quality time in Connecticut.&#34; I&#160;gazed at the white Colonial house. &#34;What now?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We ring the&#160;doorbell,&#34;&#160;Nico said.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
If I were Luke's&#160;mom, I would not&#160;have opened my&#160;door at&#160;night for&#160;two strange kids.&#160;But I wasn't&#160;<br/>
<i>anything&#160;</i>like Luke's&#160;mom.&#160;<br/>
I knew that&#160;even before we reached the front door.&#160;The sidewalk&#160;was lined with those little stuffed&#160;<br/>
beanbag animals you see in gift shops. There were&#160;miniature lions, pigs, dragons, hydras, even a teeny&#160;<br/>Minotaur in&#160;a&#160;little Minotaur diaper. Judging from&#160;their sad shape,&#160;the beanbag creatures had been sitting&#160;<br/>out here a long time—since the&#160;snow&#160;melted last&#160;spring at least. One of the&#160;hydras had a&#160;tree&#160;sapling&#160;<br/>sprouting between its necks.&#160;<br/>
The front porch was infested with wind chimes. Shiny&#160;bits of glass and&#160;metal&#160;clinked in the breeze.&#160;<br/>
Brass ribbons tinkled like&#160;water and made me realize&#160;I needed to&#160;use the bathroom. I didn't know&#160;how&#160;<br/>Ms. Castellan could stand all the noise.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=45></a>The front door was painted turquoise. The name&#160;CASTELLAN&#160;was written in English, and below in&#160;<br/>
Greek:&#160;Διοικητής&#160;φρουρίου<b>.</b>&#160;<br/>
Nico looked&#160;at&#160;me. &#34;Ready?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He'd&#160;barely&#160;tapped the door&#160;when it swung open.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke!&#34; the old lady&#160;cried&#160;happily.&#160;<br/>
She looked like someone&#160;who enjoyed&#160;sticking her fingers in electrical sockets. Her white hair stuck&#160;<br/>
out in tufts all over her head. Her pink housedress was covered in scorch&#160;marks&#160;and smears of ash. When&#160;<br/>she smiled, her face looked unnaturally stretched, and the high-voltage&#160;light&#160;in&#160;her&#160;eves made me&#160;wonder&#160;<br/>if she was blind.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, my&#160;dear boy!&#34; She hugged Nico.&#160;I was trying&#160;to figure out&#160;why&#160;she thought Nico was Luke&#160;<br/>
(they&#160;looked absolutely&#160;nothing&#160;alike), when she smiled at&#160;me&#160;and said, &#34;Luke!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She forgot all about Nico and gave&#160;me&#160;a hug. She smelled like burned cookies. She was as thin as a&#160;<br/>
scarecrow, but that didn't stop her from&#160;almost crushing me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come in!&#34; she insisted. &#34;I have&#160;your lunch ready!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She ushered&#160;us inside. The living room&#160;was&#160;even&#160;weirder than&#160;the front lawn. Mirrors and candles&#160;<br/>
filled every&#160;available space. I couldn't look anywhere without seeing my&#160;own reflection.&#160;Above the&#160;<br/>mantel, a little bronze Hermes&#160;flew&#160;around the second hand&#160;of a&#160;ticking clock. I tried to imagine the god&#160;<br/>of messengers ever falling in love with this old woman, but&#160;the idea&#160;was too bizarre.&#160;<br/>
Then I noticed the framed&#160;picture on the&#160;mantel, and I froze. It was exactly&#160;like Rachel's&#160;sketch—<br/>
Luke around&#160;nine&#160;years old, with blond hair and a&#160;big smile and two&#160;missing teeth. The lack of a scar on&#160;<br/>his face&#160;made&#160;him look like a different person—carefree and happy. How could Rachel have&#160;known about&#160;<br/>that picture?&#160;<br/>
&#34;This way,&#160;my&#160;dear!&#34; Ms. Castellan steered&#160;me&#160;toward the back of the house.&#160;&#34;Oh, I told them&#160;you&#160;<br/>
would come&#160;back. I knew it!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She sat us down at the kitchen table. Stacked on the counter were hundreds—I mean hundreds—of&#160;<br/>
Tupperware boxes with peanut butter and jelly&#160;sandwiches inside. The ones on the bottom&#160;were green and&#160;<br/>fuzzy, like they'd been there for a long time. The smell reminded me of my&#160;sixth grade locker—and that's&#160;<br/>not a good thing.&#160;<br/>
On top of the&#160;oven was a&#160;stack of cookie sheets. Each one had a&#160;dozen burned&#160;cookies on it. In the&#160;<br/>
sink was a&#160;mountain of empty&#160;plastic Kool-Aid pitchers. A beanbag Medusa sat&#160;by&#160;the faucet like she was&#160;<br/>guarding the&#160;mess.&#160;<br/>
Ms. Castellan started humming as she got out peanut butter and jelly&#160;and&#160;started&#160;making a new&#160;<br/>
sandwich. Something was&#160;burning&#160;in&#160;the oven. I&#160;got the feeling more cookies were on the way.&#160;<br/>
Above the sink, taped all around the window, were&#160;dozens of little pictures&#160;cut from&#160;magazines and&#160;<br/>
newspaper ads—pictures&#160;of Hermes from&#160;the FTD&#160;Flowers logo and Quickie Cleaners, pictures of the&#160;<br/>caduceus from&#160;medical ads.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;heart sank. I wanted to get out of that room,&#160;but Ms. Castellan kept smiling at&#160;me&#160;as she&#160;made the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=46></a>sandwich, like she was&#160;making sure I didn't bolt.&#160;<br/>
Nico coughed.&#160;&#34;Urn, Ms. Castellan?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mm?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We need to&#160;ask you about&#160;your son.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh,&#160;yes! They told&#160;me&#160;he would&#160;never come&#160;back. But I knew better.&#34; She patted&#160;my&#160;cheek&#160;<br/>
affectionately, giving&#160;me&#160;peanut butter racing stripes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;When did&#160;you last see him?&#34; Nico asked.&#160;<br/>
Her eyes lost focus.&#160;<br/>
&#34;He was so young when he&#160;left,&#34;&#160;she said wistfully.&#160;&#34;Third grade.&#160;That's too young to run away! He&#160;<br/>
said he'd&#160;be&#160;back for lunch. And I waited. He likes&#160;peanut butter&#160;sandwiches&#160;and cookies and Kool-Aid.&#160;<br/>He'll be back&#160;for lunch&#160;very&#160;soon. .&#160;. .&#34;&#160;Then she looked at me&#160;and smiled. &#34;Why, Luke, there you are!&#160;<br/>You look&#160;so&#160;handsome. You have&#160;your&#160;father's eyes.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She turned toward the pictures of Hermes above the&#160;sink. &#34;Now, there's a good&#160;man. Yes, indeed. He&#160;<br/>
comes to visit me, you know.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The clock kept ticking in&#160;the other room.&#160;I wiped the peanut butter off&#160;my&#160;face and looked at Nico&#160;<br/>
pleadingly,&#160;like&#160;<i>Can we get out of here now?</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ma'am,&#34; Nico said. &#34;What,&#160;uh .&#160;. . what&#160;happened to&#160;your eyes?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her gaze seemed fractured—like she was trying&#160;to&#160;focus on him&#160;through a kaleidoscope. &#34;Why, Luke,&#160;<br/>
you know the story.&#160;It was right before you were born,&#160;wasn't&#160;it? I'd always&#160;been special, able to see&#160;<br/>through the .&#160;. . whatever-they-call-it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The Mist?&#34;&#160;I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, dear.&#34;&#160;She nodded encouragingly.&#160;&#34;And they&#160;offered&#160;me an important job. That's&#160;how special&#160;I&#160;<br/>
was!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I glanced at Nico, but he looked as confused as I was.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What sort of job?&#34; I asked. &#34;What happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ms. Castellan&#160;frowned. Her knife&#160;hovered over the&#160;sandwich bread. &#34;Dear me,&#160;it&#160;didn't&#160;work&#160;out,&#160;did&#160;<br/>
it? Your father warned&#160;me not to try.&#160;He said it was&#160;too dangerous. But I had to. It was&#160;my&#160;destiny!&#160;And&#160;<br/>now . .&#160;. I still can't&#160;get the images out of&#160;my&#160;head. They make everything&#160;seem&#160;so fuzzy.&#160;Would&#160;you like&#160;<br/>some&#160;cookies?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She pulled a tray&#160;out of&#160;the oven and&#160;dumped a dozen&#160;lumps of chocolate chip charcoal on the table.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke was so&#160;kind,&#34; Ms. Castellan&#160;murmured. &#34;He&#160;left&#160;to protect&#160;me, you know. He said if he went&#160;<br/>
away, the monsters wouldn't threaten me. But I told&#160;him&#160;the&#160;monsters are no threat! They&#160;sit outside on&#160;<br/>the sidewalk&#160;all day,&#160;and they&#160;never&#160;come&#160;in.&#34;&#160;She picked&#160;up the little stuffed Medusa from&#160;the&#160;<br/>windowsill. &#34;Do they, Mrs.&#160;Medusa? No, no threat&#160;at&#160;all.&#34; She beamed at me. &#34;I'm&#160;so glad&#160;you came&#160;<br/>home. I knew&#160;you weren't ashamed of me!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I shifted in&#160;my&#160;seat. I imagined being Luke sitting at this&#160;table, eight&#160;or nine&#160;years old, and just&#160;<br/>
beginning to&#160;realize that&#160;my mother wasn't all there.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=47></a>&#34;Ms. Castellan,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mom,&#34; she corrected.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;yeah. Have you seen Luke since he left home?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, of course!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't know if she was imagining that&#160;or not.&#160;For&#160;all I knew, every&#160;time the mailman came to the&#160;<br/>
door he was Luke. But Nico sat forward expectantly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;When?&#34;&#160;he asked. &#34;When&#160;did Luke visit&#160;you last?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, it was . .&#160;. Oh&#160;goodness . . .&#34; A shadow passed&#160;across her&#160;face. &#34;The last time, he looked so&#160;<br/>
different. A scar. A terrible&#160;scar, and his voice so full&#160;of pain .&#160;. .&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;His eyes,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Were they&#160;gold?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Gold?&#34;&#160;She&#160;blinked.&#160;&#34;No. How silly. Luke has blue&#160;eyes. Beautiful blue eyes!&#34;&#160;<br/>
So Luke really&#160;had been here, and this had happened before last&#160;summer—before he'd&#160;turned into&#160;<br/>
Kronos.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ms. Castellan?&#34; Nico put&#160;his hand on the old woman's arm. &#34;This is very&#160;important. Did he&#160;ask you&#160;<br/>
for anything?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She frowned as if trying to remember. &#34;My—my&#160;blessing. Isn't that sweet?&#34; She looked at us&#160;<br/>
uncertainly. &#34;He was going to a river,&#160;and he said he&#160;needed&#160;my&#160;blessing. I gave it to him.&#160;Of course&#160;I&#160;<br/>did.&#34; &#160;<br/>
Nico looked&#160;at&#160;me&#160;triumphantly. &#34;Thank&#160;you, ma'am. That's&#160;all the information we—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ms. Castellan&#160;gasped. She&#160;doubled over, and her&#160;cookie&#160;tray&#160;clattered to the floor. Nico&#160;and I&#160;jumped&#160;<br/>
to our feet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ms. Castellan?&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;AHHHH,&#34;&#160;&#160;</i>She straightened. I scrambled away&#160;and almost fell&#160;over the kitchen table, because her&#160;<br/>
eyes—her eyes were&#160;glowing green.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;My child,&#34;&#160;</i>she rasped in a&#160;much deeper voice.&#160;<i>&#34;Must protect him! Hermes, help! Not my child! Not&#160;</i><br/>
<i>his fate</i>—<i>no!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
She grabbed Nico by&#160;the shoulders and began&#160;to shake him&#160;as if&#160;to&#160;make him&#160;understand.&#160;<i>&#34;Not his&#160;</i><br/>
<i>fate!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
Nico&#160;made a strangled scream&#160;and pushed her away.&#160;He gripped the hilt&#160;of his sword. &#34;Percy, we&#160;<br/>
need to get out—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Suddenly Ms. Castellan collapsed. I lurched forward&#160;and caught her before she could hit&#160;the&#160;edge of&#160;<br/>
the table. I managed to get&#160;her into a chair.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ms. C?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
She&#160;muttered&#160;something incomprehensible and&#160;shook her head. &#34;Goodness. I . . . I dropped the&#160;<br/>
cookies. How silly of me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She blinked,&#160;and her eyes were back to normal—or&#160;at least, what&#160;they&#160;had&#160;been before. The green&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=48></a>glow was gone.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you okay?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, of course, dear. I'm&#160;fine. Why&#160;do&#160;you ask?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I glanced at Nico, who mouthed the word&#160;<i>Leave.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ms. C,&#160;you&#160;were telling us something,&#34; I said. &#34;Something about&#160;your son.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Was I?&#34; she said dreamily. &#34;Yes, his blue eyes.&#160;We were talking about his blue&#160;eyes. Such&#160;a&#160;<br/>
handsome boy!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to&#160;go,&#34; Nico said urgently. &#34;We'll tell Luke . . . uh, we'll tell him&#160;you&#160;said hello.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But&#160;you can't leave!&#34; Ms. Castellan got shakily&#160;to<i>&#160;&#160;</i>her feet, and I backed away. I felt silly being&#160;<br/>
scared of a frail old woman, but the way her voice&#160;had changed, the way&#160;she'd grabbed Nico . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hermes will&#160;be here soon,&#34; she promised. &#34;He'll want&#160;to see his boy!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maybe next&#160;time,&#34; I&#160;said.&#160;&#34;Thank you&#160;for—&#34; I looked down at the burned cookies scattered on the&#160;<br/>
floor. &#34;Thanks&#160;for everything.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She tried to stop us,&#160;to&#160;offer us Kool-Aid, but I had&#160;to get out of&#160;that house. On&#160;the front porch, she&#160;<br/>
grabbed my&#160;wrist and I almost jumped out of my&#160;skin. &#34;Luke, at least be safe.&#160;Promise&#160;me you'll be safe.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will . . . Mom.&#34;&#160;<br/>
That&#160;made her smile. She released&#160;my&#160;wrist, and&#160;as&#160;she closed the front door I could hear her talking&#160;<br/>
to the candles: &#34;You hear that? He will&#160;be safe. I told&#160;you&#160;he would be!&#34;&#160;<br/>
As the door shut, Nico and I ran. The little beanbag&#160;animals on the sidewalk&#160;seemed to grin at us as&#160;<br/>
we passed.&#160;<br/>
Back at the cliff, Mrs. O'Leary&#160;had found a friend.&#160;<br/>
A cozy&#160;campfire crackled in a ring of stones. A girl about eight&#160;years old was&#160;sitting cross-legged&#160;<br/>
next to Mrs.&#160;O'Leary,&#160;scratching the hellhound's ears.&#160;<br/>
The girl had mousy&#160;brown hair and a&#160;simple brown dress. She&#160;wore a&#160;scarf&#160;over her head&#160;so she&#160;<br/>
looked like a pioneer kid—like the ghost&#160;of&#160;<i>Little House on the Prairie&#160;</i>or something. She poked the fire&#160;<br/>with a stick, and it seemed to glow more richly red than&#160;a normal fire.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hello,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;first thought was:&#160;monster. When you're a demigod and&#160;you find a sweet little girl alone in the&#160;<br/>
woods—that's typically&#160;a good time to draw your&#160;sword and&#160;attack. Plus, the encounter with Ms.&#160;<br/>Castellan had rattled&#160;me&#160;pretty&#160;bad.&#160;<br/>
But Nico bowed to the little girl. &#34;Hello again, Lady.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She studied&#160;me with eyes as red as the firelight. I decided it was safest to bow.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sit, Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34; she said. &#34;Would&#160;you like some dinner?&#160;<br/>
After staring at&#160;moldy&#160;peanut butter sandwiches&#160;and burned cookies, I didn't&#160;have&#160;much of an&#160;<br/>
appetite, but&#160;the girl waved her hand and a picnic appeared at the edge of the&#160;fire. There were plates of&#160;<br/>roast beef, baked potatoes,&#160;buttered carrots, fresh bread, and a whole bunch of&#160;other foods I&#160;hadn't had in&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=49></a>a long time. My stomach started to rumble. It was the kind&#160;of<i>&#160;</i>home-cooked&#160;meal people are supposed to&#160;<br/>have but never do. The girl made&#160;a five-foot-long dog&#160;biscuit appear for Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;who happily&#160;began&#160;<br/>tearing it to shreds.&#160;<br/>
I sat next to&#160;Nico. We picked up&#160;our food,<i>&#160;</i>and I&#160;was about to&#160;dig in&#160;when I thought better of it.&#160;<br/>
I scraped part&#160;of my&#160;meal into the flames, the way&#160;we do at camp. &#34;For the gods,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
The little girl&#160;smiled. &#34;Thank&#160;you. As tender of the flame, I get a share of every&#160;sacrifice, you know.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I recognize you now,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;The first time&#160;I&#160;came to camp, you were sitting by&#160;the fire, in the&#160;<br/>
middle of the&#160;commons area.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You did not&#160;stop to talk,&#34;&#160;the girl recalled sadly. &#34;Alas,&#160;most never do. Nico talked to me. He was&#160;<br/>
the first in many&#160;years. Everyone rushes about. No time for visiting&#160;family.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're Hestia,&#34; I said. &#34;Goddess of the&#160;Hearth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She nodded.&#160;<br/>
Okay&#160;.&#160;. . so&#160;she looked eight&#160;years old.&#160;I didn't ask. I'd learned that gods could look&#160;any&#160;way&#160;they&#160;<br/>
pleased.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My lady,&#34; Nico asked, &#34;why&#160;aren't you&#160;with the other&#160;Olympians, fighting Typhon?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm not&#160;much for fighting.&#34; Her red eyes flickered.&#160;I&#160;realized they weren't&#160;just&#160;reflecting the&#160;flames.&#160;<br/>
They&#160;were filled with flames—but not like Ares's&#160;eyes. Hestia's eyes were&#160;warm&#160;and cozy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Besides,&#34; she said, &#34;someone has to keep the home fires burning&#160;while the other gods are away.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So&#160;you're guarding Mount&#160;Olympus?&#34; I&#160;asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;'Guard'&#160;may&#160;be too strong&#160;a word. But if&#160;you ever&#160;need a warm&#160;place to sit and a home-cooked meal,&#160;<br/>
you are welcome to visit.&#160;Now eat.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;plate was empty&#160;before&#160;I knew it. Nico scarfed his down just as&#160;fast.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That was great,&#34; I said. &#34;Thank&#160;you, Hestia.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She nodded.&#160;&#34;Did&#160;you&#160;have&#160;a good visit with May Castellan?&#34;&#160;<br/>
For a moment&#160;I'd almost forgotten the old lady&#160;with&#160;her bright eyes and her maniacal smile, the way&#160;<br/>
she'd suddenly seemed possessed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's wrong with her, exactly?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;She was born with a gift,&#34; Hestia said. &#34;She could see through the&#160;Mist.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like my&#160;mother,&#34; I said.&#160;And I was also&#160;thinking,&#160;<i>Like Rachel&#160;</i>&#34;But the glowing eyes thing—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Some bear the curse of sight better than&#160;others,&#34;&#160;the goddess said sadly. &#34;For a while, May&#160;Castellan&#160;<br/>
had&#160;many&#160;talents. She attracted the attention of Hermes&#160;himself.&#160;They&#160;had a beautiful baby boy.&#160;For a&#160;<br/>brief time, she was happy.&#160;And then she&#160;went too far.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I remembered&#160;what Ms.&#160;Castellan had&#160;said:&#160;<i>They offered me an important job . .&#160;. It didn't work out.&#160;</i>I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=50></a>wondered what kind of&#160;job&#160;left you like that.&#160;<br/>
&#34;One&#160;minute she was&#160;all happy,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;And then&#160;she was freaking out&#160;about&#160;her son's fate, like she&#160;<br/>
knew he'd&#160;turned into Kronos. What happened to .&#160;. . to&#160;divide her like that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The goddess's face darkened. &#34;That is a story&#160;I do not like to tell. But May&#160;Castellan saw too much. If&#160;<br/>
you are to understand your&#160;enemy&#160;Luke,&#160;you must understand his family.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought about the sad little pictures of&#160;Hermes taped&#160;above May&#160;Castellan's sink. I wondered if Ms.&#160;<br/>
Castellan had been so crazy&#160;when Luke&#160;was little. That green-eyed fit could've seriously&#160;scared a nine-<br/>year-old&#160;kid.&#160;And if Hermes never&#160;visited, if he'd&#160;left Luke alone with his mom&#160;all those&#160;years . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;No wonder&#160;Luke ran away,&#34; I said. &#34;I&#160;mean, it wasn't&#160;right to leave his&#160;mom&#160;like that, but&#160;still—he&#160;<br/>
was just a kid. Hermes shouldn't have abandoned them.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hestia scratched behind&#160;Mrs. O'Leary's ears. The hellhound wagged her tail&#160;and accidentally knocked&#160;<br/>
over a tree.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's easy&#160;to judge others,&#34; Hestia&#160;warned. &#34;But&#160;will&#160;you follow Luke's&#160;path? Seek the same&#160;powers?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico set down his plate. &#34;We have no choice, my&#160;lady. It's&#160;the only way&#160;Percy&#160;stands a chance.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mmm.&#34; Hestia opened her hand and the fire roared.&#160;Flames&#160;shot thirty&#160;feet into the air. Heat&#160;slapped&#160;<br/>
me in the face. Then the fire died back down to&#160;normal.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not all powers are spectacular.&#34; Hestia looked at&#160;me. &#34;Sometimes the hardest power to&#160;master is the&#160;<br/>
power&#160;of yielding.&#160;Do&#160;you believe&#160;me?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Uh-huh,&#34;&#160;I said. Anything&#160;to keep her from&#160;messing with her flame powers again.&#160;<br/>
The goddess smiled. &#34;You&#160;are&#160;a good hero, Percy&#160;Jackson. Not too proud. I like that. But you have&#160;<br/>
much to learn. When Dionysus was&#160;made a god, I gave up my&#160;throne for him.&#160;It was the only&#160;way&#160;to&#160;<br/>avoid a civil&#160;war among the gods.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It unbalanced the Council,&#34; I remembered. &#34;Suddenly there were seven guys&#160;and five girls.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hestia&#160;shrugged. &#34;It was the best solution, not a perfect one. Now I tend the fire. I fade slowly into the&#160;<br/>
background. No one will ever write epic poems&#160;about&#160;the deeds of&#160;Hestia. Most&#160;demigods don't even&#160;stop&#160;<br/>to talk to me. But that is no matter. I keep&#160;the peace. I yield when necessary.&#160;Can&#160;you&#160;do this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know what you mean.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She studied&#160;me. &#34;Perhaps&#160;not&#160;yet. But&#160;soon. Will&#160;you&#160;continue&#160;your quest?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is that why&#160;you're here—to warn me against going?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hestia shook her head. &#34;I&#160;am&#160;here because when all else fails, when all the other&#160;mighty gods have&#160;<br/>
gone off&#160;to&#160;war, I am&#160;all that's left. Home. Hearth.&#160;I am&#160;the last Olympian. You&#160;must remember&#160;me&#160;when&#160;<br/>you face&#160;your&#160;final decision.&#160;<br/>
I didn't like the way&#160;she said&#160;<i>final.</i>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=51></a>I looked at Nico, then back at Hestia's&#160;warm glowing eyes. &#34;I have to continue,&#160;my&#160;lady. I have to&#160;<br/>
stop Luke .&#160;. .&#160;I mean Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hestia nodded. &#34;Very&#160;well. I cannot be of much assistance, beyond&#160;what I have&#160;already&#160;told&#160;you. But&#160;<br/>
since you sacrificed to me, I can return you to&#160;your&#160;own hearth. I&#160;will see you again, Percy,&#160;on Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her tone was&#160;ominous, as though our next meeting would&#160;not be&#160;happy.&#160;<br/>
The goddess waved her hand,&#160;and everything faded.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Suddenly I was home. Nico and I were sitting on the couch in my&#160;mom's apartment on the&#160;Upper East&#160;<br/>Side. That was the good&#160;news. The bad news was that the rest of<i>&#160;</i>the living room&#160;was occupied by&#160;Mrs.&#160;<br/>O'Leary.&#160;<br/>
I heard a&#160;muffled yell from the bedroom. Paul's&#160;voice&#160;said, &#34;Who put this wall of&#160;fur in the doorway?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy?&#34; my&#160;mom called out. &#34;Are&#160;you&#160;here? Are you all right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;here!&#34; I shouted back.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;WOOF!&#34;&#160;&#160;</i>Mrs. O'Leary&#160;tried to turn in a&#160;circle to&#160;find my&#160;mom,&#160;knocking all&#160;the pictures&#160;off the&#160;<br/>
walls. She's only&#160;met&#160;my&#160;mom once before (long story),&#160;but she loves her.&#160;<br/>
It took a few&#160;minutes, but&#160;we finally&#160;got things worked out. After&#160;destroying most of the furniture in&#160;<br/>
the living room&#160;and probably&#160;making our neighbors&#160;really&#160;mad,&#160;we got&#160;my&#160;parents out of the bedroom&#160;<br/>and into&#160;the&#160;kitchen, where we sat around the kitchen table. Mrs.&#160;O'Leary&#160;still took&#160;up the entire living&#160;<br/>room, but she'd&#160;settled her head in the&#160;kitchen doorway&#160;so she could see us,&#160;which&#160;made&#160;her happy. My&#160;<br/>mom tossed&#160;her a ten-pound family-size tube of ground beef, which disappeared down her gullet. Paul&#160;<br/>poured lemonade for the rest of us while&#160;I explained about&#160;our visit&#160;to Connecticut.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So it's true.&#34; Paul stared at me like he'd never&#160;seen me before. He&#160;was wearing his white bathrobe,&#160;<br/>
now covered in hellhound&#160;fur, and&#160;his&#160;salt-and-pepper&#160;hair was sticking up&#160;in&#160;every&#160;direction. &#34;All the&#160;<br/>talk about monsters, and being a&#160;demigod . . .&#160;it's really true.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded. Last fall I'd explained to Paul who I&#160;was. My&#160;mom&#160;had backed me up. But until this&#160;<br/>
moment, I don't think he really&#160;believed us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sorry&#160;about&#160;Mrs. O'Leary,&#34; I said,&#160;&#34;destroying&#160;the living room&#160;and all.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Paul laughed&#160;like he was delighted. &#34;Are you kidding?&#160;This is awesome! I&#160;mean, when I saw the&#160;<br/>
hoofprints on&#160;the Prius, I thought maybe. But this!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He patted&#160;Mrs. O'Leary's snout. The living room&#160;shook—<i>BOOM, BOOM,&#160;BOOM</i>—which either&#160;<br/>
meant a SWAT team&#160;was&#160;breaking down the door or&#160;Mrs. O'Leary&#160;was wagging&#160;her tail.&#160;<br/>
I couldn't help but smile. Paul was&#160;a pretty&#160;cool guy, even if<i>&#160;</i>he was&#160;my&#160;English teacher&#160;as&#160;well&#160;as&#160;my&#160;<br/>
stepdad.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks for not freaking out,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=52></a>&#34;Oh,&#160;I'm&#160;freaking out,&#34; he promised,&#160;his&#160;eyes wide. &#34;I just think it's awesome!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah, well,&#34;&#160;I said, &#34;you&#160;may&#160;not&#160;be so excited when&#160;you&#160;hear what's happening.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I told Paul and my&#160;mom&#160;about Typhon,&#160;and the&#160;gods,&#160;and the&#160;battle that was sure to come. Then I told&#160;<br/>
them&#160;Nico's plan.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;mom&#160;laced her fingers around her lemonade glass.&#160;She was wearing her old blue flannel bathrobe,&#160;<br/>
and her hair was tied<i>&#160;</i>back. Recently&#160;she'd started writing a novel, like she'd wanted to do<i>&#160;</i>for years, and I&#160;<br/>could tell she'd been working on it late into the night, because the&#160;circles under&#160;her eyes were darker than&#160;<br/>usual.&#160;<br/>
Behind her at&#160;the kitchen window, silvery moon lace glowed in the flower&#160;box. I'd brought the&#160;<br/>
magical plant back from&#160;Calypso's island last summer,&#160;and it bloomed like crazy under my&#160;mother's care.&#160;<br/>The scent always&#160;calmed&#160;me down, but it also&#160;made&#160;me sad because&#160;it reminded me of lost friends.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;mom&#160;took a deep breath, like she was thinking&#160;how&#160;to tell me no.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, it's dangerous,&#34; she&#160;said. &#34;Even for&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mom,&#160;I know. I could die.&#160;Nico explained that. But&#160;if we don't try—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll&#160;all die,&#34; Nico said. He hadn't touched his lemonade. &#34;Ms.&#160;Jackson, we&#160;don't stand a chance&#160;<br/>
against an invasion. And there&#160;<i>will&#160;</i>be an invasion.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;An invasion of New York?&#34;&#160;Paul said. &#34;Is that&#160;even possible?&#160;How could we not see the . . . the&#160;<br/>
monsters?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He said the word like he still couldn't believe this was&#160;real.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know,&#34; I admitted. &#34;I don't see how Kronos&#160;could just march into Manhattan, but&#160;the Mist is&#160;<br/>
strong. Typhon is trampling across the country&#160;right&#160;now, and mortals think he's&#160;a storm&#160;system.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ms. Jackson,&#34; Nico said,&#160;&#34;Percy&#160;needs your blessing. The process&#160;<i>has&#160;</i>to start that way.&#160;I wasn't sure&#160;<br/>
until we met&#160;Luke's&#160;mom,&#160;but now I'm&#160;positive. This&#160;has only been done successfully&#160;twice&#160;before. Both&#160;<br/>times, the&#160;mother had to&#160;give her blessing. She had to&#160;be willing to&#160;let her son take the risk.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You want me to bless this?&#34;&#160;She shook&#160;her head. &#34;It's&#160;crazy. Percy,&#160;please—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mom,&#160;I can't&#160;do it without&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And if&#160;you survive this .&#160;.&#160;. this&#160;<i>process?&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then I go to&#160;war,&#34; I said. &#34;Me against&#160;Kronos. And&#160;only&#160;one of us&#160;will survive.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't tell her the whole&#160;prophecy—about&#160;the soul&#160;reaping and the end of&#160;my&#160;days. She&#160;didn't need&#160;<br/>
to know that&#160;I was probably doomed. I could&#160;only&#160;hope I'd stop&#160;Kronos and save the rest of the world&#160;<br/>before I died.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're&#160;my&#160;son,&#34; she said&#160;miserably.&#160;&#34;I&#160;can't just . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I could tell I'd have to push her harder if I wanted&#160;her to agree,&#160;but I didn't&#160;want to. I remembered&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=53></a>poor Ms. Castellan in her kitchen,&#160;waiting for her son&#160;to come&#160;home. And I realized how lucky&#160;I was. My&#160;<br/>mom had&#160;always&#160;been there for&#160;me,&#160;always&#160;tried to&#160;make things&#160;normal for&#160;me, even&#160;with&#160;the gods and&#160;<br/>monsters and&#160;stuff. She put up with me&#160;going&#160;off on&#160;adventures, but now I was asking her blessing to&#160;do&#160;<br/>something that would probably get me&#160;killed.&#160;<br/>
I locked eyes with Paul, and some&#160;kind of understanding passed between us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sally.&#34;&#160;He put his hand over&#160;my&#160;mother's hands.&#160;&#34;I can't&#160;claim to know what you and Percy&#160;have&#160;<br/>
been going through all these years. But it sounds to me&#160;. . . it sounds like Percy&#160;is&#160;doing something noble.&#160;<br/>I wish I had that much courage.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I got a lump&#160;in my&#160;throat. I&#160;didn't get compliments like that too much.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;mom&#160;stared at her lemonade. She looked like she was trying&#160;not to cry.&#160;I thought about what&#160;<br/>
Hestia had said, about&#160;how&#160;hard it was to&#160;yield, and I&#160;figured maybe&#160;my&#160;mom&#160;was finding that&#160;out.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; she said, &#34;I give&#160;you my&#160;blessing.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't feel any&#160;different.&#160;No magic glow lit the kitchen or anything.&#160;<br/>
I glanced at Nico.&#160;<br/>
He looked more anxious than ever, but&#160;he nodded.&#160;&#34;It's time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; my&#160;mom&#160;said. &#34;One last thing. If&#160;you . . . if<i>&#160;</i>you survive this fight&#160;with Kronos,&#160;send me&#160;a&#160;<br/>
sign.&#34; She rummaged through&#160;her purse and handed&#160;me her cell phone.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mom,&#34; I said, &#34;you know&#160;demigods and phones—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know,&#34; she said. &#34;But just in case. If&#160;you're not able to call . . .&#160;maybe a sign that I could see from&#160;<br/>
anywhere in&#160;Manhattan. To let me know you're okay.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like Theseus,&#34; Paul suggested. &#34;He was supposed to&#160;raise white sails&#160;when he came home&#160;to&#160;<br/>
Athens.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Except he forgot,&#34; Nico muttered. &#34;And his father&#160;jumped off the palace roof in despair.&#160;But other&#160;<br/>
than that, it was a great idea.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What about&#160;a flag or a flare?&#34; my&#160;mom said. &#34;From&#160;Olympus—the Empire State Building.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Something blue,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
We'd&#160;had a running joke for years about&#160;blue food. It&#160;was&#160;my&#160;favorite color, and&#160;my&#160;mom&#160;went&#160;out of&#160;<br/>
her way&#160;to humor&#160;me. Every&#160;year my&#160;birthday&#160;cake,&#160;my&#160;Easter basket,&#160;my&#160;Christmas candy&#160;canes&#160;always&#160;<br/>had to be&#160;blue.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#34;&#160;my&#160;mom&#160;agreed. &#34;I'll watch for a blue signal.&#160;And I'll try&#160;to avoid jumping off palace roofs.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She gave&#160;me&#160;one last hug. I tried not to feel like I&#160;was&#160;saying good-bye. I shook hands with Paul.&#160;<br/>
Then Nico and I walked to&#160;the kitchen doorway&#160;and looked at Mrs.&#160;O'Leary.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sorry, girl,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Shadow travel time again.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=54></a>She whimpered and crossed her paws over her snout.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Where now?&#34; I asked Nico. &#34;Los Angeles?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No need,&#34; he said. &#34;There's&#160;a closer entrance to the Underworld.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
SEVEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
MY &#160;MATH &#160;TEACHER&#160;<br/>
GIVES &#160;ME &#160;A &#160;LIFT&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
We emerged in Central Park just north&#160;of&#160;the Pond.&#160;Mrs. O'Leary&#160;looked pretty&#160;tired as she limped over to&#160;<br/>a cluster of boulders. She&#160;started sniffing around, and&#160;I&#160;was afraid she&#160;might&#160;mark her territory, but Nico&#160;<br/>said, &#34;It's okay. She just smells the way home.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I frowned. &#34;Through the rocks?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The Underworld has two&#160;major entrances,&#34; Nico said.&#160;&#34;You know&#160;the one in L.A.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Charon's ferry.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico nodded.&#160;&#34;Most souls go that way, but there's&#160;a smaller path, harder to find. The Door of&#160;<br/>
Orpheus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The dude with the harp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dude with the lyre,&#34; Nico corrected. &#34;But&#160;yeah, him.&#160;He&#160;used his&#160;music to charm&#160;the earth&#160;and&#160;open&#160;<br/>
a new path into the Underworld. He sang his way&#160;right&#160;into Hades's palace&#160;and almost got away&#160;with his&#160;<br/>wife's&#160;soul.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I remembered the story.&#160;Orpheus&#160;wasn't&#160;supposed&#160;to look behind&#160;him when&#160;he was leading his wife&#160;<br/>
back to the world, but of course he did.&#160;It was one&#160;of&#160;those typical &#34;and-so-they-died/the-end&#34;&#160;stories that&#160;<br/>always&#160;made&#160;us feel warm&#160;and fuzzy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So this is the Door of Orpheus.&#34; I tried to be impressed, but it still looked like a pile of rocks to&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;How does it open?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We need&#160;music,&#34; Nico said. &#34;How's your singing?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;no. Can't you just, like, tell it to open? You're the son of Hades and all.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's not so easy. We need&#160;music.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was pretty&#160;sure if I tried to sing, all I would cause was an avalanche.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I have a better idea.&#34; I turned and called, &#34;GROVER!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
We waited for a long time. Mrs. O'Leary&#160;curled up and&#160;took a nap.&#160;I could hear the crickets in the woods&#160;<br/>and an owl hooting.&#160;Traffic hummed along Central Park West. Horse hooves clopped down&#160;a nearby&#160;path,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=55></a>maybe a&#160;mounted police patrol. I was&#160;sure they'd&#160;love&#160;to find two kids hanging&#160;out in the park&#160;at one in&#160;<br/>the morning.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's no good,&#34; Nico said at last.&#160;<br/>
But I had a feeling. My&#160;empathy&#160;link&#160;was really&#160;tingling for the first time in months, which either&#160;<br/>
meant a whole lot of people&#160;had&#160;suddenly switched on&#160;the Nature&#160;Channel, or Grover was close.&#160;<br/>
I shut my&#160;eyes and concentrated.&#160;<i>Grover.</i>&#160;<br/>
I knew he was somewhere&#160;in the park.&#160;Why&#160;couldn't&#160;I sense his emotions?&#160;All I got was a faint hum&#160;<br/>
in the base of my&#160;skull.&#160;<br/>
<i>Grover,&#160;</i>I thought more insistently.&#160;<br/>
<i>Hmm-hmmmm,&#160;</i>something said.&#160;<br/>
An image came into my&#160;head. I&#160;saw a giant elm&#160;tree deep in the&#160;woods, well off the main paths.&#160;<br/>
Gnarled roots laced the ground, making a kind of bed. Lying in&#160;it with his arms crossed and his eyes&#160;<br/>closed was&#160;a&#160;satyr. At first I couldn't be sure it was&#160;Grover. He was covered in twigs and leaves, like he'd&#160;<br/>been sleeping there a long&#160;time. The roots seemed to&#160;be shaping themselves around him,&#160;slowly&#160;pulling&#160;<br/>him&#160;into the earth.&#160;<br/>
<i>Grover,&#160;</i>I said.&#160;<i>Wake up.</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Unnnh</i>—<i>zzzzz.</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Dude, you're&#160;covered in dirt. Wake up!</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Sleepy,&#160;</i>his mind murmured.&#160;<br/>
<i>FOOD,&#160;</i>I suggested.&#160;<i>PANCAKES!</i>&#160;<br/>
His eyes&#160;shot open. A blur of thoughts filled&#160;my&#160;head like he&#160;was&#160;suddenly on fast-forward. The&#160;<br/>
image shattered, and<i>&#160;</i>I almost fell over.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What happened?&#34; Nico asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I got through. He's&#160;. . . yeah. He's on his way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A&#160;minute later, the tree next to<i>&#160;</i>us shivered. Grover fell out of&#160;the branches, right on his head.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Grover!&#34; I&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Woof!&#34;&#160;</i>Mrs.&#160;O'Leary&#160;looked up, probably wondering&#160;if we were<i>&#160;</i>going to&#160;play&#160;fetch with the satyr.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blah-haa-haa!&#34; Grover bleated.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You okay,&#160;man?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, I'm&#160;fine.&#34; He rubbed&#160;his head. His&#160;horns had&#160;grown so much they poked an&#160;inch above his curly&#160;<br/>
hair. &#34;I was at the other end of the park. The dryads&#160;had this great &#160;idea of passing me through the trees to&#160;<br/>get me here.&#160;They&#160;don't understand&#160;<i>height&#160;</i>very&#160;well.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He grinned and got to&#160;his feet—well, his&#160;<i>hooves,&#160;&#160;</i>actually.&#160;Since last summer, Grover had&#160;stopped&#160;<br/>
trying to disguise himself as human. He never&#160;wore a&#160;cap or fake feet anymore. He didn't even&#160;wear&#160;<br/>jeans, since he&#160;had furry&#160;goat legs from the waist down. His T-shirt had a picture from&#160;that book&#160;<i>Where&#160;</i><br/>
<i>the Wild Things Are.&#160;</i>It was covered with dirt and tree sap. His goatee looked fuller, almost&#160;manly&#160;(or&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=56></a>goatly?),&#160;and&#160;he was as tall as&#160;me&#160;now.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good to see you, G-man,&#34; I said. &#34;You&#160;remember Nico.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover nodded at Nico, then he gave me&#160;a big hug. He smelled like&#160;fresh-mown lawns.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Perrrrcy!&#34; he bleated. &#34;I&#160;missed you!&#160;I&#160;miss camp.&#160;They&#160;don't serve very&#160;good enchiladas in the&#160;<br/>
wilderness.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I was worried,&#34; I said. &#34;Where've you been the last two months?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The last two—&#34; Grover's smile faded. &#34;The last&#160;<i>two months?&#160;</i>What&#160;are you talking about?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We haven't&#160;heard from&#160;you,&#34; I said. &#34;Juniper's worried. We sent Iris-messages,&#160;but—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hold on.&#34; He&#160;looked&#160;up&#160;at the stars like he was trying&#160;to calculate his position.&#160;&#34;What&#160;month is&#160;<br/>
this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;August.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The color drained from&#160;his&#160;face. &#34;That's&#160;impossible. It's&#160;June. I just&#160;lay&#160;down to take a nap&#160;and . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
He grabbed my&#160;arms. &#34;I remember now! He knocked me out. Percy,&#160;we have&#160;to stop him!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Whoa,&#34; I said. &#34;Slow down. Tell me&#160;what happened.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He took a deep breath. &#34;I was . . . I was walking in the woods up by&#160;Harlem&#160;Meer. And I felt this&#160;<br/>
tremble in the ground, like something powerful was near.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can sense stuff like that?&#34;&#160;Nico asked.&#160;<br/>
Grover nodded. &#34;Since Pan's death, I can feel when&#160;something is wrong in&#160;nature. It's&#160;like&#160;my&#160;ears&#160;<br/>
and eyes are&#160;sharper when&#160;I'm in the&#160;Wild. Anyway, I started following the&#160;scent. This&#160;man in a long&#160;<br/>black coat was walking through the park, and I&#160;noticed&#160;he didn't&#160;cast a shadow. Middle of&#160;a&#160;sunny&#160;day,&#160;<br/>and he cast no shadow. He kind&#160;of shimmered as&#160;he moved.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like a mirage?&#34;&#160;Nico asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#34; Grover said. &#34;And&#160;whenever he passed humans—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The humans&#160;would pass out,&#34; Nico said. &#34;Curl up and go to sleep.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's right! Then after he was gone, they'd&#160;get&#160;up and&#160;go about their business like nothing&#160;<br/>
happened.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at Nico. &#34;You know this guy&#160;in&#160;black?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Afraid so,&#34; Nico said. &#34;Grover, what happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I followed the guy.&#160;He&#160;kept looking&#160;up at the buildings around the park like he was&#160;making&#160;<br/>
estimates or something. This lady&#160;jogger&#160;ran by, and&#160;she curled up&#160;on the sidewalk and started snoring.&#160;<br/>The guy&#160;in&#160;black put&#160;his hand on&#160;her&#160;forehead like he was checking her temperature. Then he kept&#160;<br/>walking. By&#160;this time, I knew he was&#160;a monster or&#160;something even worse. I followed him&#160;into this grove,&#160;<br/>to the base of a big elm&#160;tree. I was&#160;about to summon&#160;some&#160;dryads to help me&#160;capture him&#160;when he turned&#160;<br/>and . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover swallowed. &#34;Percy, his face. I couldn't make&#160;out his face because it kept shifting. Just&#160;looking&#160;<br/>
at him&#160;made&#160;me&#160;sleepy.&#160;I said, 'What are you doing?'&#160;He said,&#160;'Just having a look around.&#160;You should&#160;<br/>always&#160;scout&#160;a battlefield&#160;before the battle.'&#160;I said something really&#160;smart like,&#160;'This forest is under&#160;my&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=57></a>protection. You won't start any&#160;battles here!'&#160;And&#160;he laughed. He said, 'You're lucky&#160;I'm saving my&#160;<br/>energy&#160;for the&#160;main event, little satyr. I'll just grant&#160;you a short nap. Pleasant dreams.'&#160;And that's the last&#160;<br/>thing I remember.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico exhaled. &#34;Grover,&#160;you&#160;met Morpheus, the God of&#160;Dreams. You're lucky&#160;you&#160;<i>ever&#160;</i>woke up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Two months,&#34; Grover moaned. &#34;He put&#160;me to sleep for two months!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I tried to wrap my&#160;mind around what&#160;this meant.&#160;Now it&#160;made sense why&#160;we hadn't been able to&#160;<br/>
contact Grover all this time.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why&#160;didn't the nymphs try to wake&#160;you?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
Grover shrugged. &#34;Most nymphs aren't&#160;good with time. Two&#160;months for a tree—that's&#160;nothing. They&#160;<br/>
probably didn't think anything was wrong.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We've got to figure out what Morpheus&#160;was doing in&#160;the park,&#34; I said. &#34;I don't like this 'main&#160;event'&#160;<br/>
thing he&#160;mentioned.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He's working for Kronos,&#34;&#160;Nico said. &#34;We know that&#160;already.&#160;A lot of the minor gods are.&#160;This just&#160;<br/>
proves there's going&#160;to&#160;be an invasion.&#160;Percy,&#160;we have to get on&#160;with&#160;our&#160;plan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Wait,&#34; Grover said. &#34;What plan?&#34;&#160;<br/>
We told him,&#160;and Grover started tugging&#160;at his leg fur.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're not serious,&#34; he said. &#34;Not the&#160;Underworld again.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;not asking&#160;you&#160;to come,&#160;man,&#34; I promised. &#34;I know&#160;you just&#160;woke up.&#160;But&#160;we need some&#160;music&#160;<br/>
to open the door. Can&#160;you&#160;do it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover took&#160;out his reed&#160;pipes. &#34;I guess I could&#160;try.&#160;I&#160;know a few&#160;Nirvana tunes that can split rocks.&#160;<br/>
But, Percy,&#160;are you sure&#160;you want to do this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Please,&#160;man,&#34; I said. &#34;It would mean a lot. For&#160;old times'&#160;sake?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He whimpered. &#34;As I recall,&#160;in the old times&#160;we&#160;almost died a lot.&#160;But okay,&#160;here goes nothing.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He put his pipes to his lips and played&#160;a shrill, lively&#160;tune. The boulders trembled. A few&#160;more&#160;<br/>
stanzas, and they&#160;cracked open, revealing a triangular&#160;crevice.&#160;<br/>
I peered inside. Steps led&#160;down into the darkness.&#160;The air smelled of&#160;mildew and death. It brought&#160;<br/>
back bad memories of my&#160;trip through the Labyrinth&#160;last&#160;year, but&#160;this tunnel felt even more dangerous. It&#160;<br/>led straight to the land of Hades, and that was almost always&#160;a one-way&#160;trip.&#160;<br/>
I turned to&#160;Grover. &#34;Thanks . . . I think.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Perrrrcy,&#160;is&#160;Kronos really going to invade?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I wish I could tell&#160;you better, but&#160;yeah.&#160;He will.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought&#160;Grover might chew up&#160;his reed pipes in&#160;anxiety,&#160;but&#160;he straightened up&#160;and brushed&#160;off his&#160;<br/>
T-shirt. I couldn't help thinking&#160;how different he looked from&#160;fat&#160;old Leneus. &#34;I've got to rally&#160;the nature&#160;<br/>spirits, then.&#160;Maybe we can help. I'll see if we can find this Morpheus.'&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Better tell Juniper&#160;you're okay,&#160;too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
His eyes widened. &#34;Juniper! Oh, she's going to&#160;kill&#160;me!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=58></a>He started to run off, then&#160;scrambled back and&#160;gave&#160;me another hug. &#34;Be careful down there! Come&#160;<br/>
back alive!&#34; &#160;<br/>
Once he was gone, Nico and I roused Mrs. O'Leary&#160;from&#160;her nap.&#160;<br/>
When she smelled the tunnel, she got excited and led&#160;the way&#160;down the steps. It was a pretty&#160;tight fit.&#160;<br/>
I hoped she wouldn't get stuck. I couldn't imagine&#160;how&#160;much&#160;Drano we'd&#160;need to un-stick a hellhound&#160;<br/>wedged halfway&#160;down&#160;a tunnel to&#160;the&#160;Underworld.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ready?&#34; Nico asked me. &#34;It'll be fine. Don't worry.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He sounded like he was trying to convince himself.&#160;<br/>
I glanced up&#160;at the stars, wondering if I&#160;would ever&#160;see them&#160;again. Then we plunged into&#160;darkness.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The stairs went on&#160;forever—narrow, steep, and slippery. It was completely&#160;dark except for the light&#160;of my&#160;<br/>sword. I tried to go slow, but Mrs. O'Leary&#160;had other ideas. She bounded ahead, barking&#160;happily. The&#160;<br/>sound echoed&#160;through the tunnel like cannon shots, and&#160;I figured we&#160;would not&#160;be catching anybody&#160;by&#160;<br/>surprise once we reached the bottom.&#160;<br/>
Nico lagged behind, which I thought&#160;was strange.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You okay?&#34;&#160;I asked him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Fine.&#34; What&#160;was that expression on his&#160;face . . . doubt? &#34;Just keep&#160;moving,&#34; he said.&#160;<br/>
I didn't have much choice. I followed&#160;Mrs. O'Leary&#160;into the&#160;depths. After another hour, I started to&#160;<br/>
hear the roar of a river.&#160;<br/>
We emerged&#160;at the base of a cliff, on&#160;a plain of&#160;black volcanic sand. To&#160;our right, the River Styx&#160;<br/>
gushed from&#160;the rocks and roared off in a cascade&#160;of rapids. To our left, far&#160;away&#160;in the&#160;gloom, fires&#160;<br/>burned on&#160;the&#160;ramparts of&#160;Erebos, the great black walls of Hades's kingdom.&#160;<br/>
I shuddered. I'd first been here when I was twelve, and only&#160;Annabeth and Grover's&#160;company&#160;had&#160;<br/>
given me&#160;the courage to keep going. Nico wasn't&#160;going&#160;to&#160;be quite&#160;as helpful with the &#34;courage&#34; thing. He&#160;<br/>looked&#160;pale and worried himself.&#160;<br/>
Only&#160;Mrs. O'Leary&#160;acted happy.&#160;She ran along the beach, picked&#160;up a random&#160;human leg bone, and&#160;<br/>
romped back&#160;toward me. She dropped&#160;the bone at&#160;my&#160;feet and waited for me&#160;to throw it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;maybe later, girl.&#34; I&#160;stared at the dark waters, trying to&#160;get&#160;up&#160;my&#160;nerve. &#34;So, Nico . .&#160;.&#160;how do&#160;<br/>
we do<i>&#160;</i>this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to&#160;go inside the gates first,&#34; he said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;But the river's right here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I have to get&#160;something,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;It's the only&#160;way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He marched off&#160;without&#160;waiting.&#160;<br/>
I frowned. Nico hadn't mentioned anything about going&#160;inside the gates. But now that we were here, I&#160;<br/>
didn't know&#160;what else to do. Reluctantly, I followed&#160;him&#160;down the beach toward&#160;the big black gates.&#160;<br/>
Lines of the&#160;dead stood&#160;outside waiting to&#160;get in. It&#160;must've been a heavy&#160;day for funerals, because&#160;<br/>
even the EZ-DEATH line&#160;was backed up.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=59></a><i>&#34;Woof!&#34;&#160;&#160;</i>Mrs. O'Leary&#160;said. Before I could stop her&#160;she bounded toward the&#160;security&#160;checkpoint.&#160;<br/>
Cerberus, the guard&#160;dog&#160;of&#160;Hades, appeared out of&#160;the gloom—a three-headed rottweiler so big he made&#160;<br/>Mrs. O'Leary&#160;look like&#160;a toy&#160;poodle. Cerberus was&#160;half&#160;transparent, so&#160;he's&#160;really hard to&#160;see until he's&#160;<br/>close enough to kill&#160;you,&#160;but he acted like he didn't&#160;care&#160;about us. He was too&#160;busy&#160;saying&#160;hello to Mrs.&#160;<br/>O'Leary.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mrs. O'Leary, no!&#34;&#160;I shouted at her. &#34;Don't sniff . . .&#160;Oh, man.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico smiled. Then he looked at&#160;me and&#160;his expression turned all serious again, like he'd remembered&#160;<br/>
something unpleasant. &#34;Come on. They&#160;won't give us&#160;any&#160;trouble in the line. You're&#160;with&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't like&#160;it, but&#160;we slipped through the security&#160;ghouls and into&#160;the Fields&#160;of Asphodel. I had to&#160;<br/>
whistle for Mrs. O'Leary&#160;three times before&#160;she left Cerberus alone and ran after us.&#160;<br/>
We hiked over black fields&#160;of grass dotted with black poplar trees. If I really&#160;died in a few days&#160;like&#160;<br/>
the prophecy&#160;said, I might end up&#160;here forever, but I tried not to&#160;think about that.&#160;<br/>
Nico trudged&#160;ahead, bringing us closer and closer to the palace of Hades.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey,&#34; I said, &#34;we're inside&#160;the gates already.&#160;Where are we—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;growled. A shadow appeared overhead—something dark, cold,&#160;and stinking&#160;of&#160;death. It&#160;<br/>
swooped down and landed&#160;in the top of a&#160;poplar tree.&#160;<br/>
Unfortunately, I recognized her. She had a shriveled face, a horrible blue knit hat, and a crumpled&#160;<br/>
velvet dress.&#160;Leathery&#160;bat wings sprang from&#160;her back.&#160;Her feet had sharp talons, and in her brass-clawed&#160;<br/>hands she held a flaming whip and a&#160;paisley&#160;handbag.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mrs. Dodds,&#34;&#160;I said.&#160;<br/>
She bared her fangs. &#34;Welcome back, honey.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her two sisters—the other Furies—swooped down&#160;and&#160;settled next to her in the branches of the&#160;<br/>
poplar.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know Alecto?&#34; Nico&#160;asked&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;If&#160;you mean the hag in the middle, yeah,&#34; I said. &#34;She&#160;was&#160;my&#160;math teacher.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico nodded,&#160;like this didn't surprise him.&#160;He looked up at the Furies and took a deep breath. &#34;I've&#160;<br/>
done what my father asked. Take us to&#160;the palace.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I tensed. &#34;Wait a second, Nico. What do&#160;you—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;afraid this is&#160;my&#160;new&#160;lead, Percy.&#160;My father&#160;promised&#160;me&#160;information about my&#160;family, but he&#160;<br/>
wants to see&#160;you&#160;before we try&#160;the river. I'm&#160;sorry.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You&#160;<i>tricked&#160;</i>me?&#34; I&#160;was so&#160;mad I couldn't think. I lunged at him, but the Furies&#160;were fast.&#160;Two of&#160;<br/>
them&#160;swooped down&#160;and&#160;plucked me&#160;up by&#160;the arms.&#160;My&#160;sword fell&#160;out&#160;of my&#160;hand, and&#160;before I knew it,&#160;<br/>I was dangling sixty&#160;feet in the air.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, don't struggle, honey,&#34; my&#160;old math&#160;teacher&#160;cackled in my&#160;ear. &#34;I'd&#160;hate to drop&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;barked angrily and jumped, trying to reach me, but we were too high.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tell Mrs. O'Leary&#160;to behave,&#34; Nico warned. He&#160;was hovering near&#160;me in the&#160;clutches of the third&#160;<br/>
Fury. &#34;I&#160;don't want her to get hurt, Percy. My&#160;father is waiting. He just wants to talk.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=60></a>I wanted to tell Mrs.&#160;O'Leary&#160;to attack Nico, but&#160;it wouldn't have done any&#160;good, and Nico was&#160;right&#160;<br/>
about one thing: my&#160;dog could&#160;get hurt&#160;if she tried to&#160;pick a fight with the Furies.&#160;<br/>
I gritted my&#160;teeth. &#34;Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;down! It's&#160;okay,&#160;girl.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She whimpered and turned in circles,&#160;looking&#160;up&#160;at&#160;me. &#34;All right, traitor,&#34;&#160;I growled at Nico.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You've got&#160;your prize. Take me to the stupid&#160;palace.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Alecto dropped me like a sack of turnips&#160;in the middle of the palace garden.&#160;<br/>
It was beautiful in a creepy&#160;way.&#160;Skeletal white&#160;trees grew from&#160;marble&#160;basins. Flower beds&#160;<br/>
overflowed with golden&#160;plants and gemstones. A pair&#160;of thrones, one bone&#160;and one silver, sat on the&#160;<br/>balcony&#160;with a view of the&#160;Fields of Asphodel. It would've been&#160;a nice place to spend a Saturday&#160;morning&#160;<br/>except for the sulfurous smell and the cries of tortured&#160;souls in the distance.&#160;<br/>
Skeletal warriors guarded the only&#160;exit. They&#160;wore tattered U.S.&#160;Army&#160;desert&#160;combat fatigues and&#160;<br/>
carried M16s.&#160;<br/>
The third Fury&#160;deposited&#160;Nico next to&#160;me. Then all&#160;three of them settled on&#160;the top&#160;of the skeletal&#160;<br/>
throne. I resisted the urge to strangle Nico. They'd&#160;only stop me. I'd have to wait for my&#160;revenge.&#160;<br/>
I stared at the empty&#160;thrones, waiting for something&#160;to&#160;happen. Then the air shimmered. Three figures&#160;<br/>
appeared—Hades and Persephone on their thrones,&#160;and an older&#160;woman standing&#160;between them. They&#160;<br/>seemed to be in the middle of an argument.&#160;<br/>
&#34;—told&#160;you he&#160;was&#160;a bum!&#34; the older woman said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mother!&#34; Persephone replied.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have visitors!&#34; Hades&#160;barked. &#34;Please!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades, one of&#160;my&#160;least&#160;favorite gods, smoothed his&#160;black robes,&#160;which were&#160;covered with the terrified&#160;<br/>
faces of the damned. He had pale skin and the intense&#160;eyes of a madman.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34;&#160;he said with satisfaction. &#34;At last.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Queen Persephone studied me&#160;curiously. I'd seen her once before in the winter, but&#160;now in the&#160;<br/>
summer she looked like a totally&#160;different goddess. She had lustrous black hair and warm&#160;brown eyes.&#160;<br/>Her dress shimmered with&#160;colors. Flower patterns&#160;in the fabric changed and bloomed—roses, tulips,&#160;<br/>honeysuckle.&#160;<br/>
The woman standing&#160;between them&#160;was obviously&#160;Persephone's mother. She had the same hair and&#160;<br/>
eyes, but looked older and sterner. Her&#160;dress was golden, the color of a wheat field. Her hair was woven&#160;<br/>with dried grasses so&#160;it reminded&#160;me&#160;of a&#160;wicker basket. I figured if somebody&#160;lit a&#160;match&#160;next to her,&#160;<br/>she'd be in serious trouble.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hmmph,&#34; the older woman said. &#34;Demigods. Just what we need.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Next to&#160;me,&#160;Nico knelt. I&#160;wished I had&#160;my&#160;sword so I could cut his stupid head off. Unfortunately,&#160;<br/>
Riptide was still out in&#160;the&#160;fields somewhere.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Father,&#34; Nico said. &#34;I have&#160;done as you&#160;asked.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Took&#160;you&#160;long enough,&#34;&#160;Hades grumbled. &#34;Your&#160;sister would've done a better job.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=61></a>Nico lowered&#160;his head. If I&#160;hadn't been so mad at&#160;the little creep, I might've felt&#160;sorry&#160;for him.&#160;<br/>
I glared up at&#160;the god&#160;of the&#160;dead. &#34;What&#160;do&#160;you want,&#160;Hades?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;To talk, of&#160;course.&#34; The god twisted his&#160;mouth in a cruel smile. &#34;Didn't Nico tell you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So this whole quest was a&#160;lie. Nico brought me&#160;down here to get me killed.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, no,&#34; Hades said. &#34;I'm&#160;afraid Nico was quite sincere about wanting to&#160;help&#160;you.&#160;The&#160;boy is as&#160;<br/>
honest as he is dense. I simply&#160;convinced him&#160;to&#160;take a small detour and bring&#160;you here first.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Father,&#34; Nico said, &#34;you&#160;promised that Percy&#160;would&#160;not be harmed. You said if I brought him,&#160;you&#160;<br/>
would tell me&#160;about my&#160;past—about my&#160;mother.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Queen Persephone sighed&#160;dramatically. &#34;Can we&#160;<i>please&#160;</i>not talk about&#160;<i>that&#160;woman&#160;</i>in my&#160;presence?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;sorry, my&#160;dove,&#34; Hades said. &#34;I had to promise the boy&#160;something.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The older lady&#160;harrumphed. &#34;I warned&#160;you,&#160;daughter. This scoundrel Hades is no&#160;good. You&#160;could've&#160;<br/>
married the god of&#160;doctors&#160;or the god of&#160;lawyers, but&#160;<i>noooo.&#160;</i>You&#160;had to eat the pomegranate.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mother—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And get stuck in the Underworld!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mother, please—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And here it is August, and do&#160;you come&#160;home like you're&#160;supposed to? Do&#160;you ever think about&#160;your&#160;<br/>
poor lonely&#160;mother?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;DEMETER!&#34; Hades shouted. &#34;That is enough. You are a guest in my&#160;house.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, a house&#160;is it?&#34; she said. &#34;You call this dump&#160;a house? Make my&#160;daughter live in this&#160;dark,&#160;<br/>
damp—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I told&#160;you,&#34;&#160;Hades&#160;said, grinding&#160;his teeth, &#34;there's a&#160;<i>war&#160;</i>in the world above.&#160;You and Persephone&#160;<br/>
are better off here with&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Excuse&#160;me,&#34;&#160;I broke in. &#34;But if&#160;you're going&#160;to kill&#160;me, could&#160;you just get on&#160;with it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
All three gods looked at me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, this one has an attitude,&#34; Demeter observed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Indeed,&#34; Hades agreed. &#34;I'd&#160;love to kill&#160;him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Father!&#34; Nico said. &#34;You&#160;promised!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Husband, we&#160;talked about this,&#34; Persephone chided. &#34;You can't&#160;go around&#160;incinerating every&#160;hero.&#160;<br/>
Besides, he's&#160;brave. I like that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades rolled&#160;his eyes. &#34;You liked that Orpheus fellow&#160;too. Look how well that turned out. Let me kill&#160;<br/>
him,&#160;just a little bit.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Father, you promised!&#34; Nico said. &#34;You&#160;said you&#160;only&#160;wanted to&#160;talk to him.&#160;You said if I&#160;brought&#160;<br/>
him,&#160;you'd explain.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades glowered, smoothing the folds of his robes. &#34;And so I shall.&#160;Your&#160;mother—what can I&#160;tell you?&#160;<br/>
She was a&#160;wonderful woman.&#34; He glanced uncomfortably&#160;at Persephone. &#34;Forgive&#160;me,&#160;my&#160;dear. I&#160;mean&#160;<br/>for a mortal,&#160;of course.&#160;Her name was Maria di Angelo. She&#160;was from&#160;Venice, but her father was a&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=62></a>diplomat in&#160;Washington,&#160;D.C. That's where I&#160;met her. When&#160;you&#160;and&#160;your sister were young,&#160;it was&#160;a bad&#160;<br/>time to be children of Hades. World War II was brewing. A few&#160;of my, ah,&#160;<i>other&#160;</i>children were leading&#160;<br/>the losing side. I thought it&#160;best to put&#160;you two out of&#160;harm's&#160;way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's why&#160;you hid us in&#160;the Lotus Casino?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades shrugged. &#34;You didn't&#160;age. You didn't realize&#160;time was passing. I waited for the right&#160;time to&#160;<br/>
bring you out.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But what happened to&#160;our&#160;mother? Why don't I remember her?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not important,&#34; Hades snapped.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;What?&#160;</i>Of course it's important. And&#160;you had&#160;other&#160;children—why were we the only&#160;ones who were&#160;<br/>
sent away? And who was the lawyer who got&#160;us out?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades grit his teeth. &#34;You&#160;would do well to listen more&#160;and talk less, boy.&#160;As for the lawyer . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades snapped his fingers. On top of&#160;his throne, the Fury Alecto began to change until she was&#160;a&#160;<br/>
middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit&#160;with a briefcase. She—he—looked strange crouching at Hades's&#160;<br/>shoulder.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You!&#34; Nico&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
The Fury&#160;cackled. &#34;I do lawyers and teachers very&#160;well!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico was trembling. &#34;But why&#160;did&#160;you&#160;free us from&#160;the casino?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know why,&#34; Hades said. &#34;This idiot son&#160;of Poseidon cannot be allowed to be the child of the&#160;<br/>
prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I plucked&#160;a ruby&#160;off the nearest plant and threw it at Hades. It sank harmlessly into&#160;his&#160;robe. &#34;You&#160;<br/>
should be helping Olympus!&#34; I said. &#34;All the other gods are fighting Typhon, and you're just sitting&#160;<br/>here—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Waiting things out,&#34; Hades finished. &#34;Yes, that's&#160;correct. When's&#160;the last time&#160;Olympus ever&#160;helped&#160;<br/>
me, half-blood? When's&#160;the last time&#160;a&#160;child of&#160;<i>mine&#160;</i>was&#160;ever welcomed as a&#160;hero? Bah! Why&#160;should I&#160;<br/>rush out and&#160;help them?&#160;I'll&#160;stay&#160;here with my&#160;forces intact.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And when Kronos comes after you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Let him try.&#160;He'll be weakened. And my&#160;son here,&#160;Nico—&#34; Hades looked at him with distaste. &#34;Well,&#160;<br/>
he's&#160;not&#160;much now, I'll grant you. It would've been&#160;better if Bianca had lived. But give him four&#160;more&#160;<br/>years of training. We can hold out that&#160;long, surely.&#160;Nico will turn sixteen, as the prophecy&#160;says, and then&#160;<br/>
<i>he&#160;</i>will make&#160;the decision that will save the world. And I will be king of the gods.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're crazy,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>I said. &#34;Kronos will crush&#160;you, right after he finishes pulverizing&#160;Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades&#160;spread&#160;his hands. &#34;Well, you'll get a chance&#160;to find out, half-blood. Because you'll be waiting&#160;<br/>
out this war in&#160;my&#160;dungeons.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; Nico said. &#34;Father, that wasn't&#160;our agreement. And&#160;you&#160;haven't told me everything!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I've told you&#160;all you need to know,&#34; Hades said. &#34;As for our agreement, I&#160;spoke with Jackson. I did&#160;<br/>
not harm&#160;him. You got&#160;your information. If you had&#160;wanted a better deal, you should've made&#160;me&#160;swear&#160;<br/>on the Styx.&#160;Now, go to&#160;your room!&#34; He waved his hand, and Nico&#160;vanished.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=63></a>&#34;That boy needs to eat&#160;more,&#34; Demeter&#160;grumbled. &#34;He's too skinny. He needs&#160;more cereal.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Persephone rolled her eyes. &#34;Mother, enough&#160;with the&#160;cereal. My&#160;lord Hades, are&#160;you sure we can't&#160;let&#160;<br/>
this little hero go? He's&#160;awfully&#160;brave.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, my&#160;dear. I've spared his life. That's&#160;enough.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was&#160;sure she was going to&#160;stand up for&#160;me. The brave, beautiful Persephone was going to&#160;get&#160;me&#160;<br/>
out of this.&#160;<br/>
She shrugged&#160;indifferently.&#160;&#34;Fine. What's&#160;for breakfast? I'm&#160;starving.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Cereal,&#34; Demeter said.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Mother!&#34;&#160;</i>The two women&#160;disappeared in a swirl of flowers and wheat.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't feel too bad, Percy Jackson,&#34;&#160;Hades said.&#160;&#34;My ghosts keep&#160;me&#160;well&#160;informed of Kronos's&#160;<br/>
plans. I can assure you that&#160;you had no&#160;chance to stop him&#160;in time. By&#160;tonight,&#160;it will be too late for your&#160;<br/>precious Mount Olympus. The trap will be sprung.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What&#160;trap?&#34; I&#160;demanded.&#160;&#34;If you know about&#160;it, do&#160;something! At least let&#160;me tell the other gods!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades smiled. &#34;You are spirited. I'll give&#160;you credit&#160;for that. Have fun in&#160;my&#160;dungeon. We'll check on&#160;<br/>
you again in—oh, fifty&#160;or&#160;sixty&#160;years.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
EIGHT&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;TAKE &#160;THE &#160;WORST&#160;<br/>
BATH &#160;EVER&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
My&#160;sword reappeared in my pocket.&#160;<br/>
Yeah, great timing. Now I&#160;could attack the walls all I wanted. My&#160;cell had no bars, no windows, not&#160;<br/>
even a door.&#160;The skeletal&#160;guards shoved me straight&#160;through a wall, and it became solid behind me. I&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;sure if&#160;the room&#160;was airtight. Probably. Hades's&#160;dungeon&#160;was&#160;meant for dead people, and&#160;they&#160;don't&#160;<br/>breathe. So forget fifty&#160;or&#160;sixty&#160;years.&#160;I'd be dead in fifty&#160;or sixty minutes. Meanwhile, if Hades wasn't&#160;<br/>lying,&#160;some&#160;big trap was going&#160;to&#160;be sprung in&#160;New&#160;York by&#160;the end of&#160;the&#160;day,&#160;and there was absolutely&#160;<br/>nothing I could do about it.&#160;<br/>
I sat on the cold stone floor, feeling miserable.&#160;<br/>
I don't remember dozing off. Then again, it&#160;must've been about seven in the&#160;morning, mortal time, and&#160;<br/>
I'd been through a lot.&#160;<br/>
I dreamed I&#160;was on the porch of Rachel's beach&#160;house in St. Thomas. The&#160;sun was rising&#160;over the&#160;<br/>
Caribbean. Dozens of wooded islands dotted the sea,&#160;and white sails cut across the water. The smell of&#160;<br/>salt air&#160;made me wonder if I would ever&#160;see the ocean&#160;again.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=64></a>Rachel's&#160;parents sat&#160;at the&#160;patio table while a personal chef&#160;fixed&#160;them&#160;omelets.&#160;Mr. Dare&#160;was dressed&#160;<br/>
in a white linen suit. He was reading&#160;<i>The Wall Street Journal.&#160;</i>The lady&#160;across the table was probably&#160;<br/>Mrs. Dare, though all I could see of&#160;her were&#160;hot pink fingernails&#160;and the cover&#160;of&#160;<i>Condé Nast Traveler.&#160;<br/></i>Why&#160;she'd be reading about vacations while she was&#160;on vacation, I wasn't sure.&#160;<br/>
Rachel stood at the porch railing and sighed. She wore Bermuda shorts and her van Gogh&#160;T-shirt.&#160;<br/>
(Yeah, Rachel was trying to&#160;teach&#160;me about art, but&#160;don't get too impressed. I only&#160;remembered the dude's&#160;<br/>name&#160;because he cut his ear off.)&#160;<br/>
I wondered if&#160;she was thinking&#160;about&#160;me, and how&#160;much it sucked that I&#160;wasn't&#160;with them&#160;on&#160;<br/>
vacation. I know that's&#160;what&#160;<i>I&#160;</i>was thinking.&#160;<br/>
Then the scene changed. I was in St. Louis, standing&#160;downtown under the Arch. I'd been there before.&#160;<br/>
In fact, I'd almost fallen to my&#160;death there before.&#160;<br/>
Over the city, a thunderstorm&#160;boiled—a&#160;wall of absolute black with lightning streaking across the sky.&#160;<br/>
A few blocks away, swarms of emergency vehicles gathered with their lights flashing. A column&#160;of dust&#160;<br/>rose from&#160;a&#160;mound&#160;of rubble, which I realized was a&#160;collapsed skyscraper.&#160;<br/>
A nearby&#160;reporter was yelling into her&#160;microphone: &#34;Officials&#160;are describing this as a&#160;structural&#160;<br/>
failure, Dan, though no one&#160;seems to know if&#160;it is related to the storm&#160;conditions.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Wind whipped her hair. The temperature was dropping&#160;rapidly, like ten degrees just since&#160;I'd been&#160;<br/>
standing there.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thankfully,&#160;the building&#160;had been abandoned for&#160;demolition,&#34; she said. &#34;But police have evacuated&#160;<br/>
all nearby&#160;buildings for fear&#160;the collapse might trigger—&#34;&#160;<br/>
She faltered as&#160;a&#160;mighty groan cut through the sky. A&#160;blast of lightning&#160;hit the center of the darkness.&#160;<br/>
The entire&#160;city&#160;shook. The&#160;air glowed,&#160;and every&#160;hair on&#160;my&#160;body stood up. The blast&#160;was so powerful I&#160;<br/>knew it could&#160;only&#160;be one thing: Zeus's&#160;master bolt. It&#160;should&#160;have vaporized its target, but the dark cloud&#160;<br/>only&#160;staggered backward. A smoky&#160;fist&#160;appeared out&#160;of the clouds. It smashed another tower, and the&#160;<br/>whole thing collapsed like children's blocks.&#160;<br/>
The reporter screamed. People ran through the streets. Emergency lights flashed. I saw a streak of&#160;<br/>
silver in the&#160;sky—a chariot pulled by&#160;reindeer, but it&#160;wasn't Santa Claus&#160;driving. It was&#160;Artemis, riding&#160;<br/>the storm,&#160;shooting shafts of moonlight into the darkness. A fiery golden comet crossed her path . . .&#160;<br/>maybe her brother Apollo.&#160;<br/>
One thing was clear: Typhon had made&#160;it to the Mississippi River. He was halfway&#160;across the U.S.,&#160;<br/>
leaving destruction in&#160;his&#160;wake, and the gods were barely&#160;slowing&#160;him&#160;down.&#160;<br/>
The mountain of&#160;darkness loomed above&#160;me. A foot&#160;the size of Yankee Stadium&#160;was about to smash&#160;<br/>
me when a voice hissed,&#160;<i>&#34;Percy!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
I lunged&#160;out&#160;blindly. Before I was fully awake, I had&#160;Nico pinned&#160;to the floor&#160;of&#160;the cell with the edge&#160;<br/>
of my&#160;sword at his throat.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Want . . . to&#160;. . . rescue,&#34; he choked.&#160;<br/>
Anger woke me up fast. &#34;Oh,&#160;yeah? And why&#160;should&#160;I trust&#160;you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=65></a>&#34;No . . . choice?&#34; he gagged.&#160;<br/>
I wished he hadn't said something logical like that. I let him&#160;go.&#160;<br/>
Nico curled into a ball and&#160;made retching sounds while&#160;his throat recovered. Finally he got to&#160;his feet,&#160;<br/>
eyeing my&#160;sword warily.&#160;His own blade was sheathed.&#160;I suppose if he'd&#160;wanted to&#160;kill me,&#160;he could've&#160;<br/>done it while&#160;I slept. Still, I&#160;didn't trust him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to&#160;get out of&#160;here,&#34; he said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why?&#34; I said. &#34;Does&#160;your&#160;dad want to&#160;<i>talk&#160;</i>to me&#160;again?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He winced. &#34;Percy, I swear on the River&#160;Styx, I&#160;didn't&#160;know what he&#160;was planning.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know what&#160;your&#160;dad is&#160;like!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He tricked&#160;me. He promised—&#34; Nico&#160;held up his hands. &#34;Look .&#160;. . right now,&#160;we need to leave. I put&#160;<br/>
the guards to&#160;sleep, but it&#160;won't last.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to&#160;strangle him&#160;again. Unfortunately, he&#160;was right. We didn't have time to argue, and I&#160;<br/>
couldn't escape on my&#160;own. He pointed at the wall. A whole section vanished,&#160;revealing a corridor.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come on.&#34;&#160;Nico led the way.&#160;<br/>
I wished I had Annabeth's&#160;invisibility hat, but as it turned out, I didn't&#160;need it. Every&#160;time we&#160;came to&#160;<br/>
a skeleton guard, Nico just pointed at it,&#160;and its glowing eyes dimmed. Unfortunately, the&#160;more Nico did&#160;<br/>it, the&#160;more tired he seemed. We walked through a maze of corridors filled with guards. By the time&#160;we&#160;<br/>reached a kitchen staffed&#160;by&#160;skeletal cooks and servants, I was&#160;practically&#160;carrying Nico.&#160;He&#160;managed&#160;to&#160;<br/>put all the dead to sleep but nearly passed out himself.&#160;I dragged him&#160;out of the servants' entrance and into&#160;<br/>the Fields of&#160;Asphodel.&#160;<br/>
I almost felt relieved until I&#160;heard the sound of&#160;bronze&#160;gongs&#160;high in&#160;the castle.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Alarms,&#34; Nico murmured&#160;sleepily.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What do we&#160;do?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He yawned then frowned like he was trying to remember. &#34;How about . . .&#160;run?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Running&#160;with&#160;a drowsy child of Hades was&#160;more like doing&#160;a three-legged race with a life-size rag doll. I&#160;<br/>lugged&#160;him&#160;along,&#160;holding&#160;my&#160;sword in front of me. The spirits of the dead made way&#160;like the Celestial&#160;<br/>bronze was a&#160;blazing fire.&#160;<br/>
The sound&#160;of&#160;gongs rolled&#160;across the fields. Ahead loomed the walls of Erebos, but the longer we&#160;<br/>
walked, the farther away&#160;they&#160;seemed.&#160;I was&#160;about to&#160;collapse from&#160;exhaustion when I heard a familiar&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;WOOOOOF!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;bounded out&#160;of nowhere and ran circles around&#160;us, ready&#160;to play.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good girl.'&#34; I said. &#34;Can&#160;you give us a ride to the Styx?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The word&#160;<i>Styx&#160;</i>got her excited. She probably&#160;thought&#160;I&#160;meant&#160;<i>sticks.&#160;</i>She jumped&#160;a few times,&#160;chased&#160;<br/>
her tail just&#160;to teach it&#160;who was boss, and then calmed down enough for me to&#160;push Nico onto her back.&#160;I&#160;<br/>climb aboard, and she raced toward the gates. She&#160;leaped straight over the EZ-DEATH&#160;line, sending&#160;<br/>guards sprawling and&#160;causing more alarms to blare.&#160;Cerberus barked, but&#160;he&#160;sounded&#160;more excited than&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=66></a>angry,&#160;like:&#160;<i>Can I play too?</i>&#160;<br/>
Fortunately,&#160;he didn't follow us, and Mrs. O'Leary kept running. She didn't stop until we were far&#160;<br/>
upriver and the fires of Erebos had disappeared in the&#160;murk.&#160;<br/>
Nico slid off Mrs. O'Leary's back and crumpled in a heap on the black sand.&#160;<br/>
I took out a square of ambrosia—part of&#160;the emergency&#160;god-food I&#160;always&#160;kept with&#160;me. It&#160;was a little&#160;<br/>
bashed up, but Nico chewed&#160;it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Uh,&#34; he mumbled. &#34;Better.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your powers drain&#160;you&#160;too much,&#34; I noted.&#160;<br/>
He nodded sleepily.&#160;&#34;With&#160;great power . . . comes great need to take&#160;a nap. Wake&#160;me&#160;up later.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Whoa, zombie dude.&#34; I caught him&#160;before he could pass out again. &#34;We're at the river. You need to&#160;<br/>
tell&#160;me&#160;what to&#160;do.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I fed him&#160;the last of&#160;my&#160;ambrosia, which was&#160;a&#160;little dangerous. The stuff can heal demigods, but it&#160;<br/>
can also burn us to ashes if we eat&#160;too&#160;much. Fortunately, it seemed to do the trick. Nico shook his head&#160;a&#160;<br/>few times and struggled to his feet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My father will be coming soon,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;We should hurry.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The River Styx's current swirled with strange&#160;objects—broken toys, ripped-up college diplomas,&#160;<br/>
wilted homecoming corsages—all&#160;the dreams people had thrown away&#160;as they'd&#160;passed from life into&#160;<br/>death. Looking at the black water, I could think of about three million places I'd&#160;rather swim.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So . .&#160;. I just&#160;jump&#160;in?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You have to prepare yourself first,&#34;&#160;Nico said, &#34;or the river will&#160;destroy&#160;you.&#160;It will burn away&#160;your&#160;<br/>
body and soul.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sounds fun,&#34; I muttered.&#160;<br/>
&#34;This is no joke,&#34; Nico warned. &#34;There is only&#160;one&#160;way&#160;to stay&#160;anchored to&#160;your mortal life. You&#160;<br/>
have to . .&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He glanced behind me&#160;and his eyes widened. I turned and found myself face-to-face with a Greek&#160;<br/>
warrior.&#160;<br/>
For a second I thought he&#160;was Ares, because this&#160;guy&#160;looked exactly&#160;like the&#160;god of war—tall and&#160;<br/>
buff, with a cruel scarred face&#160;and closely&#160;shaved black hair. He&#160;wore a&#160;white tunic and bronze armor.&#160;He&#160;<br/>held a plumed war helm&#160;under his arm.&#160;But his&#160;eyes were human—pale green like a shallow sea—and a&#160;<br/>bloody arrow stuck out&#160;of&#160;his left calf, just above the&#160;ankle.&#160;<br/>
I stunk at Greek names,&#160;but even I knew the greatest warrior of all time, who had died&#160;from&#160;a&#160;<br/>
wounded heel.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Achilles,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=67></a>The ghost nodded. &#34;I warned the other one not&#160;to follow my&#160;path.&#160;Now I will warn you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke? You spoke with Luke?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Do not do this,&#34; he said. &#34;It will&#160;make&#160;you powerful. But it will also make you weak. Your prowess&#160;<br/>
in combat will&#160;be beyond any&#160;mortal's, but&#160;your weaknesses, your failings will increase as&#160;well.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You&#160;mean I'll have a bad heel?&#34; I said. &#34;Couldn't&#160;I&#160;just, like, wear something besides&#160;sandals?&#160;No&#160;<br/>
offense.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He stared down at his bloody&#160;foot. &#34;The heel is only&#160;my&#160;<i>physical&#160;</i>weakness, demigod. My&#160;mother,&#160;<br/>
Thetis, held&#160;me there when she dipped&#160;me in the Styx. What really killed me&#160;was&#160;my&#160;own arrogance.&#160;<br/>Beware! Turn back!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He&#160;meant it.&#160;I could hear&#160;the regret and bitterness in&#160;his voice. He was honestly&#160;trying to save&#160;me&#160;<br/>
from&#160;a terrible fate.&#160;<br/>
Then again, Luke had been&#160;here, and he hadn't turned&#160;back.&#160;<br/>
<i>That's&#160;</i>why&#160;Luke had been&#160;able to host&#160;the spirit of&#160;Kronos without his body&#160;disintegrating.&#160;This is&#160;<br/>
how he'd&#160;prepared himself, and why&#160;he seemed impossible to kill. He had bathed in the River Styx and&#160;<br/>taken on the&#160;powers of the greatest&#160;mortal hero, Achilles. He was invincible.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I have to,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Otherwise I don't stand a chance.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Achilles lowered his head. &#34;Let the gods witness I&#160;tried. Hero, if&#160;you must do this, concentrate on&#160;<br/>
your mortal&#160;point. Imagine one spot of your body that&#160;will remain vulnerable. This is the&#160;point where&#160;<br/>your soul will&#160;anchor&#160;your&#160;body&#160;to&#160;the&#160;world. It will be your greatest weakness, but also&#160;your only&#160;hope.&#160;<br/>No man&#160;may&#160;be completely invulnerable. Lose sight&#160;of what keeps you mortal, and the River Styx&#160;will&#160;<br/>burn&#160;you to&#160;ashes. You will cease to exist.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't suppose you could&#160;tell me Luke's&#160;mortal point?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He scowled. &#34;Prepare yourself, foolish&#160;boy.&#160;Whether&#160;you survive&#160;this or not,&#160;you have sealed&#160;your&#160;<br/>
doom!&#34;&#160;<br/>
With that happy&#160;thought, he&#160;vanished.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Nico said, &#34;maybe&#160;he's right.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;This was&#160;<i>your&#160;</i>idea.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know,&#160;but&#160;now that we're here—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just wait on&#160;the shore. If anything happens to&#160;me&#160;. . . Well,&#160;maybe Hades&#160;will get his&#160;wish, and&#160;<br/>
you'll be the&#160;child of the&#160;prophecy&#160;after all.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He didn't look pleased about that, but I&#160;didn't care.&#160;<br/>
Before I could change my&#160;mind, I concentrated on&#160;the small of my&#160;back—a tiny&#160;point just opposite&#160;<br/>
my&#160;navel. It was&#160;well defended when I wore&#160;my&#160;armor. It&#160;would be hard to hit by&#160;accident, and few&#160;<br/>enemies would aim&#160;for it&#160;on purpose.&#160;No place was&#160;perfect, but this seemed right to me, and a lot more&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=68></a>dignified than, like, my&#160;armpit or something.&#160;<br/>
I pictured a&#160;string, a bungee cord connecting&#160;me&#160;to the world&#160;from the&#160;small of&#160;my&#160;back. And I&#160;<br/>
stepped into the river.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Imagine jumping into a pit of&#160;boiling acid. Now multiply&#160;that pain&#160;times fifty.&#160;You still won't be close to&#160;<br/>understanding what it felt like to swim&#160;in the Styx. I&#160;planned to walk in slow and courageous&#160;like a real&#160;<br/>hero. As soon&#160;as the water touched my legs, my&#160;muscles turned to jelly&#160;and I fell face-first into the&#160;<br/>current.&#160;<br/>
I submerged completely.&#160;For the first time in&#160;my&#160;life, I couldn't breathe underwater. I finally&#160;<br/>
understood the panic of drowning. Every&#160;nerve in my&#160;body&#160;burned. I was dissolving in&#160;the water. I saw&#160;<br/>faces—Rachel, Grover, Tyson, my&#160;mother—but they&#160;faded as soon as they&#160;appeared.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; my&#160;mom said. &#34;I give&#160;you my&#160;blessing.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Be safe, brother!&#34; Tyson pleaded.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Enchiladas!&#34; Grover said. I wasn't sure&#160;where that came from,&#160;but it didn't seem to help much.&#160;<br/>
I was losing the fight. The pain was too much. My&#160;hands and feet were&#160;melting into&#160;the water,&#160;my&#160;<br/>
soul was being ripped from&#160;my&#160;body.&#160;I couldn't remember who&#160;I was. The pain of Kronos's scythe had&#160;<br/>been nothing&#160;compared to this.&#160;<br/>
<i>The cord,&#160;</i>a familiar voice said.&#160;<i>Remember your lifeline, dummy!</i>&#160;<br/>
Suddenly there was&#160;a tug in my&#160;lower back. The current pulled at&#160;me, but it wasn't&#160;carrying&#160;me away&#160;<br/>
anymore. I imagined the string in my&#160;back keeping&#160;me tied to the shore.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hold on, Seaweed&#160;Brain.&#34; It was Annabeth's&#160;voice,&#160;much clearer now. &#34;You're not getting away&#160;<br/>
from&#160;me&#160;that easily.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The cord strengthened.&#160;<br/>
I could see Annabeth now—standing barefoot above&#160;me&#160;on the canoe lake pier. I'd fallen out of&#160;my&#160;<br/>
canoe. That&#160;was it. She&#160;was&#160;reaching out her hand to&#160;haul&#160;me&#160;up, and she was trying not&#160;to laugh. She&#160;<br/>wore her orange camp&#160;T-shirt and jeans. Her hair&#160;was tucked up in her Yankees&#160;cap, which&#160;was strange&#160;<br/>because that should have made her invisible.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You are such an idiot sometimes.&#34; She smiled. &#34;Come on. Take my&#160;hand.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Memories&#160;came flooding&#160;back to me—sharper and more colorful. I stopped dissolving. My&#160;name&#160;was&#160;<br/>
Percy&#160;Jackson. I reached up&#160;and took Annabeth's hand.&#160;<br/>
Suddenly I burst out of&#160;the&#160;river. I collapsed on&#160;the sand, and Nico&#160;scrambled back in surprise.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you okay?&#34;&#160;he stammered. &#34;Your skin. Oh,&#160;gods. You're hurt!&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;arms&#160;were&#160;bright red. I felt like every inch&#160;of&#160;my&#160;body had been&#160;broiled&#160;over a slow flame.&#160;<br/>
I looked around for Annabeth, though I&#160;knew she wasn't&#160;here. It had seemed so real.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm fine . . .&#160;I think.&#34; The&#160;color of my&#160;skin turned back to normal.&#160;The pain subsided. Mrs. O'Leary&#160;<br/>
came up and&#160;sniffed me with concern. Apparently&#160;I smelled really&#160;interesting.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=69></a>&#34;Do&#160;you feel&#160;stronger?&#34; Nico asked.&#160;<br/>
Before I could decide&#160;<i>what&#160;</i>I felt, a voice boomed, &#34;THERE!&#34;&#160;<br/>
An army&#160;of the dead&#160;marched toward us. A hundred&#160;skeletal Roman legionnaires led the&#160;way&#160;with&#160;<br/>
shields and spears. Behind them&#160;came an equal&#160;number&#160;of British redcoats with&#160;bayonets&#160;fixed. In the&#160;<br/>middle of the host, Hades&#160;himself rode&#160;a black-and-gold chariot pulled by&#160;nightmare&#160;horses,&#160;their eyes&#160;<br/>and manes smoldering with fire.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You will not escape&#160;me this time, Percy&#160;Jackson!&#34; Hades bellowed. &#34;Destroy&#160;him!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Father, no!&#34; Nico shouted, but it was too late. The front line of Roman zombies lowered their spears&#160;<br/>
and advanced.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary growled and got ready&#160;to&#160;pounce. Maybe&#160;that's&#160;what set&#160;me off. I didn't want them&#160;<br/>
hurting my&#160;dog. Plus, I was tired of Hades being a big bully. If&#160;I was going to die, I might as well go&#160;<br/>down fighting.&#160;<br/>
I&#160;yelled, and&#160;the River Styx exploded.&#160;A black tidal&#160;wave smashed into&#160;the legionnaires. &#160;Spears and&#160;<br/>
shields flew everywhere. Roman zombies began to&#160;dissolve, smoke coming&#160;off their bronze helmets.&#160;<br/>
The redcoats lowered their bayonets, but&#160;I didn't wait for them. I charged.&#160;<br/>
It was the&#160;stupidest thing&#160;I've&#160;ever done. A hundred&#160;muskets fired at&#160;me, point blank. All of them&#160;<br/>
missed. I crashed into their line and started hacking with Riptide. Bayonets jabbed. Swords slashed. Guns&#160;<br/>reloaded and&#160;fired. Nothing touched me.&#160;<br/>
I whirled through the ranks, slashing redcoats to dust,&#160;one after the other. My&#160;mind went on&#160;autopilot:&#160;<br/>
stab, dodge, cut, deflect, roll. Riptide was no longer a sword. It was an arc of pure destruction.&#160;<br/>
I broke through the enemy line and leaped into the black&#160;chariot.&#160;Hades raised&#160;his staff. A&#160;bolt of dark&#160;<br/>
energy&#160;shot toward&#160;me, but I deflected it off&#160;my&#160;blade and slammed into him.&#160;The god and I&#160;both tumbled&#160;<br/>out of the chariot.&#160;<br/>
The next thing I&#160;knew, my&#160;knee was planted on&#160;Hades's chest. I was holding&#160;the collar of&#160;his royal&#160;<br/>
robes in one fist, and the tip of my&#160;sword was poised right over his&#160;face.&#160;<br/>
Silence. The&#160;army&#160;did nothing to defend&#160;their&#160;master. I glanced&#160;back and realized why.&#160;There&#160;was&#160;<br/>
nothing&#160;left of&#160;them&#160;but weapons in the sand and piles of smoking, empty&#160;uniforms. I had destroyed them&#160;<br/>all.&#160;<br/>
Hades swallowed. &#34;Now, Jackson, listen here. . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
He was immortal. There was no way&#160;I could kill&#160;him,&#160;but gods can be wounded.&#160;I knew that firsthand,&#160;<br/>
and I figured a sword in the&#160;face&#160;wouldn't feel too good.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just because I'm&#160;a nice person,&#34; I snarled, &#34;I'll let you go. But first,&#160;tell me about that trap!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades&#160;melted&#160;into nothing, leaving me&#160;holding&#160;empty&#160;black robes.&#160;<br/>
I cursed and got to my&#160;feet, breathing&#160;heavily. Now that the danger was over, I realized how tired I&#160;<br/>
was. Every&#160;muscle in my&#160;body&#160;ached.&#160;I looked&#160;down&#160;at&#160;my&#160;clothes. They&#160;were slashed to pieces and full&#160;<br/>of bullet holes, but I was fine. Not a mark on me.&#160;<br/>
Nico's&#160;mouth hung&#160;open.&#160;&#34;You just . .&#160;.&#160;with a sword . . .&#160;you just—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=70></a>&#34;I think the river thing worked,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh gee,&#34; he&#160;said sarcastically.&#160;<i>&#34;You&#160;think?&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary barked happily&#160;and wagged her tail. She bounded around, sniffing empty&#160;uniforms and&#160;<br/>
hunting for&#160;bones. I lifted&#160;Hades's robe. I could still see the tormented faces shimmering in the fabric.&#160;<br/>
I walked to the edge of the&#160;river. &#34;Be free.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I dropped&#160;the&#160;robe in the water and watched&#160;as it swirled away, dissolving&#160;in the current.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Go back to your father,&#34;&#160;I told Nico. &#34;Tell him he owes&#160;me for letting him&#160;go. Find out what's&#160;going&#160;<br/>
to happen to&#160;Mount Olympus and convince him&#160;to help.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico stared at me. &#34;I . . . I can't. He'll hate&#160;me&#160;now. I mean . . . even more.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You have to,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;You&#160;owe&#160;me&#160;too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
His ears turned red. &#34;Percy, I told&#160;you I&#160;was sorry. Please . . . let&#160;me come&#160;with&#160;you. I want to&#160;fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You'll be&#160;more help down here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You mean you don't trust me anymore,&#34; he said miserably.&#160;<br/>
I didn't answer. I didn't&#160;know what I meant. I was&#160;too stunned by&#160;what I'd just done in battle&#160;to think&#160;<br/>
clearly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just go back to your father,&#34; I said, trying not to&#160;sound too harsh. &#34;Work on&#160;him.&#160;You're&#160;the only&#160;<br/>
person who&#160;might be able to get him&#160;to listen.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's&#160;a depressing thought.&#34; Nico&#160;sighed. &#34;All right. I'll do&#160;my&#160;best. Besides, he's still hiding&#160;<br/>
something from&#160;me&#160;about&#160;my&#160;mom.&#160;Maybe I can find&#160;out what.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good luck.&#160;Now Mrs. O'Leary&#160;and I&#160;have to go.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Where?&#34;&#160;Nico said.&#160;<br/>
I looked at the cave entrance and thought about the long&#160;climb back to the world of&#160;the living. &#34;To get&#160;<br/>
this war started. It's&#160;time I found Luke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
NINE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
TWO &#160;SNAKES &#160;SAVE&#160;<br/>
MY &#160;LIFE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>I love New&#160;York. You can pop out of&#160;the Underworld&#160;in Central Park, hail a taxi, head down Fifth&#160;<br/>Avenue with a giant hellhound&#160;loping&#160;along behind you, and&#160;nobody&#160;even looks&#160;at you funny.&#160;<br/>
Of course, the Mist helped. People probably&#160;couldn't&#160;see Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;or maybe they&#160;thought she&#160;<br/>
was a large, loud,&#160;very&#160;friendly&#160;truck.&#160;<br/>
I took the risk&#160;of&#160;using my&#160;mom's cell&#160;phone to&#160;call&#160;Annabeth for&#160;the second time. I'd called&#160;her once&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=71></a>from the runnel but only&#160;reached her voice&#160;mail. I'd gotten surprisingly&#160;good reception, seeing as I&#160;was at&#160;<br/>the mythological center of the world and all, but I&#160;didn't want to&#160;see what&#160;my&#160;mom's roaming charges&#160;<br/>were going to&#160;be.&#160;<br/>
This time, Annabeth picked&#160;up.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey,&#34; I said. &#34;You get my&#160;message?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, where have you been? Your message said&#160;almost nothing!&#160;We've been worried sick!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll fill you in&#160;later,&#34; I said, though how I was&#160;going to do that I&#160;had no idea. &#34;Where are you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We're&#160;on our way&#160;like&#160;you asked, almost to the Queens—Midtown Tunnel. But,&#160;Percy,&#160;what&#160;are you&#160;<br/>
planning? We've left the camp virtually&#160;undefended,&#160;and there's no way&#160;the gods—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Trust me,&#34; I said. &#34;I'll see you there.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I hung up. My&#160;hands were trembling. I&#160;wasn't&#160;sure if&#160;it was a leftover reaction from&#160;my&#160;dip in the&#160;<br/>
Styx, or anticipation of what I was about to do. If this&#160;didn't work, being invulnerable wasn't&#160;going to save&#160;<br/>me from&#160;getting blasted to&#160;bits.&#160;<br/>
It was late&#160;afternoon when&#160;the taxi dropped&#160;me&#160;at&#160;the Empire State Building. Mrs. O'Leary&#160;bounded&#160;<br/>
up and&#160;down Fifth Avenue, licking cabs and sniffing hot dog&#160;carts. Nobody&#160;seemed to notice her,&#160;<br/>although&#160;people did swerve away&#160;and look confused&#160;when she came close.&#160;<br/>
I whistled for her to heel&#160;as three white vans pulled up to the curb. They&#160;said&#160;<i>Delphi Strawberry&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Service,&#160;</i>which was the cover name&#160;for Camp&#160;Half-Blood. I'd never seen all three vans in the&#160;same place&#160;<br/>at once, though I knew they shuttled&#160;our&#160;fresh produce into the city.&#160;<br/>
The first van was driven by&#160;Argus,&#160;our many-eyed&#160;security&#160;chief. The other two were driven by&#160;<br/>
harpies, who are basically&#160;demonic human/chicken hybrids with bad attitudes. We used the harpies&#160;<br/>mostly&#160;for cleaning the camp, but they&#160;did pretty&#160;well&#160;in midtown traffic too.&#160;<br/>
The doors slid&#160;open. A bunch of campers climbed out, some&#160;of them&#160;looking a little green from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
long drive. I&#160;was glad so&#160;many&#160;had come: Pollux,&#160;Silena Beauregard, the Stoll brothers, Michael Yew,&#160;<br/>Jake Mason, Katie Gardner, and Annabeth, along with&#160;most of their siblings. Chiron came out of the van&#160;<br/>last. His horse half was compacted into his magic wheelchair, so he used the handicap lift. The Ares cabin&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;here, but I tried not to&#160;get too&#160;angry about&#160;that.&#160;Clarisse was a stubborn idiot. End&#160;of story.&#160;<br/>
I did a head count: forty&#160;campers in all.&#160;<br/>
Not many&#160;to&#160;fight a war, but it was still the largest&#160;group&#160;of half-bloods I'd ever seen gathered&#160;in one&#160;<br/>
place outside camp. Everyone looked nervous, and I&#160;understood&#160;why.&#160;We were probably&#160;sending out&#160;so&#160;<br/>much demigod aura that every&#160;monster in the northeastern United States knew&#160;we were&#160;here.&#160;<br/>
As I looked at their faces—all these campers I'd known for so&#160;many&#160;summers—a nagging voice&#160;<br/>
whispered in my&#160;mind:&#160;<i>One of them is a&#160;spy.</i>&#160;<br/>
But I couldn't dwell on that. They&#160;were my&#160;friends. I needed them.&#160;<br/>
Then I remembered Kronos's&#160;evil smile.&#160;<i>You can't count&#160;on friends. They will always let you down.</i>&#160;<br/>
Annabeth came up to me. She was dressed in black&#160;camouflage with her Celestial bronze knife&#160;<br/>
strapped to&#160;her arm&#160;and her laptop&#160;bag slung&#160;over&#160;her shoulder—ready&#160;for stabbing&#160;or surfing&#160;the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=72></a>Internet, whichever came first.&#160;<br/>
She frowned.&#160;&#34;What is it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's what?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're looking at me&#160;funny.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I realized<i>&#160;</i>I&#160;was thinking about my&#160;strange vision of&#160;Annabeth pulling me&#160;out of the Styx River. &#34;It's,&#160;<br/>
uh, nothing.&#34;&#160;I turned to&#160;the rest of the group. &#34;Thanks for coming, everybody.&#160;Chiron, after&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My old mentor shook&#160;his&#160;head. &#34;I came&#160;to wish&#160;you luck, my&#160;boy.&#160;But I make it a point&#160;never to visit&#160;<br/>
Olympus unless I am&#160;summoned.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But&#160;you're our leader.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He&#160;smiled. &#34;I am your trainer, your teacher. That is&#160;not the same as being your leader. I will go&#160;gather&#160;<br/>
what allies I&#160;can. It&#160;may&#160;not be too late to&#160;convince my&#160;brother centaurs to help. Meanwhile,&#160;<i>you&#160;</i>called&#160;<br/>the campers here, Percy.&#160;<i>You&#160;</i>are the leader.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to protest, but everybody was looking&#160;at me&#160;expectantly, even Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
I took a deep&#160;breath. &#34;Okay, like I told&#160;Annabeth&#160;on&#160;the phone, something bad is&#160;going to&#160;happen by&#160;<br/>
tonight. Some&#160;kind of&#160;trap. We've got to get an audience with Zeus and convince him&#160;to defend the city.&#160;<br/>Remember,&#160;we can't take&#160;no for an answer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I asked Argus to watch Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;which neither of&#160;them&#160;looked&#160;happy&#160;about.&#160;<br/>
Chiron shook&#160;my&#160;hand.&#160;&#34;You'll do well, Percy.&#160;Just&#160;remember&#160;your&#160;strengths and&#160;beware your&#160;<br/>
weaknesses.&#34;&#160;<br/>
It sounded eerily&#160;close to&#160;what Achilles had told me.&#160;Then I remembered Chiron had&#160;<i>taught&#160;</i>Achilles.&#160;<br/>
That didn't exactly&#160;reassure&#160;me, but I nodded and tried&#160;to give him&#160;a&#160;confident smile.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Let's go,&#34; I told the campers.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
A security&#160;guard was sitting behind the&#160;desk in the lobby,&#160;reading&#160;a big black book with a flower on the&#160;<br/>cover. He glanced up when we&#160;all filed&#160;in with&#160;our weapons and&#160;armor clanking. &#34;School group? We're&#160;<br/>about to close&#160;up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;Six-hundredth floor.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He checked us out. His eyes&#160;were pale blue and&#160;his&#160;head was completely&#160;bald. I&#160;couldn't tell if&#160;he was&#160;<br/>
human or not, but he seemed to notice our weapons, so I guess he wasn't&#160;fooled by the Mist.&#160;<br/>
&#34;There is no&#160;six-hundredth&#160;floor, kid.&#34;&#160;He&#160;said it like it&#160;was a&#160;required line he&#160;didn't believe. &#34;Move&#160;<br/>
along.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I leaned across the desk. &#34;Forty&#160;demigods attract&#160;an awful lot of monsters. You really&#160;want us&#160;<br/>
hanging&#160;out in&#160;your&#160;lobby?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He thought about that. Then&#160;he hit a buzzer and the security gate swung open. &#34;Make it quick.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You don't want us going&#160;through&#160;the metal detectors,&#34; I added.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;no,&#34; he&#160;agreed. &#34;Elevator on the right. I&#160;guess you know the&#160;way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=73></a>I tossed him&#160;a golden&#160;drachma&#160;and we&#160;marched ill rough.&#160;<br/>
We decided it would take&#160;two trips to get everybody&#160;up in the elevator. I went&#160;with the first group.&#160;<br/>
Different elevator music&#160;was playing since my&#160;last visit—that old disco song&#160;&#34;Stayin'&#160;Alive.&#34; A terrifying&#160;<br/>image flashed&#160;through my&#160;mind of Apollo in bell-bottom&#160;pants and a slinky&#160;silk shirt.&#160;<br/>
I was glad when the elevator doors finally&#160;dinged open. In front of us, a path of&#160;floating stones led&#160;<br/>
through the clouds up&#160;to Mount Olympus,&#160;hovering six thousand feet over Manhattan.&#160;<br/>
I'd seen Olympus several&#160;times, but&#160;it still took my&#160;breath away. The mansions glittered&#160;gold and&#160;<br/>
white against&#160;the sides of the&#160;mountain. Gardens bloomed on a hundred terraces.&#160;Scented&#160;smoke rose&#160;<br/>from&#160;braziers&#160;that lined the winding streets. And right at the top&#160;of the snow-capped crest rose the&#160;main&#160;<br/>palace of the gods. It looked as majestic as ever,&#160;but something seemed wrong. Then I&#160;realized the&#160;<br/>mountain was silent—no music, no voices, no laughter.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth studied me. &#34;You&#160;look . .&#160;. different,&#34; she decided. &#34;Where exactly&#160;did&#160;you&#160;go?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The elevator doors opened again, and the second group of half-bloods joined us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tell you later,&#34; I said. &#34;Come on.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We&#160;made our way&#160;across the sky&#160;bridge into the streets of Olympus. The shops were closed. The&#160;<br/>
parks were empty.&#160;A couple of Muses sat on a&#160;bench strumming flaming lyres, but their&#160;hearts didn't&#160;<br/>seem to be in it. A lone Cyclops swept the street&#160;with an uprooted oak tree. A&#160;minor godling spotted us&#160;<br/>from&#160;a balcony and ducked&#160;inside, closing his shutters.&#160;<br/>
We passed under a big&#160;marble archway&#160;with statues&#160;of&#160;Zeus and Hera on either&#160;side. Annabeth made&#160;<br/>
a face&#160;at the queen of the gods.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hate her,&#34; she muttered.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Has&#160;she been&#160;cursing you or something?&#34; I asked. Last year Annabeth had gotten on Hera's&#160;bad side,&#160;<br/>
but Annabeth&#160;hadn't really&#160;talked about it&#160;since.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just little stuff so far,&#34; she said. &#34;Her&#160;sacred animal is&#160;the cow, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Right.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So she sends cows after&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I tried not to&#160;smile. &#34;Cows? In San Francisco?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh,&#160;yeah. Usually I don't see them, but the cows&#160;leave&#160;me&#160;little presents all over the place—in our&#160;<br/>
backyard,&#160;on&#160;the sidewalk, in the school&#160;hallways. I have to be careful where I step.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Look!&#34;&#160;Pollux cried, pointing toward the horizon.&#160;&#34;What is&#160;<i>that?</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
We all froze.&#160;Blue lights were streaking across&#160;the&#160;evening sky&#160;toward Olympus like tiny&#160;comets.&#160;<br/>
They&#160;seemed to be coming from&#160;all over the city,&#160;heading straight toward the&#160;mountain. As they&#160;got&#160;<br/>close, they fizzled<i>&#160;</i>out. We watched them&#160;for several&#160;minutes and&#160;they didn't&#160;seem&#160;to do any&#160;damage, but&#160;<br/>still it was strange.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like infrared scopes,&#34; Michael Yew&#160;muttered. &#34;We're being targeted.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Let's get to the palace,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
No one was guarding&#160;the&#160;hall of the&#160;gods. The gold-and-silver doors stood wide&#160;open. Our footsteps&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=74></a>echoed as we&#160;walked into the throne room.&#160;<br/>
Of course, &#34;room&#34; doesn't really&#160;cover&#160;it. The place was the size&#160;of Madison&#160;Square Garden. High&#160;<br/>
above, the blue ceiling glittered with constellations. Twelve giant empty&#160;thrones stood in a U&#160;around a&#160;<br/>hearth. In one corner, a house-size globe of water hovered in the air, and inside swam&#160;my&#160;old friend the&#160;<br/>Ophiotaurus, half-cow,&#160;half-serpent.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Moooo!&#34;&#160;</i>he&#160;said happily,&#160;turning&#160;in a circle.&#160;<br/>
Despite all the serious stuff going&#160;on, I&#160;had to smile. Two years ago we'd spent a lot of time trying to&#160;<br/>
save the Ophiotaurus from&#160;the Titans, and I'd gotten kind&#160;of fond of&#160;him.&#160;He seemed to like me too, even&#160;<br/>though I'd originally&#160;thought he was a girl and named&#160;him&#160;Bessie.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, man,&#34; I said. &#34;They&#160;treating&#160;you&#160;okay?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Mooo,&#34;&#160;</i>Bessie answered.&#160;<br/>
We walked toward the thrones, and a woman's voice<i>&#160;</i>said, &#34;Hello again, Percy&#160;Jackson. You and&#160;your&#160;<br/>
friends are welcome.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hestia&#160;stood&#160;by&#160;the hearth, poking the flames with a&#160;stick. She wore the same kind of simple brown&#160;<br/>
dress as she had before, but she was a grown woman now.&#160;<br/>
I bowed. &#34;Lady&#160;Hestia.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;friends followed my&#160;example.&#160;<br/>
Hestia regarded me with her red glowing eyes. &#34;I&#160;see&#160;you went through with&#160;your plan. You&#160;bear the&#160;<br/>
curse of Achilles.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The other campers started&#160;muttering among themselves:&#160;<i>What did she say? What about&#160;Achilles?</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;You must be careful,&#34; Hestia warned&#160;me. &#34;You gained&#160;much on&#160;your journey.&#160;But&#160;you are still blind&#160;<br/>
to the most important truth. Perhaps a glimpse is in order.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth nudged me. &#34;Um&#160;. . . what is she talking about?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared into Hestia's eyes, and an image rushed&#160;into&#160;my&#160;mind: I saw a dark alley&#160;between red brick&#160;<br/>
warehouses.&#160;A sign above&#160;one of the doors read RICHMOND IRONWORKS.&#160;<br/>
Two half-bloods crouched in the shadows—a boy&#160;about fourteen and a girl about twelve. I realized&#160;<br/>
with a start that the boy&#160;was Luke. The girl was Thalia, daughter of Zeus. I was seeing a scene from&#160;back&#160;<br/>in the days&#160;when they&#160;were on the run,&#160;before Grover found&#160;them.&#160;<br/>
Luke carried&#160;a bronze knife. Thalia had&#160;her spear&#160;and shield of terror, Aegis.&#160;Luke and Thalia both&#160;<br/>
looked&#160;hungry and lean, with wild animal eyes, like they&#160;were used to being attacked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you sure?&#34;&#160;Thalia asked.&#160;<br/>
Luke nodded.&#160;&#34;Something down here. I&#160;sense it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A rumble&#160;echoed from&#160;the&#160;alley,&#160;like someone had banged on a sheet of&#160;metal.&#160;The half-bloods crept&#160;<br/>
forward.&#160;<br/>
Old crates&#160;were stacked on a loading dock. Thalia and Luke approached with their weapons ready.&#160;A&#160;<br/>
curtain of corrugated tin quivered as&#160;<i>if&#160;</i>something were behind it.&#160;<br/>
Thalia glanced at Luke. He counted silently:&#160;<i>One, two, three!&#160;</i>He ripped away&#160;the tin, and a little girl&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=75></a>flew at him&#160;with a hammer.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Whoa!&#34; Luke&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
The girl had tangled blond&#160;hair and was wearing flannel pajamas.&#160;She couldn't have been&#160;more than&#160;<br/>
seven, but she would've brained Luke if&#160;he hadn't been so fast.&#160;<br/>
He grabbed her wrist, and the&#160;hammer skittered across the cement.&#160;<br/>
The little girl&#160;fought&#160;and kicked. &#34;No more&#160;monsters!&#160;Go away!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's okay!&#34; Luke struggled&#160;to hold her. &#34;Thalia, put&#160;your shield up.&#160;You're scaring her.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia tapped Aegis, and it&#160;shrank into a&#160;silver bracelet. &#34;Hey,&#160;it's all right,&#34; she said. &#34;We're not&#160;<br/>
going&#160;to hurt&#160;you. I'm&#160;Thalia. This is Luke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Monsters!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; Luke promised. &#34;But we know all&#160;about monsters. We fight them&#160;too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Slowly, the girl stopped kicking. She studied Luke&#160;and Thalia with large intelligent gray&#160;eyes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're like&#160;me?&#34;&#160;she said&#160;suspiciously.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#34; Luke said. &#34;We're&#160;. . . well, it's hard to&#160;explain, but we're&#160;monster fighters. Where's your&#160;<br/>
family?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;My family&#160;hates&#160;me,&#34; the girl said.&#160;&#34;They&#160;don't want me. I ran away.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia and Luke locked eyes. I knew they&#160;both related to what she was saying.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's your&#160;name, kiddo?&#34; Thalia asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Luke smiled. &#34;Nice name. I tell&#160;you&#160;what, Annabeth—you're pretty&#160;fierce. We could use a fighter like&#160;<br/>
you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth's&#160;eyes widened.&#160;&#34;You could?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, yeah.&#34;&#160;Luke turned his knife and&#160;offered her&#160;the handle. &#34;How'd&#160;you like a real&#160;monster-slaying&#160;<br/>
weapon? This&#160;is Celestial bronze.&#160;Works a lot better than a hammer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Maybe&#160;under&#160;most circumstances, offering a seven-year-old kid a&#160;knife would&#160;not be a good idea, but&#160;<br/>
when you're a half-blood, regular rules kind of&#160;go&#160;out&#160;the window.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth gripped the hilt.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Knives are only&#160;for the bravest and quickest fighters,&#34; Luke explained. &#34;They&#160;don't have the reach or&#160;<br/>
power of a sword, but they're easy&#160;to conceal and they&#160;can find weak spots in your enemy's armor. It takes&#160;<br/>a clever warrior to use a knife. I have a feeling&#160;you're pretty clever.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth stared at him&#160;with adoration.&#160;&#34;I&#160;am!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia grinned. &#34;We'd better get&#160;going,&#160;Annabeth. We have a safe&#160;house on the&#160;James River.&#160;We'll get&#160;<br/>
you some&#160;clothes and food.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're . . .&#160;you're not going&#160;to take me&#160;back to my&#160;family?&#34; she said. &#34;Promise?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Luke put&#160;his hand on&#160;her shoulder. &#34;You're part of&#160;<i>our&#160;</i>family&#160;now. And I promise I&#160;won't let anything&#160;<br/>
hurt you.&#160;I'm&#160;<i>not&#160;</i>going&#160;to fail you like our families did us. Deal?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=76></a>&#34;Deal!&#34; Annabeth said happily.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Now, come&#160;on,&#34; Thalia said. &#34;We can't&#160;stay&#160;put for long!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The scene shifted. The three demigods were running&#160;through the&#160;woods. It must've been several days&#160;<br/>
later,&#160;maybe even weeks. All of&#160;them looked beat up, like they'd&#160;seen some battles. Annabeth was&#160;<br/>wearing new&#160;clothes—jeans and an oversize army&#160;jacket.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just a little farther!&#34; Luke promised. Annabeth&#160;stumbled, and he took&#160;her hand. Thalia&#160;brought&#160;up&#160;<br/>
the rear, brandishing&#160;her shield like she was driving&#160;back whatever&#160;pursued them. She&#160;was limping on her&#160;<br/>left leg.&#160;<br/>
They&#160;scrambled to a ridge and looked down the other side&#160;at a white&#160;Colonial house—May&#160;<br/>
Castellan's place.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right,&#34;&#160;Luke said, breathing hard.&#160;&#34;I'll just sneak in and&#160;grab some food and medicine. Wait&#160;<br/>
here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke, are&#160;you sure?&#34; Thalia asked. &#34;You swore&#160;you'd never come&#160;back here. If she catches you—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We don't have a&#160;choice!&#34; he growled.&#160;&#34;They&#160;burned&#160;our nearest safe house. And&#160;you've got&#160;to treat&#160;<br/>
that leg wound.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;This is&#160;your&#160;house?&#34; Annabeth said with amazement.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It&#160;<i>was&#160;</i>my&#160;house,&#34; Luke&#160;muttered. &#34;Believe&#160;me, if it wasn't an emergency—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is your mom really&#160;horrible?&#34; Annabeth&#160;asked. &#34;Can we see her?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; Luke snapped.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth shrank away&#160;from&#160;him&#160;as though&#160;his anger surprised her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I . . . I'm sorry,&#34; he said. &#34;Just wait here. I promise&#160;everything will&#160;be okay.&#160;Nothing's going&#160;to hurt&#160;<br/>
you. I'll be back—&#34;&#160;<br/>
A brilliant golden flash illuminated the woods.&#160;The&#160;demigods winced,&#160;and a man's&#160;voice<i>&#160;&#160;</i>boomed:&#160;<br/>
&#34;You should&#160;not have come home.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The vision shut off.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;knees buckled, but Annabeth grabbed me. &#34;Percy! What happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Did . . .&#160;did&#160;you see that?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;See what?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I glanced at&#160;Hestia, but the goddess's face was&#160;expressionless. I remembered something she'd told me&#160;<br/>
in the woods:&#160;<i>If you&#160;are to understand&#160;your enemy&#160;Luke, you must understand his family.&#160;</i>But&#160;why&#160;had&#160;<br/>she shown me those scenes?&#160;<br/>
&#34;How long was I out?&#34; I muttered.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth knit her eyebrows. &#34;Percy,&#160;you&#160;weren't out&#160;at all. You just&#160;looked at Hestia for like one&#160;<br/>
second and collapsed.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I could feel everyone's&#160;eyes on me. I couldn't afford&#160;to look&#160;weak. Whatever those visions meant, I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=77></a>had to stay&#160;focused on our&#160;mission.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;Lady&#160;Hestia,&#34; I said, &#34;we've come&#160;on urgent business. We need&#160;to see—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We know what you need,&#34; a&#160;man's voice said. I shuddered, because it was the same voice I'd heard&#160;<br/>
in the vision.&#160;<br/>
A god shimmered into existence next to Hestia.&#160;He looked about twenty-five, with curly salt-and-<br/>
pepper hair and elfish features. He wore a&#160;military&#160;pilot's flight suit, with tiny bird's&#160;wings&#160;fluttering&#160;on&#160;<br/>his helmet&#160;and his black leather boots. In the crook of&#160;his arm was a long staff&#160;entwined with two living&#160;<br/>serpents.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will leave you now,&#34; Hestia&#160;said.&#160;She bowed&#160;to the aviator and disappeared into smoke.&#160;I&#160;<br/>
understood why&#160;she was so anxious to go. Hermes,&#160;the God of Messengers, did not look happy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hello, Percy.&#34; His brow furrowed&#160;as though he&#160;was annoyed&#160;with&#160;me,&#160;and I wondered if he&#160;<br/>
somehow knew about the vision I'd just&#160;had. I wanted&#160;to ask why&#160;he'd&#160;been in May&#160;Castellan's house that&#160;<br/>night, and what had happened after he&#160;caught Luke. I remembered the first time I'd&#160;met Luke at Camp&#160;<br/>Half-Blood. I'd asked him&#160;if he'd&#160;ever&#160;met his father,&#160;and he'd&#160;looked at me&#160;bitterly and said,&#160;<i>Once.&#160;</i>But I&#160;<br/>could tell from&#160;Hermes's expression that this was not the time to ask.&#160;<br/>
I bowed awkwardly.&#160;&#34;Lord Hermes.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Oh, sure,&#160;</i>one of the snakes said in my&#160;mind.&#160;<i>Don't say&#160;hi to&#160;</i>us.&#160;<i>We're just reptiles.</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>George,&#160;</i>the other snake scolded.&#160;<i>Be polite.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hello, George,&#34; I said. &#34;Hey, Martha.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Did you bring us a rat?&#160;</i>George asked.&#160;<br/>
<i>George, stop it,&#160;</i>Martha said.&#160;<i>He's&#160;busy!</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Too busy for rats?&#160;</i>George said.&#160;<i>That's just sad.</i>&#160;<br/>
I decided it&#160;was better not to&#160;get into it&#160;with George.&#160;&#34;Um,&#160;Hermes,&#34; I said. &#34;We&#160;need to talk to&#160;Zeus.&#160;<br/>
It's&#160;important.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes's&#160;eyes were&#160;steely&#160;cold. &#34;I am&#160;his&#160;messenger.&#160;May&#160;I take a&#160;message?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Behind&#160;me, the other demigods shifted restlessly. This wasn't&#160;going as planned. Maybe if I tried to&#160;<br/>
speak with Hermes in private . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;You guys,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Why don't you do&#160;a sweep of the city? Check the defenses. See who's left in&#160;<br/>
Olympus. Meet Annabeth and me&#160;back here in thirty&#160;minutes.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena frowned. &#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's a good idea,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Connor and Travis, you two&#160;lead.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Stolls seemed to like&#160;that—getting&#160;handed an important responsibility&#160;right&#160;in front of&#160;their dad.&#160;<br/>
They&#160;usually never led anything except&#160;toilet paper raids. &#34;We're&#160;on it!&#34; Travis said. They herded the&#160;<br/>others out of&#160;the throne room, leaving Annabeth and&#160;me with Hermes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My lord,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;&#34;Kronos is&#160;going&#160;to attack&#160;New York. You must suspect that. My&#160;<i>mother&#160;</i><br/>
must have foreseen it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your mother,&#34; Hermes grumbled.&#160;He&#160;scratched his back with his&#160;caduceus, and George and Martha&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=78></a>muttered&#160;<i>Ow, ow, ow</i>.&#160;&#34;Don't&#160;get me started on&#160;your&#160;mother, young lady. She's the reason I'm&#160;here&#160;at all.&#160;<br/>Zeus didn't want any&#160;of us&#160;to leave the front line. But your mother&#160;kept pestering him&#160;nonstop, 'It's&#160;a trap,&#160;<br/>it's a diversion, blah,&#160;blah, blah.' She wanted to come back herself, but Zeus&#160;was not going&#160;to let his&#160;<br/>number one strategist leave his side while we're battling Typhon.&#160;And so&#160;naturally he sent&#160;<i>me&#160;</i>to talk to&#160;<br/>you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But it&#160;<i>is&#160;</i>a trap!&#34; Annabeth insisted. &#34;Is Zeus blind?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thunder rolled through the&#160;sky.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'd watch the comments, girl,&#34; Hermes&#160;warned. &#34;Zeus is not blind&#160;<i>or&#160;</i>deaf. He has not left&#160;Olympus&#160;<br/>
completely&#160;undefended.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But there are&#160;these blue lights—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, yes. I saw them. Some&#160;mischief&#160;by&#160;that insufferable goddess of&#160;magic,&#160;Hecate, I'd wager, but&#160;<br/>
you may&#160;have&#160;noticed they&#160;aren't&#160;doing&#160;any&#160;damage.&#160;Olympus has&#160;strong magical wards. Besides, Aeolus,&#160;<br/>the King of the Winds, has sent his&#160;most powerful&#160;minions to guard the citadel. No one save the gods can&#160;<br/>approach Olympus from&#160;the air. They&#160;would&#160;be knocked out&#160;of the&#160;sky.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I raised&#160;my&#160;hand. &#34;Um&#160;. . . what about that&#160;materializing/teleporting thing&#160;you guys do?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's a form&#160;of air<i>&#160;</i>travel&#160;too, Jackson. Very&#160;fast, but the wind&#160;gods are faster. No, if Kronos wants&#160;<br/>
Olympus, he'll have to&#160;march through the entire city&#160;with his army&#160;and take the elevators!&#160;Can you see&#160;<br/>him&#160;doing this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes&#160;made it sound&#160;pretty&#160;ridiculous—hordes of&#160;monsters going up&#160;in&#160;the&#160;elevator twenty&#160;at a&#160;<br/>
time, listening to &#34;Stayin'&#160;Alive.&#34; Still,&#160;I didn't like it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maybe just a few of you could come&#160;back,&#34; I suggested.&#160;<br/>
Hermes shook his head impatiently. &#34;Percy&#160;Jackson, you don't&#160;understand.&#160;Typhon is our greatest&#160;<br/>
enemy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I thought that was Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The god's eyes glowed. &#34;No, Percy.&#160;In the old days, Olympus was almost overthrown by&#160;Typhon. He&#160;<br/>
is husband of&#160;Echidna—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Met her at the Arch,&#34; I&#160;muttered. &#34;Not nice.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;—and the father of all monsters.&#160;We can never forget how close he&#160;came to destroying&#160;us all; how he&#160;<br/>
humiliated us! We were&#160;more powerful&#160;back in the&#160;old days. Now&#160;we can expect no&#160;help from&#160;Poseidon&#160;<br/>because he's&#160;fighting his own war.&#160;Hades sits&#160;in&#160;his realm and does nothing, and Demeter&#160;and Persephone&#160;<br/>follow his lead. It will take all our remaining power to&#160;oppose the storm giant. We&#160;can't&#160;divide our forces,&#160;<br/>nor wait until he gets to New York. We have&#160;to battle him&#160;now. And we're&#160;making progress.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Progress?&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;He nearly destroyed&#160;St. Louis.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#34; Hermes admitted. &#34;But he destroyed only&#160;<i>half&#160;&#160;</i>of Kentucky.&#160;He's&#160;slowing down.&#160;Losing&#160;<br/>
power.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't want to argue, but&#160;it&#160;sounded like&#160;Hermes was trying to&#160;convince himself.&#160;<br/>
In the corner, the Ophiotaurus mooed sadly.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=79></a>&#34;Please,&#160;Hermes,&#34;&#160;Annabeth said. &#34;You said&#160;my&#160;mother&#160;wanted to come.&#160;Did she give&#160;you any&#160;<br/>
messages for&#160;us?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Messages,&#34; he muttered. &#34;'It'll be a great job,' they told me.&#160;'Not&#160;much work. Lots of<i>&#160;</i>worshippers.'&#160;<br/>
Hmph. Nobody&#160;cares what&#160;<i>I</i>&#160;have to say.&#160;It's&#160;always&#160;about&#160;other people's&#160;<i>messages.</i>”&#160;<br/>
<i>Rodents,&#160;</i>George mused.&#160;<i>I'm in it for the&#160;rodents.</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Shhh,&#160;</i>Martha scolded. We&#160;<i>care what Hermes has to say. Don't&#160;we, George?</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>Oh, absolutely. Can we go&#160;back to the battle now? I&#160;want to&#160;do laser mode again. That's fun.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Quiet, both&#160;of&#160;you,&#34; Hermes grumbled.&#160;<br/>
The god looked at Annabeth, who was doing&#160;her big-pleading-gray-eyes thing.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bah,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;Your mother said to warn&#160;you that&#160;you&#160;are on your&#160;own. You must hold&#160;<br/>
Manhattan without the help of the gods. As if I&#160;didn't know that. Why&#160;they&#160;pay&#160;her to be the&#160;<i>wisdom&#160;<br/></i>goddess, I'm&#160;not sure.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Anything&#160;else?&#34; Annabeth&#160;asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;She said&#160;you&#160;should try plan twenty-three. She said you would know&#160;what that meant.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth's&#160;face paled. Obviously&#160;she knew what it&#160;meant, and she didn't like it.&#160;&#34;Go on.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Last thing.&#34;&#160;Hermes looked at me.&#160;&#34;She said to&#160;tell Percy:&#160;'Remember the rivers.'&#160;And, um,&#160;<br/>
something about staying&#160;away&#160;from&#160;her daughter.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I'm not sure whose face&#160;was redder: Annabeth's or&#160;mine.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thank&#160;you,&#160;Hermes,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;And I . . .&#160;I&#160;wanted to say .&#160;. . I'm&#160;sorry&#160;about Luke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The god's expression hardened like he'd&#160;turned to marble. &#34;You should've left that subject alone.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth stepped back nervously.&#160;&#34;Sorry?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;SORRY doesn't&#160;cut it!&#34;&#160;<br/>
George and&#160;Martha curled around the&#160;caduceus, which shimmered and changed into something that&#160;<br/>
looked suspiciously&#160;like a&#160;high-voltage&#160;cattle prod.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You should've saved him when&#160;you&#160;had the chance,&#34; Hermes growled at Annabeth. &#34;You're the only&#160;<br/>
one who could have.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I tried to step&#160;between them. &#34;What are you talking about? Annabeth didn't—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't defend her, Jackson!&#34; Hermes turned the cattle prod toward me. &#34;She knows exactly what I'm&#160;<br/>
talking about.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maybe&#160;you&#160;should blame yourself!&#34; I should've kept&#160;my&#160;mouth shut, but all I could think about was&#160;<br/>
turning his attention away from&#160;Annabeth. This whole time, he&#160;hadn't been&#160;angry&#160;with me. He'd&#160;been&#160;<br/>angry&#160;with&#160;<i>her.&#160;</i>&#34;Maybe if&#160;you&#160;hadn't abandoned Luke&#160;and his mom!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes raised his cattle prod. He began&#160;to grow until&#160;he was ten feet tall. I thought, Well, that's&#160;it.&#160;<br/>
But as he prepared to strike, George and Martha leaned&#160;in close and whispered something in his ear.&#160;<br/>
Hermes clenched his teeth.&#160;He lowered the cattle prod, and it turned back to a staff.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34; he said, &#34;because you have taken on&#160;the curse of&#160;Achilles, I&#160;must spare you. You are&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=80></a>in the hands&#160;of the Fates now. But&#160;you will&#160;<i>never&#160;&#160;</i>speak to me&#160;like that again. You have&#160;no idea how&#160;<br/>much I have sacrificed, how&#160;much—&#34;&#160;<br/>
His voice broke, and he shrank back to human size. &#34;My&#160;son, my&#160;greatest pride . . . my&#160;poor&#160;May&#160;.&#160;. .&#34;&#160;<br/>
He sounded so devastated I didn't know what to say. One&#160;minute he&#160;was ready&#160;to&#160;vaporize us. Now he&#160;<br/>
looked like he&#160;needed a hug.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Look, Lord&#160;Hermes,&#34; I said. &#34;I'm&#160;sorry,&#160;but I&#160;need to know.&#160;What happened to May?&#160;She said&#160;<br/>
something about Luke's&#160;fate, and her eyes—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes glared&#160;at&#160;me, and my&#160;voice faltered. The look on his face wasn't really&#160;anger, though. It was&#160;<br/>
pain. Deep, incredible pain.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will leave you&#160;now,&#34; he&#160;said tightly.&#160;&#34;I&#160;have a war to fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He began to&#160;shine. I turned away&#160;and made sure&#160;Annabeth did the same, because she&#160;was still frozen&#160;<br/>
in shock.&#160;<br/>
<i>Good luck, Percy,&#160;</i>Martha the snake whispered.&#160;<br/>
Hermes glowed with the light of a supernova. Then&#160;he&#160;was gone.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Annabeth sat at the foot of&#160;her&#160;mother's throne and cried. I wanted to comfort her, but I wasn't&#160;sure how.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth,&#34; I said, &#34;it's not&#160;your fault. I've never seen Hermes&#160;act that&#160;way.&#160;I&#160;guess . . . I don't know .&#160;<br/>
. . he probably&#160;feels guilty about Luke. He's&#160;looking for somebody to blame. I don't know why&#160;he lashed&#160;<br/>out at&#160;you. You didn't do anything&#160;to&#160;deserve that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth wiped her eyes. She stared at&#160;the hearth like it was her own funeral pyre.&#160;<br/>
I shifted uneasily.&#160;&#34;Um,&#160;you didn't, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She didn't answer.&#160;Her&#160;Celestial bronze&#160;knife was&#160;strapped to her arm—the same knife I'd&#160;seen in&#160;<br/>
Hestia's vision. All these&#160;years, I&#160;hadn't&#160;realized&#160;it&#160;was&#160;a gift from Luke. I'd&#160;asked her&#160;many&#160;times why&#160;<br/>she preferred&#160;to fight with&#160;a knife instead of a&#160;sword,&#160;and she'd never answered me. Now I knew.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; she said. &#34;What did&#160;you mean about Luke's&#160;mother? Did you meet her?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded reluctantly. &#34;Nico and I&#160;visited her. She&#160;was a little . .&#160;. different.&#34; I&#160;described May&#160;<br/>
Castellan, and the weird moment when her eyes had&#160;started to glow&#160;and she talked about&#160;her son's fate.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth frowned. &#34;That doesn't&#160;make sense. But&#160;why&#160;were you visiting—&#34;&#160;Her eyes widened.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hermes said you bear the curse of Achilles. Hestia said the same&#160;thing.&#160;Did&#160;you&#160;. . . did&#160;you&#160;bathe in the&#160;<br/>River Styx?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't change the subject.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy! Did&#160;you or&#160;not?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um&#160;. . . maybe a little.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I told her the story&#160;about Hades&#160;and Nico, and how I'd defeated&#160;an army&#160;of the dead. I left&#160;out the&#160;<br/>
vision of her pulling me out of the river. I still didn't&#160;quite understand that part, and just thinking about it&#160;<br/>made me&#160;embarrassed.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=81></a>She shook&#160;her head in disbelief. &#34;Do you have&#160;<i>any idea&#160;</i>how dangerous that was?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I had no choice,&#34; I said. &#34;It's the only&#160;way&#160;I can stand up to Luke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You mean&#160;<i>.&#160;. . di immortales,&#160;</i>of course! That's why&#160;Luke didn't die. He went to the Styx and . . . Oh&#160;<br/>
no, Luke. What were you thinking?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So now&#160;you're worried about Luke again,&#34; I grumbled.&#160;<br/>
She stared at&#160;me like I'd just dropped from&#160;space. &#34;What?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Forget it,&#34; I&#160;muttered. I&#160;wondered what Hermes had&#160;meant&#160;about&#160;Annabeth not saving Luke when&#160;<br/>
she'd had the chance. Clearly, she wasn't&#160;telling me&#160;something. But&#160;at the moment I wasn't&#160;in the mood to&#160;<br/>ask. The last thing I wanted&#160;to hear about&#160;was&#160;more of&#160;her history&#160;with Luke.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The point is&#160;he didn't die in the Styx,&#34; I said. &#34;Neither did I. Now I have&#160;to face him.&#160;We&#160;have to&#160;<br/>
defend Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth was still studying my&#160;face, like she was&#160;trying to see differences&#160;since&#160;my&#160;swim&#160;in the&#160;<br/>
Styx.&#160;&#34;I guess you're&#160;right. My&#160;mom&#160;mentioned—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Plan twenty-three.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She rummaged in her&#160;pack and&#160;pulled&#160;out Daedalus's&#160;laptop. The blue Delta symbol glowed on&#160;the&#160;<br/>
top when she&#160;booted it&#160;up.&#160;She opened a&#160;few files and&#160;started to read.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Here it is,&#34; she said. &#34;Gods, we have a lot of work to&#160;do.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;One of Daedalus's inventions?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;A lot of&#160;inventions .&#160;. .&#160;dangerous ones. If my&#160;mother wants me to use this&#160;plan, she must think&#160;<br/>
things are very bad.&#34; She&#160;looked at me. &#34;What about her message to&#160;you: 'Remember the rivers'?&#160;What&#160;<br/>does that mean?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I shook my&#160;head. As usual, I had no clue what the gods were telling&#160;me. Which&#160;rivers was I supposed&#160;<br/>
to remember?&#160;The Styx?&#160;The Mississippi?&#160;<br/>
Just then the&#160;Stoll brothers ran in to the throne room.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You need to&#160;see this,&#34; Connor said.&#160;<i>&#34;Now.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The blue lights in the sky&#160;had stopped, so&#160;at first I didn't&#160;understand what the problem&#160;was.&#160;<br/>
The other campers had gathered in a small park at&#160;the edge of the&#160;mountain.&#160;They were clustered at&#160;<br/>
the guardrail,&#160;looking down at Manhattan. The railing was lined with those tourist binoculars, where you&#160;<br/>could deposit one golden drachma&#160;and see the&#160;city. Campers&#160;were&#160;using every&#160;single one.&#160;<br/>
I looked down at the city.&#160;I could see almost everything from&#160;here—the East River and the Hudson&#160;<br/>
River carving the shape of Manhattan, the grid of&#160;streets, the lights of skyscrapers, the dark stretch of&#160;<br/>Central Park in the north.&#160;Everything&#160;looked&#160;normal, but something was wrong. I felt it&#160;in&#160;my&#160;bones&#160;<br/>before I realized what it<i>&#160;</i>was.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't . . .&#160;hear anything,&#34;&#160;Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>
That was the&#160;problem.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=82></a>Even from&#160;this height, I should've heard the noise of the city—millions of&#160;people bustling&#160;around,&#160;<br/>
thousands of&#160;cars and&#160;machines—the hum&#160;of a huge&#160;metropolis. You don't think&#160;about it&#160;when&#160;you live in&#160;<br/>New York, but it's always&#160;there. Even in the dead of night, New York is never silent.&#160;<br/>
But it was now.&#160;<br/>
I felt like my&#160;best friend had suddenly dropped dead.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What did they do?&#34; My&#160;voice sounded tight and angry. &#34;What did&#160;they&#160;do to&#160;my&#160;city?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I pushed Michael Yew&#160;away&#160;from&#160;the binoculars and took a look.&#160;<br/>
In the streets below, traffic had stopped. Pedestrians were lying&#160;on the sidewalks, or curled up in&#160;<br/>
doorways. There&#160;was no sign of violence, no wrecks, nothing like that. It was&#160;as if&#160;all the people in New&#160;<br/>York had simply&#160;decided<i>&#160;</i>to&#160;stop whatever they&#160;were doing&#160;and pass&#160;out.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are they&#160;dead?&#34; Silena asked in astonishment.&#160;<br/>
Ice coated my&#160;stomach. A line&#160;from&#160;the prophecy&#160;rang&#160;in my&#160;ears:&#160;<i>And see the&#160;world in endless sleep.&#160;</i><br/>
I remembered Grover's story&#160;about meeting the god Morpheus in Central Park.&#160;<i>You're lucky I'm saving my&#160;</i><br/>
<i>energy for the main event.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not dead,&#34; I said. &#34;Morpheus has put the entire island of Manhattan to sleep. The invasion has&#160;<br/>
started.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
TEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;BUY &#160;SOME &#160;NEW&#160;<br/>
FRIENDS&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;was the only&#160;one happy about the sleeping city.&#160;<br/>
We found her pigging out&#160;at an overturned hot&#160;dog&#160;stand while the owner was curled up on the&#160;<br/>
sidewalk, sucking&#160;his thumb.&#160;<br/>
Argus was waiting for us with his hundred eyes wide&#160;open. He didn't say&#160;anything. He never does.&#160;I&#160;<br/>
guess that's&#160;because he supposedly&#160;has an eyeball on his tongue. But his face&#160;made it&#160;clear he&#160;was&#160;<br/>freaking out.&#160;<br/>
I told&#160;him&#160;what we'd<i>&#160;</i>learned in Olympus, and how the&#160;gods would&#160;not be riding&#160;to the rescue. Argus&#160;<br/>
rolled his eyes in disgust,&#160;which looked&#160;pretty&#160;psychedelic since it made his whole body swirl.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You'd better get back to camp,&#34; I told him.&#160;&#34;Guard it as best you can.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He pointed at me and raised&#160;his eyebrow quizzically<i>.&#160;</i><br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;staying,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Argus nodded, like this answer satisfied&#160;him.&#160;He looked&#160;at Annabeth and drew a circle in the air with&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=83></a>his finger.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#34; Annabeth agreed. &#34;I think&#160;it's time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;For what?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
Argus rummaged around&#160;in the back of his van. He brought&#160;out a bronze shield and passed it to&#160;<br/>
Annabeth. It&#160;looked&#160;pretty&#160;much standard issue—the same&#160;kind of round shield we always&#160;used in&#160;<br/>capture the flag. But when Annabeth set it on the&#160;ground, the reflection on the&#160;polished&#160;metal changed&#160;<br/>from&#160;sky&#160;and&#160;buildings to the Statue of&#160;Liberty—which wasn't&#160;anywhere close to us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Whoa,&#34; I said. &#34;A video shield.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;One of Daedalus's&#160;ideas,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;I had Beckendorf&#160;make this before—&#34; She glanced at&#160;<br/>
Silena. &#34;Um,&#160;anyway, the&#160;shield bends sunlight or&#160;moonlight from&#160;anywhere in the world to create&#160;a&#160;<br/>reflection. You can literally see any&#160;target under the sun or moon, as long as natural light is&#160;touching it.&#160;<br/>Look.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We crowded around as Annabeth concentrated. The image zoomed and spun&#160;at first, so I got&#160;motion&#160;<br/>
sickness just&#160;watching it. We were in&#160;the Central Park Zoo,&#160;then zooming down East 60th, past&#160;<br/>Bloomingdale's, then turning on&#160;Third&#160;Avenue.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Whoa,&#34; Connor Stoll&#160;said. &#34;Back up. Zoom&#160;in right there.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; Annabeth said nervously.&#160;&#34;You&#160;see invaders?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, right&#160;there—Dylan's&#160;Candy Bar.&#34;&#160;Connor&#160;grinned at his brother. &#34;Dude, it's&#160;open. And&#160;<i>everyone&#160;</i><br/>
is asleep. Are&#160;you thinking&#160;what I'm thinking?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Connor!&#34; Katie Gardner&#160;scolded. She sounded like&#160;her&#160;mother, Demeter. &#34;This is serious.&#160;You are&#160;<br/>
not going&#160;to loot a candy&#160;store in the middle of a war!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sorry,&#34; Connor muttered, but he&#160;didn't sound&#160;very ashamed.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth passed her hand in front of the shield, and another scene popped&#160;up:&#160;FDR Drive, looking&#160;<br/>
across the river at Lighthouse Park.&#160;<br/>
&#34;This will let us see what's going&#160;on across the city,&#34; she said. &#34;Thank&#160;you,&#160;Argus. Hopefully&#160;we'll&#160;<br/>
see you&#160;back at camp&#160;. . . someday.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Argus grunted. He gave&#160;me a look that&#160;clearly&#160;meant&#160;<i>Good luck; you'll need it,&#160;</i>then climbed&#160;into his&#160;<br/>
van. He and the two harpy&#160;drivers swerved away, weaving around clusters of&#160;idle cars that&#160;littered the&#160;<br/>road.&#160;<br/>
I whistled for Mrs. O'Leary, and she came bounding&#160;over.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, girl,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;You remember Grover?&#160;The satyr&#160;we&#160;met in the park?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;WOOF!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
I hoped that&#160;meant&#160;<i>Sure I&#160;do!&#160;</i>And not,&#160;<i>Do</i>&#160;<i>you have&#160;more hot dogs?</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;I need you to&#160;find him,&#34; I said. &#34;Make&#160;sure he's&#160;still&#160;awake. We're going to need his help. You got&#160;<br/>
that? Find&#160;Grover!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;gave me a sloppy wet kiss, which seemed kind of&#160;unnecessary.&#160;Then she raced off&#160;<br/>
north.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=84></a>Pollux crouched next to a sleeping policeman. &#34;I don't get it. Why&#160;didn't we fall asleep too? Why&#160;just&#160;<br/>
the mortals?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;This is a huge spell,&#34; Silena Beauregard said. &#34;The&#160;bigger the spell, the easier it is to resist. If you&#160;<br/>
want to sleep&#160;millions of mortals, you've got to cast a very&#160;thin&#160;layer of magic. Sleeping demigods is&#160;<br/>much harder.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at her. &#34;When did&#160;you learn so much about magic?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena blushed. &#34;I don't spend&#160;<i>all&#160;</i>my&#160;time on my&#160;wardrobe.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth called. She was still&#160;looking at the&#160;shield. &#34;You'd better see this.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The bronze image&#160;showed&#160;Long Island Sound near La&#160;Guardia. A&#160;fleet of&#160;a dozen speedboats raced&#160;<br/>
through the dark water toward Manhattan. Each boat&#160;was packed&#160;with demigods in full Greek armor. At&#160;<br/>the back of the lead boat,&#160;a purple banner emblazoned with a black scythe flapped&#160;m&#160;the night wind. I'd&#160;<br/>never seen that design before, but it wasn't&#160;hard to figure out: the&#160;battle flag of&#160;Kronos.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Scan the perimeter of the island,&#34; I said. &#34;Quick.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth shifted the scene south to the harbor. A&#160;Staten Island Ferry&#160;was plowing through the waves&#160;<br/>
near Ellis Island. The&#160;deck was crowded with&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;</i>and&#160;a&#160;whole pack of&#160;hellhounds.&#160;Swimming in&#160;<br/>front of the ship was a pod of marine&#160;mammals. At first I thought they&#160;were dolphins. Then&#160;I saw their&#160;<br/>doglike faces and the swords strapped to their waists,&#160;and I realized they&#160;were telkhines—sea&#160;demons.&#160;<br/>
The scene shifted again: the Jersey&#160;shore, right&#160;at&#160;the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. A&#160;hundred&#160;<br/>
assorted&#160;monsters&#160;were&#160;marching past the lanes of<i>&#160;</i>stopped traffic: giants with&#160;clubs, rogue Cyclopes, a&#160;<br/>few fire-spitting dragons, and just to rub it in, a World War II-era Sherman tank, pushing cars out&#160;of its&#160;<br/>way&#160;as it rumbled into&#160;the tunnel.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's happening with the&#160;mortals outside Manhattan?&#34; I said. &#34;Is the whole state asleep?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth frowned. &#34;I don't think so, but it's strange. As far&#160;as I can tell&#160;from these&#160;pictures,&#160;<br/>
Manhattan is&#160;totally&#160;asleep. Then there's like a fifty-mile radius around&#160;the island where time is running&#160;<br/>really, really&#160;slow. The closer you get to Manhattan, the slower it is.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She showed&#160;me another scene—a New&#160;Jersey&#160;highway.&#160;It&#160;was Saturday&#160;evening,&#160;so the traffic wasn't&#160;<br/>
as bad as it&#160;might've been on a weekday.&#160;The drivers looked awake, but the cars&#160;were&#160;moving at about&#160;<br/>one mile per&#160;hour. Birds flew overhead in slow motion.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Kronos,&#34; I said. &#34;He's slowing time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hecate&#160;might be&#160;helping,&#34; Katie Gardner said. &#34;Look how the cars are all veering away&#160;from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
Manhattan exits, like they're getting a subconscious message to turn back.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know.&#34; Annabeth sounded really&#160;frustrated. She&#160;<i>hated&#160;</i>not knowing.&#160;&#34;But somehow they've&#160;<br/>
surrounded&#160;Manhattan in layers of magic. The outside world might not even realize<i>&#160;</i>something is wrong.&#160;<br/>Any&#160;mortals coming toward Manhattan&#160;will slow down&#160;so much they&#160;won't know what's happening.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like flies in amber,&#34; Jake&#160;Mason murmured.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth nodded. &#34;We shouldn't expect any&#160;help coming in.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I turned to my&#160;friends. They&#160;looked stunned and scared, and I couldn't blame&#160;them. The shield had&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=85></a>shown us at least three hundred enemies&#160;on the way.&#160;There were forty of us. And&#160;we were&#160;alone.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;We're going&#160;to hold&#160;Manhattan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena tugged&#160;at her armor. &#34;Um,&#160;Percy,&#160;Manhattan is huge.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We&#160;<i>are&#160;</i>going&#160;to hold it,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;We have to.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He's right,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;The gods of the&#160;wind should&#160;keep Kronos's&#160;forces away&#160;from&#160;Olympus&#160;<br/>
by&#160;air, so he'll try&#160;a ground assault. We&#160;have to cut off the entrances to the island.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;They have boats,&#34; Michael Yew pointed out.&#160;<br/>
An electric tingle went down my&#160;back. Suddenly I understood Athena's&#160;advice:&#160;<i>Remember&#160;the rivers.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll take care&#160;of the boats,&#34;&#160;I said.&#160;<br/>
Michael frowned. &#34;How?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just leave it&#160;to me,&#34; I said. &#34;We need to guard&#160;the&#160;bridges and tunnels. Let's assume they'll try&#160;a&#160;<br/>
midtown or downtown assault, at least&#160;on their first try.&#160;That would be the most&#160;direct way&#160;to the Empire&#160;<br/>State Building. Michael, take Apollo's&#160;cabin to the Williamsburg Bridge. Katie,&#160;Demeter's cabin takes the&#160;<br/>Brooklyn-Battery&#160;Tunnel.&#160;Grow thorn&#160;bushes and poison ivy<i>&#160;</i>in&#160;the&#160;tunnel.&#160;Do&#160;whatever you&#160;have to&#160;do,&#160;<br/>but keep them&#160;out of there! Conner, take half of&#160;Hermes&#160;cabin and cover the Manhattan Bridge. Travis,&#160;<br/>you take the&#160;other half and&#160;cover the Brooklyn Bridge. And no<i>&#160;</i>stopping for looting or&#160;pillaging!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Awwww!&#34;<i>&#160;</i>the whole Hermes&#160;cabin complained.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Silena, take the Aphrodite&#160;crew to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh my&#160;gods,&#34; one&#160;of her&#160;sisters said. &#34;Fifth Avenue&#160;is&#160;<i>so</i>&#160;on our way!&#160;We could accessorize, and&#160;<br/>
monsters, like,&#160;<i>totally&#160;</i>hate the smell of Givenchy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No delays,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Well . . . the perfume thing, if&#160;you think it'll&#160;work.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Six Aphrodite girls kissed me on the cheek in excitement.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right, enough!&#34; I closed&#160;my&#160;eyes, trying to think of what I'd&#160;forgotten. &#34;The Holland Tunnel.&#160;<br/>
Jake, take the&#160;Hephaestus cabin there. Use Greek fire,&#160;set traps. Whatever you've&#160;got.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He grinned. &#34;Gladly.&#160;We've got a score to settle. For Beckendorf!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The whole cabin roared in&#160;approval.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The 59th&#160;Street Bridge,&#34; I said. &#34;Clarisse—&#34;&#160;<br/>
I faltered. Clarisse wasn't&#160;here. The whole Ares&#160;cabin, curse them, was sitting back at camp.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll take that,&#34; Annabeth stepped in, saving me&#160;from&#160;an embarrassing silence. She turned to&#160;her&#160;<br/>
siblings. &#34;Malcolm, take the Athena cabin, activate&#160;plan twenty-three along the way,&#160;just like I showed&#160;<br/>you. Hold&#160;that&#160;position.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You got&#160;it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll go with Percy,&#34; she said. &#34;Then we'll join&#160;you,&#160;or&#160;we'll go wherever we're needed.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Somebody&#160;in&#160;the back of the group said,&#160;&#34;No detours,&#160;you two.&#34;&#160;<br/>
There were&#160;some giggles, but I decided&#160;to let it pass.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Keep in touch with&#160;cell phones.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=86></a>&#34;We don't have cell phones,&#34; Silena protested.&#160;<br/>
I reached down, picked up some snoring lady's&#160;BlackBerry, and tossed it to Silena. &#34;You do now.&#160;<br/>
You all know Annabeth's number, right? If you need us, pick up&#160;a&#160;random&#160;phone and call us.&#160;Use it once,&#160;<br/>drop it, then&#160;borrow another one if&#160;you&#160;have to. That&#160;should make it harder for the monsters to zero in on&#160;<br/>you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Everyone grinned as though&#160;they&#160;liked this idea.&#160;<br/>
Travis cleared&#160;his throat.&#160;&#34;Uh, if<i>&#160;</i>we find a really&#160;nice phone—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#160;you can't keep it,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Aw, man.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hold it, Percy,&#34; Jake Mason said. &#34;You&#160;forgot the Lincoln Tunnel.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I bit back a curse. He was&#160;right. A Sherman tank and a hundred<i>&#160;</i>monsters were marching through that&#160;<br/>
tunnel right now, and I'd positioned our&#160;forces everywhere else.&#160;<br/>
Then a girl's&#160;voice called from&#160;across the street: &#34;How&#160;about&#160;you leave that to us?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I'd never been happier to&#160;hear<i>&#160;&#160;</i>anyone&#160;in my&#160;life<i>.&#160;&#160;</i>A<i>&#160;&#160;</i>band of thirty&#160;adolescent girls crossed Fifth&#160;<br/>
Avenue. They&#160;wore white shirts, silvery&#160;camouflage&#160;pants, and combat boots. They&#160;all had swords at&#160;<br/>their sides, quivers on their backs, and bows at the ready.&#160;A pack of white timber wolves&#160;milled around&#160;<br/>their feet, and many&#160;of&#160;the&#160;girls had hunting falcons on&#160;their arms.&#160;<br/>
The girl in the lead had spiky&#160;black hair and a black leather jacket. She wore a silver circlet&#160;on her&#160;<br/>
head like a princess's tiara,&#160;which didn't match her&#160;skull earrings or her&#160;<i>Death to Barbie&#160;</i>T-shirt showing a&#160;<br/>little Barbie doll with an arrow through its head.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thalia!&#34; Annabeth cried.&#160;<br/>
The daughter&#160;of Zeus grinned. &#34;The Hunters of Artemis, reporting for duty.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
There were hugs and&#160;greetings all around&#160;. .&#160;.&#160;or at&#160;least Thalia was friendly.&#160;The&#160;other Hunters didn't like&#160;<br/>being around&#160;campers, especially&#160;boys, but they&#160;didn't&#160;shoot any&#160;of&#160;us, which for&#160;them&#160;was a pretty&#160;warm&#160;<br/>welcome.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Where have you&#160;been the last year?&#34; I asked Thalia. &#34;You've got like twice as&#160;many&#160;Hunters now!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She laughed.&#160;&#34;Long,&#160;<i>long&#160;</i>story.&#160;I bet my&#160;adventures were&#160;more dangerous than&#160;yours, Jackson.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Complete lie,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll&#160;see,&#34; she promised.&#160;&#34;After this is&#160;over, you,&#160;Annabeth, and me:&#160;cheeseburgers and fries at that&#160;<br/>
hotel on West&#160;57th.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Le Parker Meridien,&#34; I said. &#34;You're on. And Thalia,&#160;thanks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She shrugged.&#160;&#34;Those monsters won't know what hit them. Hunters, move out!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She slapped her silver bracelet,&#160;and the shield Aegis spiraled into full form. The golden head of&#160;<br/>
Medusa&#160;molded in the center was so&#160;horrible, the campers all backed away. The Hunters took off&#160;down&#160;<br/>the avenue, followed by&#160;their wolves and falcons, and&#160;I had a feeling the Lincoln Tunnel would be safe&#160;<br/>for now.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=87></a>&#34;Thank the gods,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;But if&#160;we don't&#160;blockade the rivers from&#160;those boats, guarding the&#160;<br/>
bridges and tunnels will be pointless.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're right,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
I looked at the campers, all of them&#160;grim and determined. I tried not to feel like this was the&#160;last time&#160;<br/>
I'd ever see them&#160;all together.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're the greatest&#160;heroes of this&#160;millennium,&#34; I&#160;told&#160;them.&#160;&#34;It&#160;doesn't&#160;matter how many&#160;monsters&#160;<br/>
come&#160;at you.&#160;Fight bravely, and we will win.&#34; I raised Riptide and shouted,&#160;&#34;FOR OLYMPUS!&#34;&#160;<br/>
They shouted in response,&#160;and our&#160;forty&#160;voices echoed off the buildings of&#160;Midtown. For a moment it&#160;<br/>
sounded brave, but it&#160;died&#160;quickly&#160;in&#160;the&#160;silence of ten million sleeping New Yorkers.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and I would've had our&#160;pick&#160;of cars, but&#160;they were all wedged in&#160;bumper-to-bumper traffic.&#160;<br/>None of the&#160;engines were running,&#160;which was weird.&#160;It seemed the drivers had had time to turn&#160;off the&#160;<br/>ignition before&#160;they&#160;got too sleepy.&#160;Or maybe Morpheus had the power to put engines to sleep as well.&#160;<br/>Most of the drivers had apparently&#160;tried to pull to&#160;the&#160;curb when they&#160;felt themselves passing&#160;out, but still&#160;<br/>the streets were too clogged to navigate.&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;we found an unconscious courier leaning against a brick&#160;wall, still straddling his red Vespa.&#160;<br/>
We dragged him&#160;off the scooter and laid&#160;him&#160;on the sidewalk.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sorry, dude,&#34;&#160;I said. With&#160;any&#160;luck, I'd be able to bring his scooter back. If I didn't, it would hardly&#160;<br/>
matter, because the city&#160;would be destroyed.&#160;<br/>
I drove with Annabeth behind me&#160;holding on to&#160;my&#160;waist. We zigzagged down Broadway&#160;with our&#160;<br/>
engine buzzing through the eerie&#160;calm.&#160;The only&#160;sounds were occasional cell phones ringing—like they&#160;<br/>were calling out to each other, as if New York&#160;had turned into a giant electronic aviary.&#160;<br/>
Our progress was slow. Every&#160;so often&#160;we'd come&#160;across pedestrians who'd fallen asleep right in front&#160;<br/>
of a car, and&#160;we'd<i>&#160;</i>move them&#160;just to be safe. Once&#160;we&#160;stopped to extinguish&#160;a pretzel vendor's&#160;cart that&#160;<br/>had caught on fire. A few&#160;minutes later&#160;we had to rescue a baby&#160;carriage that was rolling aimlessly&#160;down&#160;<br/>the street. It turned out there was no baby&#160;in&#160;it—just somebody's sleeping poodle. Go figure. We parked&#160;it&#160;<br/>safely&#160;in a doorway&#160;and&#160;kept riding.&#160;<br/>
We were passing Madison&#160;Square Park&#160;when Annabeth said, &#34;Pull&#160;over.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stopped in&#160;the middle of East 23rd.&#160;Annabeth jumped off and&#160;ran toward the park. By&#160;the time I&#160;<br/>
caught up with her, she was staring at&#160;a bronze statue&#160;on a red marble pedestal. I'd probably&#160;passed it&#160;a&#160;<br/>million<i>&#160;</i>times but never really looked at it.&#160;<br/>
The dude was sitting in a&#160;chair with his legs crossed. He wore an old-fashioned suit—Abraham&#160;<br/>
Lincoln style—with a bow tie and long&#160;coattails and&#160;stuff. A bunch of bronze books were piled under his&#160;<br/>chair. He held&#160;a writing quill in one hand and&#160;a big metal sheet of parchment in the other.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why&#160;do we care about . .&#160;.&#34; I squinted at the name on the pedestal. &#34;William&#160;H. Steward?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Seward,&#34; Annabeth corrected. &#34;He was a New&#160;York governor. Minor demigod—son of&#160;Hebe,&#160;I&#160;<br/>
think. But that's&#160;not important. It's&#160;the statue I care about.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=88></a>She climbed on a park bench and examined the base of the statue.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't tell&#160;me he's an automaton,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth smiled. &#34;Turns&#160;out most of the statues in&#160;the city are automatons. Daedalus planted them&#160;<br/>
here just in case he needed an army.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;To attack Olympus or defend it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth shrugged.&#160;&#34;Either one. That&#160;was plan twenty-three. He could activate one statue and it&#160;<br/>
would start activating its brethren all over the city,&#160;until there was an army. It's dangerous, though. You&#160;<br/>know how&#160;unpredictable automatons are.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Uh-huh,&#34; I said. We'd&#160;had our share of&#160;bad experiences with them. &#34;You're&#160;seriously&#160;thinking about&#160;<br/>
activating it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I have Daedalus's notes,&#34; she said. &#34;I think I can . .&#160;.&#160;Ah, here we&#160;go.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She pressed the tip of Seward's&#160;boot, and the statue stood&#160;up, its quill and paper ready.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's he going to&#160;do?&#34; I&#160;muttered. &#34;Take a&#160;memo?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Shh,&#34; Annabeth. &#34;Hello,&#160;William.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bill,&#34; I suggested.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bill . . . Oh, shut&#160;up,&#34; Annabeth told&#160;me. The statue tilted its head, looking at us with&#160;blank metal&#160;<br/>
eyes.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth cleared her throat. &#34;Hello, er, Governor Seward. Command sequence: Daedalus&#160;Twenty-<br/>
three. Defend&#160;Manhattan.&#160;Begin Activation.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Seward jumped off his pedestal. He hit the ground&#160;so&#160;hard his shoes cracked the sidewalk. Then he&#160;<br/>
went clanking off toward the east.&#160;<br/>
&#34;He's probably going to wake up&#160;Confucius,&#34; Annabeth guessed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Another statue, on Division. The point is, they'll keep waking each other up until they're all&#160;<br/>
activated.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And then?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hopefully,&#160;they&#160;defend Manhattan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Do they&#160;know that we're&#160;not the enemy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I think so.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's reassuring.&#34; I thought about all&#160;the bronze statues in the parks, plazas,&#160;and buildings&#160;of New&#160;<br/>
York. There had to be&#160;hundreds, maybe&#160;thousands.&#160;<br/>
Then a ball of&#160;green light exploded&#160;in the evening&#160;sky. Greek fire, somewhere over the East River.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to&#160;hurry,&#34; I&#160;said. And we ran for the Vespa.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
We parked outside Battery&#160;Park, at the lower tip&#160;of&#160;Manhattan where the Hudson and East&#160;Rivers came&#160;<br/>together and&#160;emptied into the bay.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=89></a>&#34;Wait here,&#34; I told Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#160;you shouldn't&#160;go alone.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, unless&#160;you can breathe underwater . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
She sighed. &#34;You are&#160;<i>so</i>&#160;annoying sometimes.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like when I'm&#160;right? Trust me, I'll be fine. I've got&#160;the curse of Achilles now. I'll all invincible&#160;and&#160;<br/>
stuff.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth didn't&#160;look convinced. &#34;Just be careful.&#160;I&#160;don't want anything to&#160;happen to&#160;you. I&#160;mean,&#160;<br/>
because we need you for the battle.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I grinned.&#160;&#34;Back in a flash.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I clambered down the shoreline&#160;and waded into the water.&#160;<br/>
Just for you non-sea-god types out there, don't go swimming&#160;m&#160;New&#160;York Harbor. It&#160;may&#160;not be as&#160;<br/>
filthy&#160;as it&#160;was in&#160;my&#160;mom's day,&#160;but that water will still probably&#160;make you&#160;grow a third&#160;eye or have&#160;<br/>mutant children when&#160;you&#160;grow up.&#160;<br/>
I dove into the murk and sank to the&#160;bottom.&#160;I tried to find&#160;the spot where the two rivers'&#160;currents&#160;<br/>
seemed equal—where they&#160;met to form&#160;the bay. I figured that was the best place&#160;to get their attention.&#160;<br/>
&#34;HEY!&#34; I shouted in my&#160;best underwater voice<i>.&#160;</i>The sound echoed&#160;in the darkness. &#34;I heard you guys&#160;<br/>
are so polluted&#160;you're embarrassed to&#160;show your faces. Is that true?&#34;&#160;<br/>
A cold current rippled through the bay,&#160;churning up&#160;plumes of garbage and silt.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I heard the&#160;East River is&#160;more toxic,&#34;&#160;I continued,&#160;&#34;but the Hudson smells worse. Or is it the other&#160;<br/>
way&#160;around?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The water shimmered. Something powerful and&#160;angry&#160;was watching me&#160;now. I could&#160;sense its&#160;<br/>
presence . . . or maybe&#160;<i>two&#160;</i>presences.&#160;<br/>
I was&#160;afraid&#160;I'd&#160;miscalculated with the insults. What if they just blasted&#160;me&#160;without showing&#160;<br/>
themselves? But these were&#160;New&#160;York river gods. I figured their instinct would&#160;be to get in my&#160;face.&#160;<br/>
Sure enough,&#160;two giant forms appeared&#160;in front&#160;of me. At first they were just dark brown columns of&#160;<br/>
silt, denser than the water around&#160;them.&#160;Then they&#160;grew&#160;legs, arms, and scowling&#160;faces.&#160;<br/>
The creature on the left looked disturbingly like a telkhine. His face&#160;was wolfish. His body&#160;was&#160;<br/>
vaguely&#160;like&#160;a seal's—sleek&#160;black with flipper hands&#160;and feet. His eyes glowed radiation green.&#160;<br/>
The dude on the right was&#160;more humanoid. He was&#160;dressed in rags and seaweed, with a chain-mail&#160;<br/>
coat&#160;made of&#160;bottle caps and old plastic six-pack holders. His face was blotchy&#160;with algae,&#160;and his beard&#160;<br/>was overgrown. His deep blue eyes burned with anger.&#160;<br/>
The seal, who had to be the god of the&#160;East River, said, &#34;Are you&#160;<i>trying&#160;</i>to get yourself killed, kid? Or&#160;<br/>
are you just extra stupid?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The bearded spirit of the Hudson scoffed.&#160;&#34;You're the expert on stupid, East.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Watch it, Hudson,&#34; East growled. &#34;Stay on&#160;your&#160;side&#160;of the island&#160;and mind your business.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Or what? You'll throw another garbage barge at&#160;me?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=90></a>They&#160;floated&#160;toward each&#160;other, ready&#160;to fight.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hold it!&#34; I&#160;yelled. &#34;We've got a bigger&#160;problem.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The kid's right,&#34; East snarled. &#34;Let's&#160;both kill&#160;<i>him,&#160;</i>then&#160;we'll fight each other.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sounds good,&#34; Hudson&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
Before I could protest, a thousand scraps of garbage&#160;surged off the bottom&#160;and flew straight at me&#160;<br/>
from&#160;both directions: broken glass, rocks, cans, tires.&#160;<br/>
I was expecting it,&#160;though.&#160;The water in&#160;front&#160;of me&#160;thickened into&#160;a shield. The debris bounced off&#160;<br/>
harmlessly.&#160;Only one piece got through—a big chunk of&#160;glass that hit my&#160;chest and probably should've&#160;<br/>killed me, but it shattered against my&#160;skin.&#160;<br/>
The two river gods stared at me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Son of Poseidon?&#34;&#160;East asked.&#160;<br/>
I nodded.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Took a dip in&#160;the Styx?&#34;&#160;Hudson asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yep.&#34;&#160;<br/>
They&#160;both made disgusted&#160;sounds.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, that's&#160;perfect,&#34; East&#160;said. &#34;<i>Now&#160;</i>how do we kill&#160;him?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We could electrocute him,&#34; Hudson mused. &#34;If&#160;I could just find some jumper cables—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Listen to me!&#34; I said. &#34;Kronos's&#160;army&#160;is invading Manhattan.'&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't you think we know&#160;that?&#34; East asked. &#34;I can&#160;feel his boats right now. They're almost across.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yep,&#34; Hudson agreed. &#34;I&#160;got some&#160;filthy monsters&#160;crossing my&#160;waters too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So stop them,&#34; I said. &#34;Drown them. Sink their boats.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why&#160;should&#160;we?&#34; Hudson&#160;grumbled. &#34;So they&#160;invade Olympus. What do we care?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Because I can pay&#160;you.&#34; I&#160;took&#160;out the sand dollar my&#160;father had given me&#160;for&#160;my birthday.&#160;<br/>
The river gods'&#160;eyes widened.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's&#160;mine!&#34; East said. &#34;Give it here, kid,&#160;and I promise none of Kronos's&#160;scum&#160;are getting across the&#160;<br/>
East River.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Forget that,&#34; Hudson said. &#34;That&#160;sand dollar's&#160;mine, unless you&#160;want&#160;me&#160;to let all those ships cross&#160;<br/>
the Hudson.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll compromise.&#34; I broke the sand dollar in half.&#160;A ripple of clean fresh water spread out from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
break, as if all the pollution in the&#160;bay&#160;were being dissolved.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You each get half,&#34; I said. &#34;In exchange,&#160;you keep all of Kronos's&#160;forces away&#160;from&#160;Manhattan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, man,&#34; Hudson whimpered, reaching out for the sand dollar. &#34;It's been so long since I was&#160;clean.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The power&#160;of Poseidon,&#34;&#160;East River murmured.&#160;&#34;He's a jerk, but&#160;he sure knows how to sweep&#160;<br/>
pollution away.&#34;&#160;<br/>
They&#160;looked&#160;at each other, then spoke as&#160;one: &#34;It's a&#160;deal.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I gave them&#160;each a sand-dollar half, which they&#160;held reverently.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=91></a>&#34;Um,&#160;the invaders?&#34; I prompted.&#160;<br/>
East flicked his hand. &#34;They just got sunk.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hudson snapped his fingers. &#34;Bunch of&#160;hellhounds just took a dive.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thank&#160;you,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Stay&#160;clean.&#34;&#160;<br/>
As I rose&#160;toward the surface, East called out, &#34;Hey, kid, any&#160;time you got a sand dollar to spend,&#160;<br/>
come&#160;on back. Assuming you live.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Curse of Achilles,&#34; Hudson snorted.&#160;&#34;They&#160;always&#160;think that'll save them, don't they?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;If only&#160;he knew,&#34; East agreed. They&#160;both laughed,&#160;dissolving into the water.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Back on the shore, Annabeth was talking on her cell&#160;phone, but she hung up as soon as she&#160;saw&#160;me. She&#160;<br/>looked pretty&#160;shaken.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It worked,&#34; I&#160;told her.&#160;&#34;The rivers are safe.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good,&#34; she&#160;said. &#34;Because we've got&#160;other problems. Michael&#160;Yew just called. Another&#160;army&#160;is&#160;<br/>
marching over the Williamsburg Bridge. The Apollo cabin needs&#160;help. And Percy,&#160;the monster leading&#160;<br/>the enemy&#160;. .&#160;. it's the Minotaur.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
ELEVEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
WE &#160;BREAK &#160;A &#160;BRIDGE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Fortunately,&#160;Blackjack was on duty.&#160;<br/>
I did my&#160;best taxicab whistle, and within&#160;a few&#160;minutes two dark shapes circled out&#160;of the sky.&#160;They&#160;<br/>
looked like hawks at first,&#160;but as they&#160;descended I&#160;could make out the long&#160;galloping legs of&#160;pegasi.&#160;<br/>
<i>Yo, boss.&#160;</i>Blackjack landed at a trot, his friend Porkpie right behind him.&#160;<i>Man, I thought those wind&#160;</i><br/>
<i>gods were gonna knock us&#160;to Pennsylvania until we said we were&#160;with you!</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks for coming,&#34; I told&#160;him.&#160;&#34;Hey,&#160;why&#160;do&#160;pegasi gallop as they&#160;fly,&#160;anyway?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Blackjack whinnied.&#160;<i>Why do humans swing their&#160;arms as they walk? I dunno,&#160;boss. It just feels right.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Where to?</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;We need to&#160;get to the Williamsburg Bridge,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Blackjack lowered his neck.&#160;<i>You're darn right,&#160;boss.&#160;We&#160;flew</i>&#160;<i>over</i>&#160;<i>it on the way here, and it don't look&#160;</i><br/>
<i>good. Hop</i>&#160;<i>on!&#160;</i><br/>
&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=92></a>On the way&#160;to the bridge, a knot formed in the pit&#160;of&#160;my&#160;stomach. The Minotaur was one of the first&#160;<br/>monsters I'd&#160;ever<i>&#160;</i>defeated. Four years ago he'd&#160;nearly&#160;killed&#160;my&#160;mother on Half-Blood Hill. I still had&#160;<br/>nightmares about that.&#160;<br/>
I'd been hoping he would&#160;stay&#160;dead for&#160;a few centuries, but I should've known&#160;my&#160;luck wouldn't hold.&#160;<br/>
We saw the&#160;battle before we were close enough to&#160;make out individual fighters. It was well after&#160;<br/>
midnight now, but the bridge blazed with light.&#160;Cars were burning. Arcs&#160;of fire streamed in both&#160;<br/>directions as flaming arrows and spears sailed through the air.&#160;<br/>
We came in for a low pass, and I saw the Apollo campers retreating. They would&#160;hide behind cars and&#160;<br/>
snipe at the approaching army, setting&#160;off explosive arrows and&#160;dropping caltrops in the road, building&#160;<br/>fiery&#160;barricades wherever they could, dragging sleeping&#160;drivers out of their cars to&#160;get them&#160;out&#160;of harm's&#160;<br/>way.&#160;But the enemy&#160;kept advancing. An entire phalanx of&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;</i>marched in the lead,&#160;their shields&#160;<br/>locked together, spear tips bristling over the top.&#160;An occasional arrow would connect with their snaky&#160;<br/>trunks, or&#160;a neck, or a chink in their armor, and the unlucky&#160;snake&#160;woman would disintegrate, but most of&#160;<br/>the Apollo&#160;arrows glanced harmlessly&#160;off their&#160;shield wall. About a&#160;hundred more&#160;monsters&#160;marched&#160;<br/>behind them.&#160;<br/>
Hellhounds leaped ahead&#160;of the line&#160;from time&#160;to time. Most were&#160;destroyed with&#160;arrows, but one got&#160;<br/>
hold of an Apollo camper&#160;and dragged&#160;him&#160;away. I didn't see what happened to him&#160;next. I didn't want to&#160;<br/>know.&#160;<br/>
&#34;There!&#34; Annabeth called from&#160;the back&#160;of her pegasus.&#160;<br/>
Sure enough,&#160;in the middle of the invading&#160;legion was&#160;Old Beefhead&#160;himself.&#160;<br/>
The last time I'd seen the Minotaur,&#160;he'd been wearing nothing&#160;but his tighty&#160;whities. I don't know&#160;<br/>
why.&#160;Maybe&#160;he'd&#160;been shaken out&#160;of bed to&#160;chase me. This time, he&#160;was prepared for battle.&#160;<br/>
From&#160;the waist down, he&#160;wore standard Greek battle&#160;gear—a kiltlike apron of&#160;leather and&#160;metal flaps,&#160;<br/>
bronze greaves covering his legs, and tightly&#160;wrapped leather sandals. His top&#160;was all bull—hair and hide&#160;<br/>and muscle leading to a head so large&#160;he should've&#160;toppled over just from&#160;the weight of his horns. He&#160;<br/>seemed larger<i>&#160;</i>than the last time&#160;I'd seen&#160;him—ten feet tall at least. A double-bladed axe was strapped to&#160;<br/>his back, but he was too impatient to use it. As soon as he&#160;saw&#160;me circling overhead (or sniffed&#160;me,&#160;more&#160;<br/>likely,&#160;since his eyesight was bad), he bellowed and picked up a white limousine.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blackjack, dive!&#34; I&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
<i>What?&#160;</i>The<i>&#160;</i>pegasus asked.&#160;<i>No way could he . . . Holy horse feed!</i>&#160;<br/>
We were&#160;at least a hundred feet up, but&#160;the limo came sailing toward us, flipping fender over fender&#160;<br/>
like a two-ton boomerang. Annabeth and Porkpie swerved&#160;madly&#160;to&#160;the left,&#160;while Blackjack tucked in his&#160;<br/>wings<i>&#160;&#160;</i>and plunged.&#160;The limo sailed&#160;over my&#160;head,&#160;missing by&#160;maybe two inches. It cleared the&#160;<br/>suspension lines of the bridge and fell toward the East River.&#160;<br/>
Monsters jeered and shouted, and the Minotaur picked&#160;up another car.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=93></a>&#34;Drop us behind the lines&#160;with the Apollo cabin,&#34; I&#160;told Blackjack. &#34;Stay&#160;in earshot but get out of&#160;<br/>
danger!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>I ain't gonna&#160;argue, boss!</i>&#160;<br/>
Blackjack swooped down&#160;behind an&#160;overturned school&#160;bus, where a couple of&#160;campers were hiding.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and I leaped&#160;off as soon as&#160;our pegasi's&#160;hooves touched the pavement. Then&#160;Blackjack&#160;and&#160;<br/>Porkpie soared into&#160;the night sky.&#160;<br/>
Michael Yew ran up&#160;to&#160;us.&#160;He was definitely&#160;the&#160;shortest commando I'd ever seen. He had a&#160;bandaged&#160;<br/>
cut on his arm.&#160;His&#160;ferrety&#160;face was smeared with&#160;soot and his quiver was almost empty,&#160;but he was&#160;<br/>smiling like he&#160;was having a great time.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Glad you could join&#160;us,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;Where are the other reinforcements?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;For now, we're it,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then we're dead,&#34; he said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You still have your flying&#160;chariot?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nah,&#34; Michael said. &#34;Left it at camp.&#160;I told Clarisse she could have it. Whatever,&#160;you&#160;know?&#160;Not&#160;<br/>
worth fighting about anymore. But she said it was too late. We'd&#160;insulted&#160;her honor for the last time&#160;or&#160;<br/>some&#160;stupid thing.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Least you tried,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Michael shrugged. &#34;Yeah,&#160;well, I called her some&#160;names&#160;when she said she still wouldn't fight. I&#160;<br/>
doubt&#160;that helped. Here come the uglies!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He drew an&#160;arrow and launched&#160;it toward the enemy.&#160;The arrow&#160;made&#160;a screaming sound as it flew.&#160;<br/>
When it landed, it unleashed a blast like&#160;a power chord&#160;on an electric guitar magnified through&#160;the world's&#160;<br/>largest speakers. The nearest cars exploded. Monsters dropped their weapons and clasped their ears in&#160;<br/>pain. Some&#160;ran. Others disintegrated on the spot.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That was&#160;my&#160;last sonic arrow,&#34; Michael said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;A gift from&#160;your dad?&#34; I&#160;asked. &#34;God&#160;of music?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Michael grinned wickedly. &#34;Loud music can be bad&#160;for&#160;you. Unfortunately, it doesn't&#160;always&#160;kill.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Sure enough,&#160;most&#160;monsters&#160;were regrouping, shaking&#160;off their confusion.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to fall back,&#34; Michael said.&#160;&#34;I've got&#160;Kayla and Austin setting traps farther&#160;down the&#160;<br/>
bridge.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; I said. &#34;Bring&#160;your&#160;campers forward to this position and&#160;wait for&#160;my&#160;signal. We're going to&#160;<br/>
drive the enemy&#160;back to Brooklyn.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Michael laughed. &#34;How do&#160;you&#160;plan to&#160;do&#160;that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I drew&#160;my&#160;sword.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=94></a>&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;let&#160;me&#160;come with&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Too dangerous,&#34; I said. &#34;Besides, I need you to&#160;help Michael&#160;coordinate the defensive line. I'll&#160;<br/>
distract the&#160;monsters.&#160;You group&#160;up here. Move the sleeping&#160;mortals out of the way.&#160;Then&#160;you can start&#160;<br/>picking&#160;off monsters while I keep them&#160;focused on me. If anybody&#160;can do all that,&#160;you can.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Michael snorted. &#34;Thanks a&#160;lot.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I kept my&#160;eyes on Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
She nodded reluctantly.&#160;&#34;All right. Get&#160;moving.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Before I could lose my&#160;courage, I said, &#34;Don't I get a kiss for luck? It's&#160;kind of a tradition, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I figured she would punch&#160;me. Instead, she drew her&#160;knife and stared&#160;at the&#160;army&#160;marching toward us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come back alive, Seaweed&#160;Brain. Then we'll see.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I figured it was the best offer I&#160;would get, so&#160;I stepped out from&#160;behind the school bus. I walked up&#160;<br/>
the bridge in&#160;plain sight, straight toward the enemy.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
When the Minotaur saw&#160;me, his eyes burned with&#160;hate. He bellowed—a sound that was somewhere&#160;<br/>between a yell, a moo, and a really&#160;loud&#160;belch.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, Beef Boy,&#34; I shouted&#160;back. &#34;Didn't I kill you already?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He pounded&#160;his fist into the hood&#160;of a Lexus, and it crumpled like&#160;aluminum&#160;foil.&#160;<br/>
A few&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;&#160;</i>threw flaming javelins at me. I knocked&#160;them aside. A hellhound lunged, and I&#160;<br/>
sidestepped. I could have stabbed it, but I&#160;hesitated.&#160;<br/>
<i>This is not Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;</i>I reminded myself.&#160;<i>This is&#160;an untamed&#160;monster. It will kill me and all&#160;my&#160;</i><br/>
<i>friends.</i>&#160;<br/>
It pounced again.<i>&#160;</i>This time I brought Riptide up in&#160;a&#160;deadly&#160;arc. The hellhound&#160;disintegrated into dust&#160;<br/>
and fur.&#160;<br/>
More monsters surged forward—snakes&#160;and giants&#160;and telkhines—but the Minotaur roared&#160;at them,&#160;<br/>
and they&#160;backed off&#160;<br/>
&#34;One on one?&#34; I called. &#34;Just like old times?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Minotaur's nostrils quivered. He seriously&#160;needed&#160;to keep a pack of Aloe&#160;Vera&#160;Kleenex&#160;in his&#160;<br/>
armor pocket, because that&#160;nose was wet<i>&#160;</i>and red and pretty&#160;gross. He unstrapped his axe and swung it&#160;<br/>around.&#160;<br/>
It was beautiful in a harsh&#160;<i>I’m~going~to-gut~you~like~a~fish&#160;</i>kind of way.&#160;Each of its twin&#160;blades&#160;<br/>
was shaped like an omega:&#160;Ω—the last letter of the Greek alphabet. Maybe that was because the axe&#160;<br/>would be the&#160;last thing his&#160;victims ever saw. The shaft was about the same height as the Minotaur, bronze&#160;<br/>wrapped in leather. Tied around the base&#160;of each blade&#160;were lots of bead necklaces. I realized they&#160;were&#160;<br/>Camp&#160;Half-Blood&#160;beads—necklaces taken from&#160;defeated demigods.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=95></a>I was&#160;so<i>&#160;</i>mad,&#160;I imagined my<i>&#160;</i>eyes glowing just like the Minotaur's. I raised&#160;my&#160;sword. The&#160;monster&#160;<br/>
army&#160;cheered&#160;for the Minotaur, but the&#160;sound died&#160;when I dodged his first swing and sliced his axe in&#160;<br/>half, right&#160;between the handholds.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Moo?&#34; he grunted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;HAAA!&#34;&#160;I spun and kicked him&#160;in the snout. He staggered backward, trying to&#160;regain his footing,&#160;<br/>
then lowered his head to charge.&#160;<br/>
He never&#160;got&#160;the chance.&#160;My&#160;sword flashed—slicing off&#160;one horn, then the other. He tried to&#160;grab&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
I rolled away, picking up half of his broken axe. The&#160;other&#160;monsters backed up in stunned silence,&#160;making&#160;<br/>a circle around us. The Minotaur bellowed in rage. He&#160;was never very smart to begin with,&#160;but now his&#160;<br/>anger&#160;made him&#160;reckless.&#160;He charged&#160;me,&#160;and I ran&#160;for the edge&#160;of the bridge, breaking through a line of&#160;<br/>
<i>dracaenae.</i>&#160;<br/>
The Minotaur&#160;must've smelled victory. He thought I&#160;was trying to&#160;get away. His&#160;minions cheered. At&#160;<br/>
the edge of the bridge, I turned and braced the axe&#160;against the railing to receive<i>&#160;</i>his charge. The Minotaur&#160;<br/>didn't even slow down.&#160;<br/>
<i>CRUNCH.</i>&#160;<br/>
He looked down in surprise&#160;at the axe handle sprouting from&#160;his breastplate.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks for playing,&#34; I told&#160;him.&#160;<br/>
I lifted him&#160;by&#160;his legs&#160;and tossed him&#160;over the&#160;side of the bridge. Even as he fell,&#160;he was&#160;<br/>
disintegrating, turning back into dust, his&#160;essence&#160;returning to Tartarus.&#160;<br/>
I turned toward his army. It was now roughly&#160;one&#160;hundred and ninety-nine to one. I did the natural&#160;<br/>
thing. I&#160;charged them.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
You're going to ask how the &#34;invincible&#34; thing worked: if I magically&#160;dodged&#160;every&#160;weapon, or if the&#160;<br/>weapons hit me and just didn't harm&#160;me. Honestly, I&#160;don't remember. All I knew was that I&#160;wasn't&#160;going&#160;<br/>to let these&#160;monsters invade&#160;my&#160;hometown.&#160;<br/>
I sliced through armor like it was&#160;made of paper.&#160;Snake women exploded.&#160;Hellhounds melted to&#160;<br/>
shadow. I slashed and stabbed and&#160;whirled, and I&#160;might have even laughed once or twice—a&#160;crazy&#160;laugh&#160;<br/>that scared&#160;me as&#160;much as it did my&#160;enemies. I was aware of the&#160;Apollo campers behind me&#160;shooting&#160;<br/>arrows, disrupting every&#160;attempt by&#160;the enemy&#160;to rally. Finally,&#160;the&#160;monsters turned and fled—about&#160;<br/>twenty&#160;left alive out of&#160;two&#160;hundred.&#160;<br/>
I followed with the Apollo&#160;campers at&#160;my heels.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes!&#34; yelled Michael Yew. &#34;That's what I'm talking about!&#34;&#160;<br/>
We drove them back toward&#160;the Brooklyn side of&#160;the bridge. The sky&#160;was growing pale m&#160;the east. I&#160;<br/>
could see the toll stations ahead.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=96></a>&#34;Percy!&#34;&#160;Annabeth yelled. &#34;You've&#160;already&#160;routed them. Pull back! We're overextended!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Some part of me knew she&#160;was right, but&#160;I was doing so&#160;well, I wanted to destroy&#160;every&#160;last monster.&#160;<br/>
Then I saw the crowd at the base of the&#160;bridge. The retreating&#160;monsters&#160;were running straight&#160;toward&#160;<br/>
their reinforcements. It was a small group, maybe thirty or forty&#160;demigods in&#160;battle armor, mounted on&#160;<br/>skeletal horses. One of them&#160;held a purple banner with the black scythe design.&#160;<br/>
The lead horseman trotted&#160;forward. He took off his helm, and I recognized Kronos himself,&#160;his eyes&#160;<br/>
like molten gold.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and the Apollo&#160;campers faltered. The monsters we'd<i>&#160;</i>been pursuing reached the Titan's line&#160;<br/>
and were&#160;absorbed into the new force.&#160;Kronos gazed in our direction. He was&#160;a quarter&#160;mile&#160;away, but I&#160;<br/>swear<i>&#160;</i>I could see him&#160;smile.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Now,&#34; I said, &#34;we pull back.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Titan lord's&#160;men drew their swords and charged. The hooves of their skeletal horses thundered&#160;<br/>
against the pavement. Our&#160;archers&#160;shot a volley,&#160;bringing down several of the enemy,&#160;but they&#160;just kept&#160;<br/>riding.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Retreat!&#34; I told my&#160;friends. &#34;I'll hold them.'&#34;&#160;<br/>
In a matter of seconds they were on&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
Michael and&#160;his archers tried to retreat,&#160;but Annabeth&#160;stayed right beside&#160;me, fighting with her knife&#160;<br/>
and mirrored&#160;shield as we slowly backed up the&#160;bridge.&#160;<br/>
Kronos's&#160;cavalry&#160;swirled around&#160;us, slashing and&#160;yelling insults. The Titan himself advanced&#160;<br/>
leisurely,&#160;like he had all the time&#160;in the world. Being&#160;the lord of&#160;time, I guess he did.&#160;<br/>
I tried to wound&#160;his men,&#160;not&#160;kill. That slowed&#160;me&#160;down,&#160;but these weren't&#160;monsters. They&#160;were&#160;<br/>
demigods who'd fallen under Kronos's&#160;spell. I couldn't&#160;see faces under l heir battle helmets,&#160;but some&#160;of&#160;<br/>them&#160;had probably&#160;been&#160;my&#160;friends. I slashed the&#160;legs off their horses and made the skeletal&#160;mounts&#160;<br/>disintegrate. After the first few demigods took a spill,&#160;the rest figured out they'd&#160;better dismount and fight&#160;<br/>me on foot.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and I stayed shoulder to shoulder, facing opposite directions. A dark shape passed over&#160;me,&#160;<br/>
and I dared to glance up. Blackjack&#160;and Porkpie were swooping&#160;in, kicking our enemies in&#160;the helmets&#160;<br/>and flying&#160;away&#160;like very&#160;large kamikaze pigeons.&#160;<br/>
We'd&#160;almost&#160;made it to the&#160;middle of the bridge&#160;when something strange happened. I felt a&#160;chill down&#160;<br/>
my&#160;spine—like that old saying about someone walking on&#160;your grave. Behind me, Annabeth cried out in&#160;<br/>pain.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth!&#34;&#160;I turned in time to see her&#160;fall, clutching her arm.&#160;A&#160;demigod with a bloody knife stood&#160;<br/>
over her.&#160;<br/>
In a flash I understood what had happened. He'd&#160;been trying to stab&#160;me.&#160;Judging from&#160;the position of&#160;<br/>
his blade, he&#160;would've taken me—maybe&#160;by sheer luck—in the small of my&#160;back, my&#160;only weak point.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=97></a>Annabeth had intercepted the knife with&#160;her own body.&#160;<br/>
<i>But why?&#160;</i>She&#160;didn't know&#160;about my&#160;weak spot. No one did.&#160;<br/>
I locked eyes&#160;with the enemy&#160;demigod. He wore&#160;an&#160;eye patch under his war helm: Ethan Nakamura,&#160;<br/>
the son of Nemesis. Somehow he'd survived the explosion on the&#160;<i>Princess Andromeda.&#160;</i>I slammed him in&#160;<br/>the face with&#160;my&#160;sword hilt so hard I dented his helm.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Get back!&#34; I slashed the air in a wide arc, driving&#160;the rest of the demigods away&#160;from&#160;Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No one touches her!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Interesting,&#34;&#160;Kronos said.&#160;<br/>
He towered above me&#160;on his skeletal horse, his&#160;scythe&#160;in&#160;one&#160;hand. He studied the scene with&#160;<br/>
narrowed eyes&#160;as if he could sense that I'd just come&#160;close to death, the way&#160;a wolf can smell fear.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bravely&#160;fought, Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;But&#160;it's time to surrender . . . or the girl dies.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, don't,&#34; Annabeth groaned. Her shirt was soaked with blood.&#160;I had to&#160;get&#160;her out of&#160;here.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blackjack!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>
As fast&#160;as light, the pegasus swooped down and clamped his teeth&#160;on the straps&#160;of Annabeth's&#160;armor.&#160;<br/>
They&#160;soared&#160;away&#160;over the river before the enemy&#160;could<i>&#160;</i>even react.&#160;<br/>
Kronos snarled. &#34;Some day soon,&#160;I am going&#160;to make&#160;pegasus soup. But in the meantime . . .&#34; He&#160;<br/>
dismounted,&#160;his scythe glistening in the dawn light.&#160;&#34;I'll settle for another dead demigod.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I&#160;met his first strike with Riptide. The impact&#160;shook the entire bridge, but I held&#160;my&#160;ground.&#160;Kronos's&#160;<br/>
smile wavered.&#160;<br/>
With a yell, I&#160;kicked his legs out from&#160;under him.&#160;His scythe skittered across the pavement. I stabbed&#160;<br/>
downward, but he rolled aside and regained his&#160;footing. His scythe&#160;flew back to his hands.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So . . .&#34; He&#160;studied me, looking&#160;mildly&#160;annoyed. &#34;You had the courage to visit the Styx.&#160;I had to&#160;<br/>
pressure Luke in many&#160;ways&#160;to convince&#160;him.&#160;If only&#160;<i>you&#160;</i>had supplied my&#160;host&#160;body instead&#160;. . . But no&#160;<br/>matter. I am still more powerful. I am&#160;a&#160;<i>TITAN.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
He struck the bridge with the butt&#160;of&#160;his&#160;scythe, and a&#160;wave of pure&#160;force blasted me backward. &#160;Cars&#160;<br/>
went careening. Demigods—even Luke's own&#160;men—were blown off the edge&#160;of the bridge. Suspension&#160;<br/>cords whipped around, and&#160;I skidded halfway&#160;back to&#160;Manhattan.&#160;<br/>
I got&#160;unsteadily to&#160;my&#160;feet. The remaining Apollo&#160;campers had almost&#160;made&#160;it to the end of the&#160;<br/>
bridge, except for Michael Yew, who&#160;was perched&#160;on one of the suspension&#160;cables&#160;a few&#160;yards away&#160;<br/>from&#160;me, His&#160;last arrow was notched in&#160;his bow.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Michael, go!&#34; I screamed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, the&#160;bridge!&#34; he called. &#34;It's already&#160;weak!&#34;&#160;<br/>
At first I didn't understand. Then&#160;I looked down and saw fissures in the pavement. Patches of the road&#160;<br/>
were half&#160;melted from&#160;Greek fire.&#160;The bridge had taken a beating from Kronos's&#160;blast and the exploding&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=98></a>arrows.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Break it!&#34; Michael yelled.&#160;&#34;Use your&#160;powers!&#34;&#160;<br/>
It was a desperate thought—no way it&#160;would work— but I stabbed Riptide into&#160;the bridge.&#160;The magic&#160;<br/>
blade sank to its hilt&#160;m&#160;asphalt. Salt water shot from&#160;the crack like&#160;I'd hit a geyser. I pulled out my&#160;blade&#160;<br/>and the fissure&#160;grew. The bridge shook and began to&#160;crumble. Chunks the size of&#160;houses fell into the East&#160;<br/>River. Kronos's demigods cried out in alarm&#160;and scrambled backward. Some&#160;were&#160;knocked off their feet.&#160;<br/>Within a few seconds, a fifty-foot chasm&#160;opened in&#160;the Williamsburg Bridge between Kronos and me.&#160;<br/>
The vibrations&#160;died.<i>&#160;</i>Kronos's&#160;men crept to the edge&#160;and looked at the hundred-and-thirty-foot drop&#160;<br/>
into the river.&#160;<br/>
I didn't feel safe, though.&#160;The suspension cables were still attached. The men could get&#160;across that&#160;<br/>
way&#160;if they&#160;were brave enough. Or maybe Kronos had&#160;a&#160;magic way&#160;to&#160;span the gap.&#160;<br/>
The Titan lord studied the&#160;problem. He looked behind him&#160;at the rising sun, then smiled across the&#160;<br/>
chasm.&#160;He raised his scythe&#160;in a mock&#160;salute. &#34;Until this evening, Jackson.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He&#160;mounted his horse, whirled around,&#160;and galloped&#160;back to Brooklyn, followed by&#160;his warriors.&#160;<br/>
I turned to thank Michael&#160;Yew, but the&#160;words died&#160;in&#160;my&#160;throat. Twenty&#160;feet away, a bow lay&#160;in the&#160;<br/>
street. Its owner was nowhere to be seen.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; I searched the wreckage on my&#160;side of the&#160;bridge. I stared down at the river. Nothing.&#160;<br/>
I yelled in anger and frustration. The sound carried&#160;forever in the&#160;morning stillness. I&#160;was about to&#160;<br/>
whistle for Blackjack to help&#160;me&#160;search, when&#160;my&#160;mom's phone rang. The LCD display&#160;said I had a call&#160;<br/>from&#160;Finklestein &amp; Associates—probably a demigod calling on a borrowed phone.&#160;<br/>
I picked up,&#160;hoping&#160;for good&#160;news. Of course I was wrong.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy?&#34; Silena Beauregard&#160;sounded like she'd been crying. &#34;Plaza&#160;Hotel. You'd better come&#160;quickly&#160;<br/>
and bring a healer from&#160;Apollo's&#160;cabin. It's&#160;. . . it's&#160;Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
TWELVE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
RACHEL &#160;MAKES &#160;A&#160;<br/>
BAD &#160;DEAL&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I grabbed Will Solace from the Apollo&#160;cabin and told the rest&#160;of<i>&#160;&#160;</i>his siblings to keep searching for&#160;<br/>Michael Yew.&#160;We borrowed a Yamaha&#160;FZI from&#160;a sleeping biker and drove to the Plaza&#160;Hotel at&#160;speeds&#160;<br/>that would've given my&#160;mom&#160;a heart attack. I'd never&#160;driven a motorcycle before, but it wasn't any&#160;harder&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=99></a>than riding a&#160;pegasus.&#160;<br/>
Along the way, I&#160;noticed a&#160;lot&#160;of empty&#160;pedestals that usually&#160;held&#160;statues. Plan twenty-three&#160;seemed&#160;<br/>
to be working.&#160;I didn't&#160;know if that was&#160;good&#160;or bad.&#160;<br/>
It only took&#160;us five minutes&#160;to reach the Plaza—an old-fashioned&#160;white stone hotel with a gabled blue&#160;<br/>
roof, sitting at the southeast corner of Central Park.&#160;<br/>
Tactically&#160;speaking, the Plaza&#160;wasn't&#160;the best place for a headquarters. It wasn't&#160;the tallest building in&#160;<br/>
town, or the&#160;most centrally located. But it had&#160;old-school style and had attracted a lot&#160;of famous demigods&#160;<br/>over the&#160;years, like the Beatles and Alfred Hitchcock, so I figured&#160;we were in good company.&#160;<br/>
I gunned&#160;the&#160;Yamaha over the curb and&#160;swerved to a stop at the fountain outside the hotel.&#160;<br/>
Will and I&#160;hopped&#160;off. The statue at the top of the fountain called down,&#160;&#34;Oh, fine.&#160;I suppose&#160;you&#160;<br/>
want&#160;me&#160;to watch your bike&#160;too!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She was&#160;a life-size&#160;bronze standing in the&#160;middle of a granite bowl. She wore&#160;only&#160;a bronze sheet&#160;<br/>
around her legs, and she was holding a&#160;basket of metal fruit. I'd never paid her too much attention&#160;before.&#160;<br/>Then again, she'd never talked to me&#160;before.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you supposed to be Demeter?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
A bronze apple sailed over my&#160;head.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Everyone thinks I'm Demeter.'&#34;&#160;she&#160;complained. &#34;I'm Pompona,&#160;the Roman&#160;Goddess of Plenty, but&#160;<br/>
why&#160;should&#160;<i>you&#160;&#160;</i>care? Nobody&#160;cares about the minor gods. If&#160;you cared about the minor gods,&#160;you&#160;<br/>wouldn't be losing this war! Three cheers for Morpheus and Hecate, I say!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Watch the bike,&#34; I told her.&#160;<br/>
Pompona cursed in Latin and threw more fruit as Will and I ran toward the hotel.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I'd never&#160;actually&#160;been inside the Plaza.<i>&#160;</i>The lobby&#160;was impressive, with the crystal chandeliers and the&#160;<br/>passed-out rich people, but I didn't pay&#160;much attention. A couple of Hunters&#160;gave us directions to the&#160;<br/>elevators, and we rode up to the penthouse suites.&#160;<br/>
Demigods had completely&#160;taken over the top floors.&#160;Campers and Hunters were crashed out&#160;on sofas,&#160;<br/>
washing up in&#160;the bathrooms, ripping silk draperies&#160;to bandage their wounds, and helping themselves to&#160;<br/>snacks and sodas from&#160;the&#160;minibars. A couple of timber&#160;wolves were drinking&#160;out&#160;of the toilets. I was&#160;<br/>relieved to see that so&#160;many&#160;of my&#160;friends had&#160;made&#160;it through the&#160;night alive, but everybody&#160;looked beat&#160;<br/>up.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; Jake Mason clapped me on the shoulder. &#34;We're getting reports—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Later,&#34; I said. &#34;Where's&#160;Annabeth?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The terrace.&#160;She's&#160;alive,&#160;man, but . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I pushed past&#160;him.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=100></a>Under different circumstances I&#160;would've loved the view from&#160;the terrace. It looked straight&#160;down&#160;<br/>
onto Central Park. The&#160;morning was clear and bright—perfect for a picnic or&#160;a hike, or&#160;pretty&#160;much&#160;<br/>anything&#160;except fighting monsters.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth lay on a lounge&#160;chair. Her face&#160;was pale&#160;and beaded&#160;with sweat.&#160;Even though she was&#160;<br/>
covered in blankets, she shivered. Silena Beauregard&#160;was wiping her forehead with a cool cloth.&#160;<br/>
Will and I pushed through a crowd&#160;of Athena kids. Will unwrapped&#160;Annabeth's bandages to examine&#160;<br/>
the wound,&#160;and I wanted to&#160;faint. The bleeding had stopped&#160;but the gash looked&#160;deep. The skin&#160;around the&#160;<br/>cut was a horrible shade of green.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth . .&#160;.&#34; I choked&#160;up. She'd taken that knife for me. How could I&#160;have let that happen?&#160;<br/>
&#34;Poison on&#160;the dagger,&#34; she&#160;mumbled. &#34;Pretty&#160;stupid&#160;of me, huh?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Will Solace&#160;exhaled with relief. &#34;It's not so bad,&#160;Annabeth. A few&#160;more&#160;minutes and we&#160;would've&#160;<br/>
been in trouble, but&#160;the venom&#160;hasn't&#160;gotten past&#160;the shoulder yet.&#160;Just lie still.&#160;Somebody&#160;hand me&#160;some&#160;<br/>nectar.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I grabbed a canteen. Will cleaned out the wound with&#160;the godly drink while I held&#160;Annabeth's&#160;hand.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ow,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>she said. &#34;Ow,<i>&#160;</i>ow!&#34;&#160;She gripped my&#160;fingers&#160;so tight&#160;they&#160;turned purple, but&#160;she stayed still,&#160;<br/>
like Will<i>&#160;</i>asked. Silena muttered words of encouragement.&#160;Will put some silver paste over the wound and&#160;<br/>hummed words in Ancient Greek—a hymn&#160;to Apollo. Then he applied fresh bandages and stood up&#160;<br/>shakily.&#160;<br/>
The healing&#160;must've taken a lot of his energy. He looked almost&#160;as&#160;pale as Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That should&#160;do it,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;But we're going to&#160;need some&#160;mortal supplies.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He grabbed a&#160;piece of hotel stationery, jotted down&#160;some notes, and handed it&#160;to one of the Athena&#160;<br/>
guys. &#34;There's a Duane Reade on Fifth.&#160;Normally&#160;I would&#160;never steal—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I would,&#34; Travis volunteered.&#160;<br/>
Will glared at him.&#160;&#34;Leave cash or drachmas to pay, whatever you've got, but&#160;this is an emergency.&#160;<br/>
I've got a feeling we're going to&#160;have a lot more people to treat.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nobody disagreed. There was hardly&#160;a&#160;single demigod who&#160;hadn't already&#160;been wounded .&#160;.&#160;. except&#160;<br/>
me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come on, guys,&#34;&#160;Travis Stoll said. &#34;Let's&#160;give Annabeth some&#160;space. We've got&#160;a drugstore to raid . .&#160;<br/>
. I mean, visit.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The demigods shuffled back inside. Jake Mason grabbed my&#160;shoulder as he was leaving. &#34;We'll talk&#160;<br/>
later, but it's&#160;under control.&#160;I'm using Annabeth's&#160;shield to keep an eye on things. The enemy&#160;withdrew at&#160;<br/>sunrise; not sure why. We've got a&#160;lookout at each bridge and tunnel.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks, man,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
He nodded. &#34;Just take your&#160;time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=101></a>He closed the terrace doors behind&#160;him,&#160;leaving Silena, Annabeth, and me&#160;alone.&#160;<br/>
Silena pressed a cool cloth to Annabeth's forehead. &#34;This is all&#160;my&#160;fault.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; Annabeth said weakly. &#34;Silena, how is it&#160;your&#160;fault?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I've never been any&#160;good&#160;at camp,&#34; she&#160;murmured. &#34;Not like&#160;you&#160;or Percy.&#160;If I&#160;was a better fighter . .&#160;<br/>
.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her&#160;mouth trembled. Ever since Beckendorf died she'd been getting worse, and every&#160;time I looked at&#160;<br/>
her, it&#160;made&#160;me angry&#160;about his death all over again. Her expression reminded&#160;me&#160;of glass—like she&#160;<br/>might break any&#160;minute. I&#160;swore to myself that if I ever found&#160;the spy&#160;who'd cost&#160;her boyfriend his life,&#160;I&#160;<br/>would give him&#160;to Mrs. O'Leary&#160;as a chew toy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're a great camper,&#34; I told Silena.&#160;&#34;You're the best pegasus rider we have. And&#160;you get along&#160;<br/>
with people.&#160;Believe&#160;me, anyone who&#160;can make friends with Clarisse has talent.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She stared at&#160;me&#160;like I'd&#160;just given her an idea.&#160;&#34;That's it! We&#160;need the Ares cabin. I can talk to&#160;<br/>
Clarisse. I&#160;<i>know&#160;</i>I can convince her to help us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Whoa, Silena. Even if you could get&#160;off the island, Clarisse&#160;is pretty&#160;stubborn. Once she gets&#160;<br/>
angry—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Please,&#34; Silena said. &#34;I can take a pegasus. I&#160;<i>know&#160;</i>I can&#160;make it back to camp. Let&#160;me&#160;try.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I exchanged looks with Annabeth. She nodded slightly.&#160;<br/>
I didn't like the idea. I didn't&#160;think Silena stood a chance of convincing Clarisse to fight. On the other&#160;<br/>
hand, Silena was&#160;so distracted right now that she&#160;would just get herself hurt&#160;in&#160;battle. Maybe sending her&#160;<br/>back to camp&#160;would give her something else to focus on.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right,&#34; I&#160;told her. &#34;I&#160;can't&#160;think of anybody better to&#160;try.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena threw her arms&#160;around me. Then she pushed&#160;back awkwardly,&#160;glancing&#160;at Annabeth. &#34;Um,&#160;<br/>
sorry.&#160;Thank&#160;you, Percy!&#160;I&#160;won't let you&#160;down!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Once she was gone, I&#160;knelt&#160;next to Annabeth and felt&#160;her forehead. She was still&#160;burning up.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're cute&#160;when you're worried,&#34; she muttered.&#160;&#34;Your eyebrows get all scrunched together.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You are&#160;<i>not&#160;</i>going&#160;to die<i>&#160;</i>while I owe you a favor,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Why&#160;did&#160;you take that knife?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You would've&#160;done the same for&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
It was true. I&#160;guess we both knew it. Still, I felt like somebody&#160;was poking my&#160;heart with a cold metal&#160;<br/>
rod. &#34;How did&#160;you know?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Know what?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked around to make sure we were&#160;alone. Then&#160;I leaned in close and whispered: &#34;My&#160;Achilles&#160;<br/>
spot. If&#160;you hadn't taken that knife, I would've died.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She got a faraway&#160;look in&#160;her eyes. Her breath smelled of grapes, maybe from the nectar. &#34;I don't&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=102></a>know, Percy.&#160;I just had this&#160;feeling&#160;you&#160;were&#160;in danger. Where . . . where is the spot?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wasn't&#160;supposed to tell anyone. But this&#160;was&#160;Annabeth. If I couldn't&#160;trust her, I couldn't trust anyone.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The small of my&#160;back.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She lifted her hand. &#34;Where? Here?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She put her hand on my&#160;spine, and my&#160;skin tingled.&#160;I moved her fingers to the one spot that grounded&#160;<br/>
me to&#160;my&#160;mortal life. A thousand volts of electricity&#160;seemed to arc through my&#160;body.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You saved me,&#34; I said. &#34;Thanks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She removed her hand, but&#160;I kept holding&#160;it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So&#160;you owe&#160;me,&#34; she said&#160;weakly. &#34;What else is new?&#34;&#160;<br/>
We watched the sun come up over the&#160;city.<i>&#160;</i>The traffic should've&#160;been heavy&#160;by&#160;now, but there were&#160;<br/>
no cars honking, no crowds bustling along the sidewalks.&#160;<br/>
Far away, I could&#160;hear a car alarm&#160;echo through&#160;the&#160;streets. A plume of black smoke curled&#160;into the&#160;<br/>
sky&#160;somewhere over Harlem. I&#160;wondered how&#160;many&#160;ovens&#160;had been left on when the Morpheus spell hit;&#160;<br/>how many&#160;people had fallen asleep in the middle of&#160;cooking dinner. Pretty&#160;soon there would be more&#160;<br/>fires. Everyone in New York was in&#160;danger—and all those lives depended on&#160;us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You asked me why&#160;Hermes&#160;was&#160;mad&#160;at&#160;me,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, you need&#160;to&#160;rest—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, I want to tell&#160;you.&#160;It's&#160;been bothering me&#160;for a long time.&#34; She&#160;moved her shoulder and&#160;winced.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Last year, Luke came&#160;to see&#160;me in San Francisco.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;In person?&#34;&#160;I felt like she'd just hit me&#160;with a hammer. &#34;He came&#160;to&#160;your house?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;This was before we&#160;went into the Labyrinth, before&#160;. . .&#34; She faltered, but I knew what&#160;she&#160;meant:&#160;<br/>
<i>before be turned into Kronos.&#160;</i>&#34;He<i>&#160;&#160;</i>came under a flag of truce. He said he only&#160;wanted five&#160;minutes to&#160;<br/>talk. He looked scared, Percy.&#160;He told me&#160;Kronos was going to use him&#160;to take&#160;over the world. He said he&#160;<br/>wanted to run away, like the old days. He&#160;wanted&#160;me&#160;to&#160;come&#160;with him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But&#160;you&#160;didn't&#160;trust him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Of<i>&#160;</i>course not. I thought it&#160;was a trick.&#160;Plus . . . well,&#160;a lot of things&#160;had changed since the old days. I&#160;<br/>
told Luke there was no way.&#160;He got&#160;mad. He said . . . he said&#160;I might as&#160;well fight him&#160;right there,&#160;<br/>because it was the last chance I'd get.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her forehead&#160;broke out in sweat again. The story was taking too much of her energy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's okay,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Try to&#160;get some rest.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You don't understand, Percy.&#160;Hermes&#160;was&#160;right. Maybe if I'd gone with&#160;him,&#160;I could've&#160;changed his&#160;<br/>
mind. Or—or I had a knife.&#160;Luke was unarmed. I could've—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Killed him?&#34; I said. &#34;You&#160;know that wouldn't have been right.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=103></a>She squeezed&#160;her eyes shut. &#34;Luke said Kronos would use him&#160;<i>like a stepping stone.&#160;</i>Those were his&#160;<br/>
exact words. Kronos would use Luke, and become&#160;even more powerful.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;He did that,&#34; I said. &#34;He possessed Luke's body.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But what if&#160;Luke's&#160;body is only a transition? What if Kronos&#160;has a plan to&#160;become even more&#160;<br/>
powerful? I could've stopped him.&#160;The&#160;war is&#160;my&#160;fault.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her story&#160;made&#160;me&#160;feel like I was&#160;back&#160;in the Styx, slowly&#160;dissolving. I remembered last&#160;summer,&#160;<br/>
when the two-headed god, Janus, had warned Annabeth she would have to make a&#160;major choice—and&#160;<br/>that had happened&#160;<i>after&#160;</i>she saw Luke. Pan had also said something to&#160;her:&#160;<i>You will play&#160;a great role,&#160;</i><br/>
<i>though it may&#160;not be the role you imagined.</i>&#160;<br/>
I wanted to<i>&#160;</i>ask her about the vision Hestia&#160;had shown&#160;me, about her early&#160;days&#160;with Luke and Thalia.&#160;<br/>
I knew it had&#160;something to&#160;do with my&#160;prophecy, but I&#160;didn't understand what.&#160;<br/>
Before I could get up&#160;my&#160;nerve, the terrace door opened. Connor&#160;Stoll stepped through.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy.&#34; He&#160;glanced at Annabeth like&#160;he didn't want to say&#160;anything bad&#160;in front of&#160;her, but I could&#160;<br/>
tell he wasn't&#160;bringing&#160;good&#160;news. &#34;Mrs. O'Leary&#160;just&#160;came&#160;back with Grover.&#160;I think&#160;you should&#160;talk to&#160;<br/>him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Grover was having a snack&#160;in the living room.&#160;He was&#160;dressed for battle in an&#160;armored&#160;shirt&#160;made from&#160;<br/>tree bark and twist ties, with his wooden&#160;cudgel and his reed pipes hanging&#160;from his belt.&#160;<br/>
The Demeter&#160;cabin had whipped&#160;up a&#160;whole buffet&#160;in the hotel&#160;kitchens—everything from&#160;pizza to&#160;<br/>
pineapple ice<i>&#160;</i>cream.&#160;Unfortunately, Grover was eating the furniture. He'd&#160;already&#160;chewed the stuffing off&#160;<br/>a fancy&#160;chair&#160;and was now gnawing the&#160;armrest.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dude,&#34; I said, &#34;we're only borrowing this place.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blah-ha-ha!&#34; He had stuffing all over his face. &#34;Sorry, Percy.&#160;It's just . . . Louis the&#160;Sixteenth&#160;<br/>
furniture.&#160;<i>Delicious.&#160;</i>Plus I&#160;always&#160;eat furniture when&#160;I get—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;When&#160;you get nervous,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Yeah, I know. So&#160;what's&#160;up?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He clopped on&#160;his hooves.&#160;&#34;I<i>&#160;</i>heard about Annabeth. Is&#160;she . . .?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;She's&#160;going to&#160;be fine. She's resting.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover took&#160;a deep breath. &#34;That's good. I've mobilized&#160;most of the nature spirits in the city—well,&#160;<br/>
the ones that will listen to&#160;me,&#160;anyway.&#34; He rubbed his forehead. &#34;I had no idea acorns could hurt so&#160;<br/>much. Anyway, we're helping out as much as we can.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He told&#160;me about the skirmishes&#160;they'd&#160;seen. Mostly&#160;they'd&#160;been covering uptown, where&#160;we didn't&#160;<br/>
have enough&#160;demigods. Hellhounds&#160;had appeared in all sorts of places,&#160;shadow-traveling inside our lines,&#160;<br/>and the&#160;dryads and satyrs had&#160;been fighting&#160;them&#160;off. A&#160;young&#160;dragon&#160;had appeared in Harlem, and a&#160;<br/>dozen wood&#160;nymphs died before the monster was finally defeated.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=104></a>As Grover talked, Thalia entered the room&#160;with&#160;two of her lieutenants. She nodded to me&#160;grimly,&#160;<br/>
went outside&#160;to check on&#160;Annabeth, and came&#160;back&#160;in. She listened while Grover completed his report—<br/>the details getting worse and worse.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We lost twenty&#160;satyrs against some&#160;giants at Fort Washington,&#34;&#160;he said, his voice trembling.&#160;&#34;Almost&#160;<br/>
half my&#160;kinsmen. River spirits drowned&#160;the giants in the end, but . .&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia shouldered her bow. &#34;Percy, Kronos's&#160;forces are still gathering at every&#160;bridge and tunnel. And&#160;<br/>
Kronos isn't the only&#160;Titan.&#160;One of&#160;my&#160;Hunters spotted a huge man in golden armor&#160;mustering an army&#160;on&#160;<br/>the Jersey&#160;shore. I'm&#160;not sure who he is, but&#160;he radiates power like only&#160;a Titan&#160;or&#160;god.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I remembered&#160;the golden&#160;Titan from&#160;my&#160;dream—the one on Mount&#160;Othrys&#160;who&#160;erupted into&#160;flames.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Great,&#34; I said. &#34;Any&#160;good news?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia shrugged. &#34;We've sealed off the subway&#160;tunnels&#160;into Manhattan. My&#160;best trappers took care of&#160;<br/>
it. Also, it&#160;seems&#160;like the enemy&#160;is waiting for tonight to&#160;attack. I&#160;think Luke&#34;—she caught herself—&#34;I&#160;<br/>mean Kronos needs time&#160;to regenerate&#160;after each fight. He's still&#160;not comfortable with his new form. It's&#160;<br/>taking a lot&#160;of&#160;his power to&#160;slow time&#160;around the city.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover nodded. &#34;Most of his forces are&#160;more powerful at night, too. But they'll be back after&#160;<br/>
sundown.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I tried to think clearly. &#34;Okay.&#160;Any&#160;word&#160;from&#160;the gods?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia shook her head. &#34;I know Lady&#160;Artemis would be here if she could. Athena, too. But Zeus has&#160;<br/>
ordered them to stay&#160;at his side. The last I heard,&#160;Typhon was&#160;destroying the Ohio River valley.&#160;He&#160;<br/>should reach&#160;the Appalachian Mountains&#160;by&#160;midday.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;So&#160;</i>at best,&#34; I said, &#34;we've&#160;got another two days&#160;before he arrives.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Jake Mason cleared his throat. He'd been&#160;standing there so silently I'd almost forgotten&#160;he&#160;was in the&#160;<br/>
room.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, something else,&#34; he said. &#34;The way&#160;Kronos&#160;showed up at&#160;the Williamsburg Bridge,&#160;like he&#160;<br/>
knew you were going there. And he shifted his forces&#160;to our weakest points. As soon as we deployed, he&#160;<br/>changed tactics. He barely touched the&#160;Lincoln Tunnel, where the&#160;Hunters were strong. He&#160;went for our&#160;<br/>weakest spots, like he knew.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like he had&#160;inside information,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;The spy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What spy?&#34;&#160;Thalia demanded.&#160;<br/>
I told her about the silver charm&#160;Kronos&#160;had shown me, the communication device.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's bad,&#34; she said. &#34;Very&#160;bad.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It could&#160;be anyone,&#34; Jake&#160;said. &#34;We were all&#160;standing there when Percy&#160;gave the orders.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But what can we do?&#34;&#160;Grover asked. &#34;Frisk&#160;every&#160;demigod until&#160;we find a scythe charm?&#34;&#160;<br/>
They&#160;all looked at&#160;me,&#160;waiting for a decision. I couldn't afford to show how panicked I felt,&#160;even if&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=105></a>things seemed hopeless.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We keep fighting,&#34; I said. &#34;We can't&#160;obsess about this spy<i>.&#160;</i>If we're suspicious of each other, we'll&#160;<br/>
just tear ourselves&#160;apart. You guys&#160;were awesome last night. I&#160;couldn't ask for a&#160;braver army. Let's set up&#160;<br/>a rotation for&#160;the watches.&#160;Rest up while&#160;you can. We've got a long&#160;night ahead of&#160;us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The demigods&#160;mumbled agreement. They&#160;went their&#160;separate ways&#160;to&#160;sleep or&#160;eat or repair their&#160;<br/>
weapons.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#160;you&#160;too,&#34; Thalia said. &#34;We'll keep an eye&#160;on&#160;things. Go&#160;lie down. We&#160;need you in&#160;good shape&#160;<br/>
for tonight.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't argue&#160;too&#160;hard. I&#160;found&#160;the nearest bedroom&#160;and crashed on&#160;the canopied bed.&#160;I thought I&#160;was&#160;<br/>
too wired to sleep, but my&#160;eyes closed almost immediately.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
In my<i>&#160;&#160;</i>dream, I saw Nico di<i>&#160;&#160;</i>Angelo&#160;alone in the gardens of Hades. He'd just dug a hole&#160;in one of&#160;<br/>Persephone's&#160;flower beds, which I didn't figure would&#160;make the queen very happy.&#160;<br/>
He poured a&#160;goblet&#160;of wine&#160;into the hole and began to&#160;chant. &#34;Let&#160;the dead taste again. Let them&#160;rise&#160;<br/>
and take this&#160;offering. Maria di Angelo,&#160;show yourself!&#34;&#160;<br/>
White smoke gathered. A&#160;human figure formed, but&#160;it wasn't&#160;Nico's&#160;mother. It&#160;was a&#160;girl with dark&#160;<br/>
hair, olive skin, and the silvery&#160;clothes of a Hunter.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bianca,&#34; Nico&#160;said. &#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Don't summon our mother,&#160;Nico,&#160;</i>she warned.&#160;<i>She is the one spirit&#160;you are forbidden to see.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why?&#34; he demanded. &#34;What's our father hiding?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Pain,&#160;</i>Bianca said.&#160;<i>Hatred. A curse that stretches back&#160;to the Great Prophecy.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;What do&#160;you&#160;mean?&#34; Nico said. &#34;I have&#160;to know!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>The knowledge will only hurt you. Remember what&#160;I&#160;said: holding grudges is a&#160;fatal flaw for children&#160;</i><br/>
<i>of Hades.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;I<i>&#160;</i>know that,&#34;&#160;Nico said. &#34;But I'm&#160;not the same as I used to be, Bianca. Stop trying&#160;to protect me!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Brother, you&#160;don't&#160;understand</i>—&#160;<br/>
Nico swiped his hand through the mist,&#160;and Bianca s&#160;image dissipated.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maria di Angelo,&#34; he said again. &#34;Speak to me!&#34;&#160;<br/>
A different image formed. It was a scene rather than a single ghost. In the&#160;mist, I saw Nico and&#160;<br/>
Bianca as little children,&#160;playing in&#160;the lobby of an&#160;elegant hotel, chasing each other around marble&#160;<br/>columns.&#160;<br/>
A woman sat&#160;on a nearby&#160;sofa. She wore a black dress, gloves, and a black veiled hat like a star from&#160;<br/>
an old 1940s&#160;movie. She had Bianca's&#160;smile and Nico's&#160;eyes.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=106></a>On a chair next to her sat a large oily&#160;man in a black pinstripe suit. With a shock, I realized it was&#160;<br/>
Hades. He&#160;was leaning toward the woman, using his hands as he talked, like he&#160;was agitated.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Please,&#160;my&#160;dear,&#34; he said. &#160; &#34;You&#160;<i>must&#160;</i>come to the Underworld. I&#160;don't care what Persephone thinks!&#160;<br/>
I can keep you safe there.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, my&#160;love.&#34; She spoke with an Italian accent.&#160;&#34;Raise our children in the land of the dead? I will&#160;<br/>
not do this.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maria, listen&#160;to me. The&#160;war in Europe has turned the other gods&#160;against&#160;me.&#160;A prophecy&#160;has been&#160;<br/>
made. My&#160;children are no&#160;longer safe. Poseidon and&#160;Zeus have forced&#160;me&#160;into an agreement. None of us&#160;<br/>are to have demigod children ever again.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But you&#160;already&#160;<i>have&#160;</i>Nico and Bianca. Surely—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No! The prophecy warns of a child who turns&#160;sixteen. Zeus has decreed that the children I currently&#160;<br/>
have&#160;must be turned over&#160;to Camp&#160;Half-Blood for&#160;<i>proper training,&#160;</i>but I know what he&#160;means. At best&#160;<br/>they'll be watched, imprisoned, turned against their father. Even more likely,&#160;he will not take a chance.&#160;He&#160;<br/>won't allow&#160;my&#160;demigod&#160;children to reach sixteen. He'll&#160;find a way&#160;to&#160;destroy&#160;them, and I won't risk that!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;<i>Certamente</i>,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>Maria said. &#34;We will stay together. Zeus is&#160;<i>un imbecile.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
I couldn't help admiring her courage, but Hades glanced nervously&#160;at the ceiling. &#34;Maria, please. I&#160;<br/>
told&#160;you,&#160;Zeus&#160;gave me&#160;a deadline of<i>&#160;last&#160;week&#160;</i>to&#160;turn&#160;over&#160;the&#160;children.&#160;His wrath will be horrible, and I&#160;<br/>cannot hide&#160;you forever. As&#160;long as&#160;you&#160;are&#160;with the children,&#160;you are in danger too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Maria smiled, and again it&#160;was creepy&#160;how much she looked like&#160;her daughter. &#34;You are a god, my&#160;<br/>
love. You will&#160;protect us.&#160;But I will not&#160;take Nico and Bianca to the Underworld.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades wrung&#160;his hands. &#34;Then, there is another option.&#160;I know a place in the desert where time stands&#160;<br/>
still. I could send the children there, just&#160;for a while,&#160;for their&#160;own safety, and we could be together. I will&#160;<br/>build&#160;you a&#160;golden palace by&#160;the Styx.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Maria di Angelo laughed&#160;gently. &#34;You&#160;are a kind&#160;man,&#160;my&#160;love. A generous&#160;man. The other gods&#160;<br/>
should see&#160;you as I do, and they&#160;would&#160;not fear&#160;you&#160;so. But Nico&#160;and Bianca need their mother. Besides,&#160;<br/>they are only&#160;children. The&#160;gods wouldn't really&#160;hurt them.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You don't know my&#160;family,&#34; Hades said darkly. &#34;Please, Maria, I&#160;can't&#160;lose you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She touched&#160;his lips with&#160;her fingers. &#34;You will not&#160;lose&#160;me. Wait&#160;for me&#160;while I get my&#160;purse. Watch&#160;<br/>
the children.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She kissed the lord of the dead&#160;and rose from&#160;the&#160;sofa. Hades&#160;watched her walk upstairs as&#160;if her&#160;<br/>
every&#160;step away&#160;caused him&#160;pain.&#160;<br/>
A&#160;moment later, he tensed. The children&#160;stopped playing as if they&#160;sensed something too.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; Hades said. But even his godly&#160;powers were&#160;too slow. He only&#160;had&#160;time to&#160;erect a wall&#160;of black&#160;<br/>
energy&#160;around&#160;the children&#160;before the hotel exploded.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=107></a>The force was so violent, the entire&#160;mist&#160;image dissolved.&#160;<br/>
When it came into focus again, I saw&#160;Hades kneeling in the ruins, holding&#160;the broken form&#160;of&#160;Maria&#160;<br/>
di Angelo. Fires still burned all around him.&#160;Lightning flashed across the sky, and thunder rumbled.&#160;<br/>
Little Nico and Bianca stared at their&#160;mother uncomprehendingly. The Fury&#160;Alecto appeared behind&#160;<br/>
them, hissing&#160;and flapping&#160;her leathery&#160;wings. The children didn't seem to notice her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Zeus!&#34; Hades shook his fist at the sky.&#160;&#34;I will crush you<i>&#160;</i>for&#160;this! I&#160;will<i>&#160;</i>bring her&#160;back!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;My lord,&#160;you cannot,&#34; Alecto warned. &#34;You of all immortals&#160;must respect the&#160;laws of death.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades glowed with rage. I thought he would show his true form&#160;and vaporize his own children, but at&#160;<br/>
the last&#160;moment he seemed to regain control.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Take them,&#34; he told Alecto, choking&#160;back a sob.&#160;&#34;Wash their&#160;memories clean&#160;m the&#160;Lethe and&#160;bring&#160;<br/>
them&#160;to the Lotus Hotel. Zeus will<i>&#160;</i>not harm&#160;them&#160;there.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;As you wish, my&#160;lord,&#34; Alecto said. &#34;And the woman's body?&#160;<br/>
&#34;Take her as&#160;well,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>he said bitterly.&#160;&#34;Give<i>&#160;</i>her the ancient rites.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Alecto, the children, and Maria's body dissolved into&#160;shadows, leaving Hades alone in the ruins.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I warned you,&#34; a new voice said.&#160;<br/>
Hades turned. A girl in a&#160;multicolored&#160;dress stood&#160;by&#160;the smoldering remains&#160;of the sofa.&#160;She had&#160;<br/>
short black hair and sad&#160;eyes. She was&#160;no more than&#160;twelve. I didn't&#160;know her, but she looked strangely&#160;<br/>familiar.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You dare come here?&#34; Hades growled. &#34;I should&#160;blast&#160;you to&#160;dust!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You cannot,&#34;&#160;the girl said.&#160;&#34;The power&#160;of Delphi protects&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
With a chill,&#160;I realized I was looking at the Oracle of Delphi, back when she&#160;was alive and&#160;young.&#160;<br/>
Somehow, seeing her like this was even&#160;spookier than seeing her as a&#160;mummy.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You've killed the woman&#160;I loved!&#34; Hades roared. &#34;Your prophecy&#160;brought us to&#160;this.'&#34;&#160;<br/>
He loomed over the girl, but she didn't flinch.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Zeus ordained the explosion to destroy the children,&#34; she said,&#160;&#34;because you defied his will. I had&#160;<br/>
nothing&#160;to&#160;do&#160;with it. And&#160;I did warn&#160;you to hide them&#160;sooner.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I couldn't! Maria would not let me! Besides, they&#160;were innocent.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nevertheless, they&#160;are your children, which&#160;makes them&#160;dangerous. Even if you put them away&#160;in&#160;<br/>
the Lotus Hotel, you only&#160;delay&#160;the problem.&#160;Nico and&#160;Bianca will never be able to&#160;rejoin the world lest&#160;<br/>they turn sixteen.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Because of your so-called Great Prophecy. And&#160;you have forced me&#160;into an oath to have no other&#160;<br/>
children. You&#160;have left me&#160;with nothing!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I foresee the future,&#34; the girl said. &#34;I cannot change it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=108></a>Black fire lit the god's eyes, and I&#160;knew&#160;something bad was coming. I wanted to&#160;yell at the girl&#160;to hide&#160;<br/>
or run.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then, Oracle, hear the words of Hades,&#34; he growled. &#34;Perhaps I&#160;cannot bring&#160;back Maria.&#160;Nor can&#160;I&#160;<br/>
bring&#160;yon an&#160;early&#160;death. But&#160;your soul is&#160;still&#160;mortal, and I&#160;<i>can&#160;</i>curse you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The girl's&#160;eyes widened. &#34;You would&#160;not—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I swear,&#34; Hades said, &#34;as&#160;long as my&#160;children remain&#160;outcasts, as long as I labor under the curse of&#160;<br/>
your Great Prophecy, the&#160;Oracle of<i>&#160;</i>Delphi will&#160;never have another mortal host. You will&#160;never rest in&#160;<br/>peace. No other will take&#160;your&#160;place. Your body will&#160;wither and&#160;die, and still&#160;the Oracle's spirit will&#160;be&#160;<br/>locked inside you. You will speak your bitter prophecies until you crumble to nothing. The Oracle will&#160;<br/>die with&#160;you!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The girl screamed, and the&#160;misty&#160;image was blasted&#160;to shreds. Nico fell to his&#160;knees in Persephone's&#160;<br/>
garden, his face&#160;white with<i>&#160;&#160;</i>shock. Standing in&#160;front&#160;of him&#160;was the real Hades, towering in his black&#160;<br/>robes and scowling down at&#160;his son<b>.</b>&#160;<br/>
&#34;And just what,&#34; he asked Nico, &#34;do&#160;you think&#160;you're doing?&#34;&#160;<br/>
A black explosion filled my&#160;dreams. Then the scene changed.&#160;<br/>
Rachel Elizabeth Dare was walking along a white&#160;sand beach. She wore a swimsuit with&#160;a T-shirt&#160;<br/>
wrapped around her waist. Her shoulders and face were&#160;sunburned.&#160;<br/>
She knelt and began writing in the surf with her finger. I tried to&#160;make out the letters. I thought my&#160;<br/>
dyslexia was&#160;acting up until I realized she was&#160;writing in Ancient Greek.&#160;<br/>
That was impossible. The dream&#160;had to be false.&#160;<br/>
Rachel finished writing a few words and muttered, &#34;What in the&#160;world?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I can read Greek, but I only&#160;recognized&#160;one&#160;word before the sea washed it away:&#160;Περσεύς. My&#160;name:&#160;<br/>
<i>Perseus.</i>&#160;<br/>
Rachel stood abruptly&#160;and&#160;backed away&#160;from&#160;the surf.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, gods,&#34;&#160;she said.&#160;<i>&#34;That's&#160;</i>what it means.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She turned and ran, kicking up sand as she raced back to&#160;her family's&#160;villa.&#160;<br/>
She pounded&#160;up the porch&#160;steps, breathing hard. Her&#160;father looked&#160;up from&#160;his&#160;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dad.&#34; Rachel marched up to him.&#160;&#34;We have to go&#160;back.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her dad's&#160;mouth twitched,&#160;like he was trying to&#160;remember how to&#160;smile. &#34;Back? We just got&#160;here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;There's trouble in New York. Percy's in danger.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Did he call you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No . . .&#160;not exactly. But I&#160;<i>know.&#160;</i>It's&#160;a feeling.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mr. Dare folded his newspaper. &#34;Your mother and&#160;I&#160;have been looking forward to this vacation for a&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=109></a>long time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No&#160;you&#160;haven't! You both&#160;hate the beach!&#160;You're just too stubborn&#160;to admit it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Now, Rachel—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm telling you something&#160;is wrong in New&#160;York! The&#160;whole city . . . I don't know what exactly, but&#160;<br/>
it's under attack.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her father sighed. &#34;I think&#160;we would've&#160;heard some&#160;thing like that&#160;on the news.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; Rachel insisted. &#34;Not this kind&#160;of attack. Have you had any calls since we got here?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her father frowned. &#34;No . .&#160;. but it&#160;is the&#160;weekend, in the middle of the summer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You&#160;<i>always&#160;</i>get calls,&#34; Rachel said. &#34;You've got to admit that's&#160;strange.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her father hesitated. &#34;We can't just&#160;leave. We've&#160;spent a lot of money.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Look,&#34; Rachel said. &#34;Daddy&#160;. .&#160;. Percy&#160;needs&#160;me. I&#160;have to deliver a&#160;message. It's&#160;life or death.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What message? What are you talking about?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I can't&#160;tell you.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then&#160;you can't&#160;go.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel closed&#160;her eyes like she was getting up her courage. &#34;Dad . . . let me&#160;go, and I'll make a deal&#160;<br/>
with you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mr. Dare sat&#160;forward. Deals were&#160;something&#160;he understood. &#34;I'm&#160;listening.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Clarion Ladies Academy.&#160;I'll—I'll go there in the fall.&#160;I won't even&#160;complain. But you&#160;have to&#160;get&#160;me&#160;<br/>
back to New York&#160;<i>right now.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
He was silent&#160;for a long time. Then&#160;he opened his phone and made a call.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Douglas? Prep the plane.&#160;We're leaving for New York. Yes . . . immediately.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel flung her arms around&#160;him,&#160;and her father&#160;seemed surprised, like she'd never hugged him&#160;<br/>
before.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll&#160;make it up to&#160;you, Dad!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He smiled, but his expression was chilly. He studied&#160;her like&#160;he&#160;wasn't seeing&#160;his daughter—just the&#160;<br/>
young lady&#160;he&#160;wanted her to be, once Clarion Academy&#160;got through with her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, Rachel,&#34; he agreed. &#34;You most certainly&#160;will.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The scene faded. I mumbled in my&#160;sleep: &#34;Rachel, no!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was still tossing and turning when Thalia shook me&#160;awake.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; she said. &#34;Come on. It's&#160;late afternoon. We've got visitors.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I sat up, disoriented. The bed was too comfortable, and I hated sleeping in&#160;the middle of the&#160;day.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a>&#34;Visitors?&#34; I&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
Thalia nodded grimly. &#34;A Titan wants to see you,&#160;under a flag of truce. He&#160;has a&#160;message from&#160;<br/>
Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
THIRTEEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
A &#160; TITAN &#160;BRINGS &#160;ME&#160;<br/>
A &#160;PRESENT&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
We could see the white flag from&#160;half a mile away. It&#160;was as&#160;big as a soccer field,&#160;carried by&#160;a&#160;thirty-foot-<br/>tall giant with&#160;bright&#160;blue skin and icy gray&#160;hair.&#160;<br/>
&#34;A Hyperborean,&#34; Thalia&#160;said. &#34;The giants of the&#160;north. It's&#160;a bad sign that they&#160;sided with&#160;Kronos.&#160;<br/>
They're usually peaceful.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You've&#160;met them?&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mmm. There's a big colony&#160;in Alberta. You do&#160;<i>not&#160;&#160;</i>want to get into a snowball fight with those&#160;<br/>
guys.&#34;&#160;<br/>
As the giant&#160;got closer, I could see three human-size envoys with&#160;him:&#160;a half-blood in&#160;armor,&#160;an&#160;<br/>
<i>empousa&#160;</i>demon with a black dress and flaming hair, and a tall&#160;man&#160;in a tuxedo. The&#160;<i>empousa&#160;</i>held the tux&#160;<br/>dude's&#160;arm,&#160;so they&#160;looked&#160;like a couple&#160;on their way&#160;to a Broadway show or something—&#160;<br/>
except for her flaming hair and fangs.&#160;<br/>
The group walked leisurely&#160;toward the&#160;Heckscher&#160;Playground.&#160;The swings&#160;and ball courts were&#160;<br/>
empty.&#160;The&#160;only&#160;sound was the fountain&#160;on Umpire Rock.&#160;<br/>
I looked at Grover. &#34;The tux dude is the Titan?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He nodded nervously.&#160;&#34;He looks like a&#160;magician. I hate&#160;magicians. They&#160;usually have rabbits.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at him.&#160;&#34;You're scared of bunnies?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blah-hah-hah! They're big bullies. Always&#160;stealing celery from&#160;defenseless satyrs!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia coughed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; Grover demanded.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll have to work on&#160;your bunny&#160;phobia later,&#34; I said. &#34;Here they come.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The&#160;man in the tux stepped forward. He was taller than an average human—about seven feet. His&#160;<br/>
black hair was tied in a&#160;ponytail. Dark round&#160;glasses&#160;covered his eyes, but&#160;what really&#160;caught&#160;my&#160;<br/>attention was the skin on&#160;his face. It was&#160;covered in&#160;scratches, like he'd been attacked by&#160;a small animal—<br/>a really,&#160;<i>really&#160;</i>mad hamster, maybe.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34;&#160;he said in a silky&#160;voice. &#34;It's a great&#160;honor.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=111></a>His lady&#160;friend the&#160;<i>empousa&#160;</i>hissed at me. She'd probably&#160;heard&#160;how&#160;I'd destroyed two&#160;of&#160;her sisters&#160;<br/>
last summer.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My dear,&#34; Tux Dude said&#160;to her. &#34;Why&#160;don't&#160;you make yourself comfortable over there, eh?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She released his arm&#160;and drifted over to&#160;a park bench.&#160;<br/>
I glanced at the armed demigod behind&#160;Tux Dude.&#160;1&#160;hadn't recognized him&#160;in his new helmet, but it&#160;<br/>
was&#160;my&#160;old&#160;backstabbing buddy Ethan&#160;Nakamura. His nose looked&#160;<b>like&#160;</b>a squashed tomato from&#160;our fight&#160;<br/>on the Williamsburg Bridge. That made&#160;me feel better.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, Ethan,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;You're looking&#160;good.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan glared&#160;at&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;To business.&#34; Tux Dude extended his hand. &#34;I am&#160;Prometheus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was too surprised to shake. &#34;The fire-stealer&#160;guy? The chained-to-the-rock-with-the-vultures guy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus&#160;winced. He touched the scratches on his face.&#160;&#160;&#34;Please, don't&#160;mention the vultures. But&#160;<br/>
yes, I&#160;stole fire from&#160;the gods and&#160;gave it to&#160;your ancestors. In return, the ever merciful Zeus had me&#160;<br/>chained to a rock and tortured for all eternity.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;How did I&#160;get free? Hercules did that,&#160;eons ago. So&#160;you see,<i>&#160;</i>I&#160;have a soft spot&#160;for heroes. Some of&#160;<br/>
you can be quite civilized.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Unlike the company&#160;you&#160;keep,&#34; I noticed.&#160;<br/>
I was looking&#160;at Ethan, but&#160;Prometheus apparently&#160;thought I meant the&#160;<i>empousa.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, demons aren't&#160;so bad,&#34; he said. &#34;You just have to&#160;keep them&#160;well fed. Now, Percy&#160;Jackson, let&#160;<br/>
us parley.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He waved&#160;me toward a picnic table and&#160;we&#160;sat down. Thalia and Grover stood&#160;behind me.&#160;<br/>
The blue giant propped his white flag against a tree&#160;and began absently&#160;playing on&#160;the playground. He&#160;<br/>
stepped on the&#160;monkey&#160;bars and crushed them, but he didn't seem&#160;angry.&#160;He just frowned and said, &#34;Uh-<br/>oh.&#34; Then he stepped in the fountain and broke the concrete bowl in&#160;half. &#34;Uh-oh.&#34; The water froze where&#160;<br/>his foot touched it. A bunch of stuffed animals hung from&#160;his belt—the huge kind&#160;you get for grand prizes&#160;<br/>at an arcade.&#160;He reminded me of Tyson,&#160;and the idea of fighting him&#160;made&#160;me sad.&#160;<br/>
Prometheus sat forward and laced his fingers. He&#160;looked earnest, kindly, and wise. &#34;Percy,&#160;your&#160;<br/>
position is weak. You know you can't stop another assault.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll see.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus looked pained, like he really&#160;cared&#160;what happened to&#160;me. &#34;Percy, I'm&#160;the&#160;Titan of&#160;<br/>
forethought. I&#160;know what's&#160;going&#160;to happen.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Also the Titan of crafty&#160;counsel,&#34; Grover put in.&#160;&#34;Emphasis on&#160;<i>crafty.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus shrugged. &#34;True enough, satyr. But I supported the gods in the last war. I told Kronos:&#160;<br/>
'You don't have the strength. You'll lose.'&#160;And I was&#160;right. So&#160;you see, I know&#160;how to pick the winning&#160;<br/>side. This time, I'm backing Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Because&#160;Zeus chained you to a rock,&#34; I&#160;guessed.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=112></a>&#34;Partly,&#160;yes. I won't deny&#160;I want revenge. But that's&#160;not the only reason I'm&#160;supporting Kronos. It's&#160;<br/>
the wisest choice. I'm here because I thought&#160;you might listen to reason.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He drew a&#160;map on&#160;the table with his finger. Wherever he touched,&#160;golden&#160;lines&#160;appeared, glowing on&#160;<br/>
the concrete.&#160;&#34;This is Manhattan. We&#160;have armies here, here, here,&#160;and here. We know your numbers. We&#160;<br/>outnumber you twenty&#160;to&#160;one.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your spy&#160;has been keeping&#160;you posted,&#34; I guessed.&#160;<br/>
Prometheus smiled apologetically.&#160;&#34;At&#160;any rate, our&#160;forces are growing daily.&#160;Tonight, Kronos will&#160;<br/>
attack. You will be overwhelmed. You've fought&#160;bravely,&#160;but there's just no way&#160;you can hold all of&#160;<br/>Manhattan. You'll be forced&#160;to retreat&#160;to the Empire&#160;State Building. There you'll be destroyed. I have&#160;seen&#160;<br/>this. It&#160;<i>will&#160;</i>happen.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought about the&#160;picture Rachel had drawn in my&#160;dreams—an army&#160;at the base of the Empire State&#160;<br/>
Building. I remembered the words of the young girl&#160;Oracle&#160;in&#160;my&#160;dream:&#160;<i>I foresee the future. I cannot&#160;</i><br/>
<i>change it.&#160;</i>Prometheus spoke with such certainty&#160;it&#160;was hard not to&#160;believe him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I won't let it happen,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Prometheus brushed a speck off his tux lapel. &#34;Understand, Percy.&#160;You are refighting the Trojan War&#160;<br/>
here. Patterns&#160;repeat themselves in history.&#160;They&#160;reappear just as&#160;monsters do. A&#160;great siege. Two armies.&#160;<br/>The only&#160;difference is, this time&#160;you are defending.&#160;<i>You&#160;</i>are Troy. And&#160;you know what happened to the&#160;<br/>Trojans, don't&#160;you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So&#160;you're going to cram a wooden horse into the elevator at the Empire State Building?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good luck.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus smiled. &#34;Troy was completely&#160;destroyed, Percy.&#160;You don't want that to happen here.&#160;<br/>
Stand down,&#160;and New York will<i>&#160;</i>be spared. Your forces will&#160;be granted amnesty.&#160;I will personally&#160;assure&#160;<br/>your safety. Let Kronos take Olympus. Who cares? Typhon will destroy the gods .my&#160;way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Right,&#34; I said. &#34;And I'm&#160;supposed to&#160;believe Kronos would spare the city.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;All he wants is Olympus,&#34; Prometheus&#160;promised.&#160;&#34;The&#160;might of the gods is tied to their seats of&#160;<br/>
power. You saw what happened to Poseidon&#160;once his&#160;undersea palace was attacked.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I winced, remembering how old and decrepit my&#160;father looked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#34; Prometheus said sadly.&#160;&#34;I know that was hard&#160;for you. When Kronos destroys&#160;Olympus, the&#160;<br/>
gods will fade. They will&#160;become&#160;so weak they will&#160;be&#160;easily&#160;defeated. Kronos&#160;would rather&#160;do this while&#160;<br/>Typhon has the Olympians distracted in the west<i>.&#160;</i>Much easier. Fewer lives lost. But make no&#160;mistake, the&#160;<br/>best you can&#160;do is slow us&#160;down.&#160;The&#160;day after tomorrow, Typhon arrives in&#160;New York, and&#160;you will&#160;<br/>have no chance at all. The gods and Mount Olympus will still be destroyed, but it will be&#160;much&#160;messier.&#160;<br/>Much, much worse for you and&#160;your city. Either way,&#160;the Titans will rule.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia pounded her fist on the table.&#160;&#34;I serve Artemis. The Hunters&#160;will fight to our last breath. Percy,&#160;<br/>
you're not seriously&#160;going&#160;to&#160;listen to this&#160;slimeball, are you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I figured Prometheus&#160;was&#160;going to&#160;blast her, but he just smiled. &#34;Your courage does you credit, Thalia&#160;<br/>
Grace.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=113></a>Thalia stiffened. &#34;That's&#160;my mother's&#160;surname. I don't use it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;As you wish,&#34; Prometheus&#160;said casually, but I could tell he'd<i>&#160;</i>gotten under&#160;her&#160;skin. I'd never even&#160;<br/>
heard Thalia's last name&#160;before. Somehow it&#160;made&#160;her seem&#160;almost normal. Less&#160;mysterious and&#160;<br/>powerful.&#160;<br/>
&#34;At any&#160;rate,&#34;&#160;the Titan said, &#34;you need&#160;not be my<i>&#160;</i>enemy.&#160;I have always&#160;been a helper of<i>&#160;</i>mankind.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's a load&#160;of Minotaur dung,&#34; Thalia said.&#160;&#34;When mankind first sacrificed to the gods,&#160;you&#160;<br/>
tricked them&#160;into giving&#160;you the best portion. You gave us fire to annoy&#160;the gods, not&#160;because you cared&#160;<br/>about us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus shook&#160;his head. &#34;You don't understand. I&#160;helped shape your nature.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A wiggling lump&#160;of clay&#160;appeared in his hands. He fashioned it into<i>&#160;</i>a little doll with legs and arms.&#160;<br/>
The lump&#160;man didn't have any&#160;eyes, but&#160;it groped around the table,&#160;stumbling over Prometheus's&#160;fingers.&#160;<br/>&#34;I have been&#160;whispering in&#160;man's ear since the beginning of&#160;your&#160;existence. I represent your curiosity,&#160;<br/>your sense of&#160;exploration,&#160;your inventiveness. Help me&#160;save you,&#160;Percy.&#160;Do&#160;this, and I will&#160;give mankind&#160;<br/>a new gift—a new revelation that will&#160;move you as far forward&#160;as fire did.<i>&#160;</i>You can't&#160;make&#160;that kind of&#160;<br/>advance under the gods. They would&#160;never allow it.&#160;But this could be a&#160;new golden age for&#160;you.&#160;Or .&#160;.&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>He&#160;made a fist&#160;and smashed&#160;the clay man into a&#160;pancake.&#160;<br/>
The blue giant rumbled, &#34;Uh-oh.&#34; Over at&#160;the park bench, the&#160;<i>empousa&#160;</i>bared her fangs in a smile.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#160;you&#160;know the Titans and their offspring are not all bad,&#34; Prometheus&#160;said. &#34;You've&#160;met&#160;<br/>
Calypso.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;face felt hot. &#34;That's different.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;How? Much like&#160;me, she&#160;did nothing&#160;wrong, and yet she was exiled<i>&#160;</i>forever simply&#160;because she&#160;was&#160;<br/>
Atlas's daughter. We are not&#160;your&#160;enemies. Don't&#160;let the worst&#160;happen,&#34;&#160;he&#160;pleaded. &#34;We offer&#160;you&#160;<br/>peace.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked at Ethan Nakamura. &#34;You must&#160;hate this.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know what you mean.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;If we took this deal,&#160;you wouldn't get revenge. You wouldn't&#160;get to kill us all. Isn't that what you&#160;<br/>
want?&#34;&#160;<br/>
His good eye&#160;flared. &#34;All I want is respect, Jackson.&#160;The gods never gave me that. You wanted me&#160;to&#160;<br/>
go to&#160;your stupid camp, spend my&#160;time crammed into&#160;the Hermes&#160;cabin because I'm&#160;not important? Not&#160;<br/>even recognized?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He sounded&#160;just like Luke when he'd&#160;tried to&#160;kill&#160;me in the woods at camp four&#160;years ago. The&#160;<br/>
memory&#160;made&#160;my&#160;hand&#160;ache where the pit scorpion&#160;had stung me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your mom's the goddess of revenge,&#34; I&#160;told Ethan. &#34;We should respect that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nemesis stands for balance! When people have too&#160;much good luck, she tears them&#160;down.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Which is why she took&#160;your eye?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It was payment,&#34; he growled. &#34;In exchange, she swore to&#160;me&#160;that one day&#160;I would tip the balance of&#160;<br/>
power. I would bring the minor gods respect. An eye&#160;was a small price to pay.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=114></a>&#34;Great&#160;mom.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;At least she&#160;keeps her word, unlike the&#160;Olympians. She always&#160;pays&#160;her&#160;debts—good&#160;or evil.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said. &#34;So I&#160;saved&#160;your life, and&#160;you&#160;repaid&#160;me by&#160;raising&#160;Kronos. That's&#160;fair.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan grabbed the hilt&#160;of his sword, but&#160;Prometheus stopped&#160;him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Now, now,&#34;&#160;the Titan said. &#34;We're on a&#160;diplomatic&#160;mission.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus studied me&#160;as&#160;if trying to&#160;understand my&#160;anger. Then&#160;he&#160;nodded&#160;like he'd&#160;just picked a&#160;<br/>
thought from&#160;my&#160;brain.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It bothers&#160;you what happened to Luke,&#34;&#160;he decided. &#34;Hestia didn't&#160;show you the&#160;full story.&#160;Perhaps if&#160;<br/>
you&#160;understood . .&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Titan reached out.&#160;<br/>
Thalia cried a&#160;warning, but&#160;before I could react, Prometheus's index finger touched my&#160;forehead.&#160;<br/>
* * *&#160;<br/>
Suddenly I was back in May&#160;Castellan's living room. Candles flickered on the fireplace&#160;mantel, reflected&#160;<br/>in the mirrors along the walls. Through the kitchen doorway&#160;I could see Thalia sitting at the&#160;table while&#160;<br/>Ms. Castellan bandaged her&#160;wounded leg. Seven-year-old Annabeth&#160;sat next to her, playing with a&#160;<br/>Medusa beanbag toy.&#160;<br/>
Hermes and Luke stood apart in the living room.&#160;<br/>
The god's face looked liquid in the candlelight, like&#160;he couldn't decide what&#160;shape to adopt. He was&#160;<br/>
dressed in a navy&#160;blue jogging outfit with&#160;winged Reeboks.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why&#160;show&#160;yourself now?&#34; Luke demanded. His shoulders&#160;were tense, as if he&#160;expected a fight. &#34;All&#160;<br/>
these years I've been calling to&#160;you, praying&#160;you'd show up, and nothing. You left&#160;me&#160;with&#160;<i>her.</i>&#34;<i>&#160;&#160;</i>He&#160;<br/>pointed toward the kitchen&#160;like he couldn't bear&#160;to look at his mother,&#160;much less&#160;say&#160;her name.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke, do not&#160;dishonor her,&#34; Hermes&#160;warned. &#34;Your mother did the&#160;best she could. As for&#160;me,&#160;I could&#160;<br/>
not interfere&#160;with&#160;your&#160;path. The children of the&#160;gods&#160;must find their own way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So it was for my&#160;own good. Growing up&#160;on the streets, fending for myself, fighting monsters.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're&#160;my&#160;son,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;I knew&#160;you had the&#160;ability.&#160;When I was only a&#160;baby, I&#160;crawled from&#160;<br/>
my&#160;cradle and set out for—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm not a god! Just once, you could've said&#160;something. You could've helped when&#34;—he took an&#160;<br/>
unsteady&#160;breath, lowering&#160;his voice so no one in&#160;the&#160;kitchen could overhear—&#34;when she was having one&#160;<br/>of her<i>&#160;fits,&#160;</i>shaking me&#160;and saying crazy things about&#160;my&#160;fate. When I used to hide in the closet so she&#160;<br/>wouldn't find&#160;me with those . . . those glowing eyes.&#160;Did&#160;you&#160;even&#160;<i>care&#160;</i>that I was scared?&#160;Did&#160;you even&#160;<br/>know when I&#160;finally ran away?&#34;&#160;<br/>
In the kitchen, Ms. Castellan chattered&#160;aimlessly,&#160;pouring Kool-Aid for Thalia and Annabeth as she&#160;<br/>
told them&#160;stories about Luke as&#160;a baby. Thalia rubbed her bandaged leg nervously. Annabeth&#160;glanced into&#160;<br/>the living room&#160;and held up a burned cookie for Luke to see. She mouthed,&#160;<i>Can&#160;we go now?</i>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=115></a>&#34;Luke, I care&#160;very&#160;much,&#34; Hermes&#160;said&#160;slowly, &#34;but&#160;gods&#160;must not interfere directly&#160;in mortal affairs.&#160;<br/>
It is one&#160;of our Ancient Laws. Especially when&#160;your&#160;destiny&#160;. .&#160;.&#34;&#160;His voice trailed off. He&#160;stared at the&#160;<br/>candles as if remembering something unpleasant.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; Luke&#160;asked. &#34;What about my&#160;destiny?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You should&#160;not have come back,&#34; Hermes&#160;muttered. &#34;It only upsets you both. However, I see now&#160;<br/>
that you are getting too old to be on the run without&#160;help. I'll&#160;speak&#160;with Chiron at Camp&#160;Half-Blood and&#160;<br/>ask him&#160;to send a satyr&#160;to&#160;collect you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We're doing&#160;fine without your help,&#34;&#160;Luke growled. &#34;Now, what were you saying about my&#160;<br/>
destiny?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The wings on&#160;Hermes's&#160;Reeboks fluttered restlessly. He studied his son like he was trying to&#160;<br/>
memorize his face, and suddenly&#160;a cold feeling washed through me. I realized&#160;Hermes&#160;<i>knew&#160;what&#160;</i>May&#160;<br/>Castellan's&#160;mutterings&#160;meant. I wasn't&#160;sure how, but looking&#160;at his face I&#160;was absolutely&#160;certain. Hermes&#160;<br/>understood what would happen to Luke&#160;someday,&#160;how he would turn evil.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My&#160;son,&#34; he said, &#34;I'm the god of travelers, the god of loads. If I know anything, I know that you&#160;<br/>
must walk your own path,&#160;even though it<i>&#160;</i>tears my&#160;heart.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You don't love me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I promise&#160;I&#160;. . . I do love&#160;you. Go to&#160;camp. I will&#160;see that you&#160;get a quest soon. Perhaps&#160;you can&#160;<br/>
defeat the Hydra, or steal the apples of Hesperides.&#160;You will get&#160;a chance to be a great hero before . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Before what?&#34; Luke's&#160;voice was trembling now. &#34;What did my&#160;mom&#160;see that&#160;made her like this?&#160;<br/>
What's&#160;going to happen to&#160;me? If you love me,&#160;<i>tell&#160;</i>me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes's&#160;expression tightened. &#34;I<i>&#160;</i>cannot.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then&#160;you don't&#160;care!&#34; Luke yelled.&#160;<br/>
In the kitchen, the talking died abruptly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke?&#34; May Castellan called. &#34;Is that&#160;you? Is my&#160;boy&#160;all right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Luke turned&#160;to hide&#160;his face, but I could see the tears in his eyes. &#34;I'm&#160;fine. I have a new family. I&#160;<br/>
don't need either of&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;your father,&#34; Hermes&#160;insisted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;A<i>&#160;father&#160;</i>is supposed to&#160;be around. I've never even&#160;<i>met&#160;&#160;</i>you. Thalia, Annabeth, come on! We're&#160;<br/>
leaving!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;My boy, don't go!&#34; May&#160;Castellan called after him.&#160;&#34;I have&#160;your lunch ready!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Luke stormed&#160;out&#160;the door,&#160;Thalia and Annabeth scrambling after him.&#160;May&#160;Castellan tried to follow,&#160;<br/>
but Hermes held her back.&#160;<br/>
As the screen&#160;door slammed, May&#160;collapsed in&#160;Hermes's&#160;arms and began to shake.&#160;Her eyes&#160;<br/>
opened—glowing green—and she clutched&#160;desperately at Hermes's shoulders.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=116></a>&#34;<i>My son</i>,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>she hissed in a dry voice.&#160;<i>&#34;Danger. Terrible&#160;fate!&#34;&#160;</i><br/>
&#34;I know, my&#160;love,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>Hermes said sadly.&#160;&#34;Believe&#160;me, I know.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The image faded. Prometheus pulled his&#160;hand away&#160;from&#160;my&#160;forehead.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy?&#34; Thalia asked. &#34;What . . . what&#160;was that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I realized<i>&#160;</i>I was clammy&#160;with sweat.&#160;<br/>
Prometheus nodded sympathetically. &#34;Appalling, isn't&#160;it? The gods know what is to come, and&#160;yet&#160;<br/>
they&#160;do&#160;nothing, even for their children. How long did it take for them&#160;to tell you&#160;your<i>&#160;</i>prophecy, Percy&#160;<br/>Jackson? Don't you think&#160;your father&#160;knows what will&#160;happen to&#160;you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was too stunned to answer.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Perrrcy,&#34; Grover warned, &#34;he's playing&#160;with&#160;your mind. Trying to&#160;make you angry.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover could&#160;read emotions, so he probably&#160;knew Prometheus was&#160;succeeding.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Do you really&#160;blame your friend Luke?&#34; the Titan asked&#160;me. &#34;And what about&#160;you, Percy?&#160;Will you&#160;<br/>
be&#160;controlled by&#160;your&#160;fate? Kronos&#160;offers&#160;you a much better deal.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I clenched&#160;my&#160;fists. As much&#160;as I hated what Prometheus had shown me, I hated Kronos a lot more.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll give you a deal. Tell Kronos to call&#160;off his attack,&#160;leave Luke&#160;Castellan's body,&#160;and return to the pits&#160;<br/>of<i>&#160;</i>Tartarus. Then maybe I won't have to destroy him,&#34;&#160;<br/>
The&#160;<i>empousa&#160;</i>snarled. Her&#160;hair erupted in fresh flames, but Prometheus just sighed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;If&#160;you change&#160;your mind,&#34; he said, &#34;I have a gift for&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A Greek vase appeared on&#160;the table. It&#160;was about three feet high and a foot&#160;wide, glazed<i>&#160;</i>with black-<br/>
and-white geometric designs. The ceramic&#160;lid was fastened with a leather harness.&#160;<br/>
Grover whimpered when he saw it.&#160;<br/>
Thalia gasped. &#34;That's not—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#34; Prometheus said. &#34;You recognize it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Looking&#160;at the jar, I felt a strange sense&#160;of fear, but I&#160;had no idea why.&#160;<br/>
&#34;This belonged to my&#160;sister-in-law,&#34; Prometheus explained. &#34;Pandora.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A lump&#160;formed in my&#160;throat. &#34;As in Pandora's box?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus shook his head. &#34;I don't know how this&#160;<i>box&#160;</i>business&#160;got started. It was never a box. It&#160;<br/>
was a&#160;<i>pithos,&#160;</i>a storage jar. I suppose Pandora's&#160;<i>pithos&#160;</i>doesn't&#160;have the same&#160;ring to it, but&#160;never&#160;mind&#160;<br/>that. Yes, she did open this jar, which contained&#160;most of the&#160;demons that&#160;now haunt mankind—fear,&#160;<br/>death, hunger, sickness.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't forget me,&#34; the&#160;<i>empousa&#160;</i>purred.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=117></a>&#34;Indeed,&#34; Prometheus&#160;conceded. &#34;The first&#160;<i>empousa&#160;</i>was also trapped in this&#160;jar, released by&#160;Pandora.&#160;<br/>
But what I find curious about the story—Pandora always&#160;gets the blame. She is punished for being&#160;<br/>curious. The&#160;gods would have&#160;you believe that this&#160;is the lesson: mankind should not&#160;explore. They&#160;<br/>should not ask questions.&#160;They&#160;should&#160;do what they&#160;are&#160;told. In truth, Percy,&#160;this jar was&#160;a trap designed&#160;<br/>by&#160;Zeus and&#160;the other gods. It was revenge on&#160;<i>me&#160;&#160;</i>and&#160;my&#160;entire family—my&#160;poor simple brother&#160;<br/>Epimetheus and his wife Pandora. The&#160;gods knew she&#160;would&#160;open the jar. They&#160;were willing to punish&#160;<br/>the entire race of humanity along with&#160;us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought about my&#160;dream&#160;of Hades&#160;and Maria di&#160;Angelo. Zeus had destroyed an entire hotel to&#160;<br/>
eliminate two&#160;demigod children—just to save his own skin, because he was&#160;scared of a prophecy. He'd&#160;<br/>killed an innocent woman and&#160;probably hadn't lost&#160;any sleep over it. Hades was no better. He wasn't&#160;<br/>powerful enough to&#160;take his revenge&#160;on&#160;Zeus, so he cursed the Oracle, dooming a young girl&#160;to&#160;a horrible&#160;<br/>fate. And Hermes . . . why&#160;had he abandoned Luke?&#160;Why&#160;hadn't he at least&#160;warned Luke, or&#160;tried to raise&#160;<br/>him&#160;better&#160;so he wouldn't turn evil?&#160;<br/>
Maybe Prometheus was toying with my&#160;mind.&#160;<br/>
<i>But what if&#160;he's right?&#160;</i>part of me&#160;wondered.&#160;<i>How are the gods any&#160;better than the Titans?</i>&#160;<br/>
Prometheus tapped the lid&#160;of Pandora's jar. &#34;Only&#160;one spirit remained inside when Pandora opened&#160;<br/>
it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hope,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Prometheus looked pleased. &#34;Very&#160;good, Percy.&#160;Elpis, the Spirit of Hope, would not abandon&#160;<br/>
humanity. Hope does not&#160;leave without being given permission. She can only&#160;be released by&#160;a child&#160;of&#160;<br/>man.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Titan slid the jar across the table.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I give&#160;you this as a&#160;reminder of what the gods are like,&#34; he said. &#34;Keep Elpis, if you wish. But if you&#160;<br/>
decide that&#160;you&#160;have seen enough&#160;destruction, enough futile suffering, then open the jar.&#160;Let Elpis go.&#160;<br/>Give up Hope, and I will&#160;know that you are&#160;surrendering. I promise Kronos will be lenient.&#160;He&#160;will<i>&#160;</i>spare&#160;<br/>the survivors.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared&#160;at the jar and got a&#160;very&#160;bad feeling. I figured&#160;Pandora had been completely&#160;ADHD, like&#160;me. I&#160;<br/>
could never leave things alone. I didn't like temptation. What if&#160;<i>this&#160;</i>was&#160;my&#160;choice? Maybe the prophecy&#160;<br/>all came down to my&#160;keeping this jar closed or opening&#160;it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't want the thing,&#34; I growled.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Too late,&#34; Prometheus said. &#34;The gift&#160;is given. It cannot be taken&#160;back.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He stood. The&#160;<i>empousa&#160;</i>came forward and slipped&#160;her arm&#160;through&#160;his.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Morrain!&#34; Prometheus called to the blue giant. &#34;We are leaving. Get&#160;your flag.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Uh-oh,&#34; the giant said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We will see&#160;you soon, Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34;&#160;Prometheus promised. &#34;One way&#160;or another.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=118></a>Ethan Nakamura gave&#160;me&#160;one last hateful look. Then the truce party&#160;turned and strolled up the lane&#160;<br/>
through Central Park, like it was just a regular sunny Sunday&#160;afternoon.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
FOURTEEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
PIGS &#160;FLY&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Back at the Plaza, Thalia pulled me&#160;aside. &#160;&#34;What did&#160;Prometheus show&#160;you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Reluctantly, I&#160;told her about the vision of May&#160;Castellan's house. Thalia rubbed her thigh like she was&#160;<br/>
remembering the old wound.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That was a&#160;bad night,&#34; she admitted. &#34;Annabeth&#160;was so little, I don't think she really&#160;understood&#160;<br/>
what she saw. She just knew Luke was upset.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked out&#160;the hotel windows at Central Park. Small fires were still burning in the north, but&#160;<br/>
otherwise the city&#160;seemed&#160;unnaturally&#160;peaceful. &#34;Do&#160;you&#160;know&#160;what happened to May&#160;Castellan? I&#160;<br/>mean—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know what&#160;you&#160;mean,&#34; Thalia said. &#34;I&#160;never saw&#160;her have an, um, episode, but Luke told&#160;me about&#160;<br/>
the glowing eyes, the strange things she would say.&#160;He&#160;made&#160;me&#160;promise never to tell. What caused it, I&#160;<br/>have no idea.&#160;If Luke knew, he never told&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hermes knew,&#34; I said. &#34;Something caused May&#160;to&#160;see&#160;parts of Luke's&#160;future, and Hermes understood&#160;<br/>
what would happen—how Luke would turn into&#160;Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia frowned. &#34;You can't be sure of<i>&#160;</i>that. Remember Prometheus was&#160;manipulating what&#160;you saw,&#160;<br/>
Percy,&#160;showing&#160;you&#160;what<i>&#160;</i>happened in&#160;the worst possible light. Hermes&#160;<i>did&#160;</i>love&#160;Luke. I&#160;could tell<i>&#160;</i>just&#160;by&#160;<br/>looking at his&#160;face. And Hermes was there that night&#160;because he&#160;was checking up on May,&#160;taking care of<i>&#160;<br/></i>her. He wasn't all bad.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's&#160;still not right,&#34; I insisted. &#34;Luke was just a&#160;little kid. Hermes never helped him,&#160;never&#160;stopped&#160;<br/>
him&#160;from&#160;running away.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia shouldered her bow.&#160;Again it&#160;struck me how&#160;much stronger&#160;she looked&#160;now that she'd stopped&#160;<br/>
aging. You could almost see a silvery&#160;glow around&#160;her—the blessing of Artemis.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>she&#160;said, &#34;you can't&#160;start feeling sorry&#160;for&#160;Luke. We all have tough&#160;things to&#160;deal with. All&#160;<br/>
demigods do<i>.&#160;</i>Our parents&#160;are hardly&#160;ever around. But Luke&#160;made&#160;bad choices.&#160;Nobody&#160;forced him to do&#160;<br/>that. In fact—&#34;&#160;<br/>
She glanced&#160;down the hall to&#160;make sure we were&#160;alone. &#34;I'm worried about Annabeth. If she has to&#160;<br/>
face Luke in battle, I don't know if she can do it. She's always&#160;had a soft spot for&#160;him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Blood rose to my&#160;face. &#34;She'll do fine.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=119></a>&#34;I don't know. After that night, after&#160;we left his mom's house? Luke was never the same. He got&#160;<br/>
reckless&#160;and moody, like he had something to&#160;prove.&#160;By the time Grover found us&#160;and tried to get&#160;us to&#160;<br/>camp&#160;. . . well, part of&#160;the reason we had so much trouble was because Luke&#160;wouldn't be&#160;careful. He&#160;<br/>wanted to pick a fight with every&#160;monster we&#160;crossed. Annabeth&#160;didn't see that&#160;as a problem. Luke&#160;was&#160;<br/>her hero. She only&#160;understood that his parents had&#160;made&#160;him&#160;sad,&#160;and she got very&#160;defensive of him.&#160;She&#160;<br/>still&#160;<i>is&#160;</i>defensive. All I'm&#160;saying&#160;. . . don't you fall into&#160;the same trap. Luke has given himself to Kronos&#160;<br/>now. We can't afford to be&#160;soft on him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked out&#160;at the fires in&#160;Harlem,&#160;wondering how&#160;many&#160;sleeping&#160;mortals&#160;were in danger right now&#160;<br/>
because of Luke's bad choices.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're right,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Thalia patted&#160;my&#160;shoulder. &#34;I'm going to check on&#160;the Hunters,&#160;then get some&#160;more sleep&#160;before&#160;<br/>
nightfall. You should crash too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The last thing I need is more dreams.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know, believe&#160;me.&#34; Her&#160;dark expression made&#160;me&#160;wonder what she'd been dreaming about. It was&#160;<br/>
a common demigod problem: the more dangerous our&#160;situation became, the worse and more frequent our&#160;<br/>dreams&#160;got. &#34;But Percy,&#160;there's no telling when you'll&#160;get another&#160;chance for rest. It's going to be a long&#160;<br/>night—maybe&#160;our&#160;<i>last&#160;</i>night.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't like it, but I knew she was right. I nodded wearily&#160;and gave&#160;her Pandora's jar. &#34;Do&#160;me&#160;a favor.&#160;<br/>
Lock this in the hotel vault,&#160;will&#160;you? I think I'm&#160;allergic to&#160;<i>pithos.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia smiled.&#160;&#34;You got it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I found the nearest bed and passed out. But of course sleep only&#160;brought more nightmares.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I saw the undersea palace of&#160;my&#160;father. The enemy&#160;army&#160;was&#160;closer now,&#160;entrenched only&#160;a few&#160;<br/>
hundred&#160;yards outside the&#160;palace. The fortress walls&#160;were completely&#160;destroyed. The temple&#160;my&#160;dad had&#160;<br/>used as his headquarters was burning&#160;with Greek fire.&#160;<br/>
I zoomed in on the armory, where my&#160;brother and&#160;some other Cyclopes were&#160;on lunch break, eating&#160;<br/>
from&#160;huge jars&#160;of Skippy&#160;extra-chunky&#160;peanut butter (and don't ask me how it tasted underwater, because&#160;<br/>I don't want to know). As&#160;I watched, the outer wall&#160;of the armory&#160;exploded. A Cyclops warrior stumbled&#160;<br/>inside, collapsing on the lunch table. Tyson knelt down&#160;to help, but it was too late. The Cyclops dissolved&#160;<br/>into sea silt.&#160;<br/>
Enemy&#160;giants moved toward the&#160;breach, and Tyson picked&#160;up&#160;the fallen warrior's club. He yelled&#160;<br/>
something to his fellow blacksmiths—probably&#160;&#34;For&#160;Poseidon!&#34;—but with his mouth full of peanut butter&#160;<br/>it sounded like &#34;PUH PTEH BUN!&#34;&#160;His brethren all grabbed hammers and&#160;chisels, yelled, &#34;PEANUT&#160;<br/>BUTTER!&#34; and charged behind Tyson<i>&#160;</i>into battle.&#160;<br/>
Then the scene shifted. I was&#160;with Ethan Nakamura&#160;at the enemy&#160;camp. What&#160;I saw&#160;made&#160;me shiver,&#160;<br/>
partly because the army&#160;was so huge,&#160;partly&#160;because&#160;I recognized the place.&#160;<br/>
We were in the backwoods of New Jersey, on a&#160;crumbling road lined with run-down businesses and&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=120></a>tattered billboard signs. A trampled fence ringed a big&#160;yard full of&#160;cement statuary. The sign above the&#160;<br/>warehouse was hard to read because it&#160;was in red&#160;cursive, but&#160;I knew what it said: AUNTY EM'S&#160;<br/>GARDEN GNOME EMPORIUM.&#160;<br/>
I hadn't thought about the&#160;place in&#160;years. It was&#160;clearly&#160;abandoned. The statues were&#160;broken and&#160;<br/>
spray-painted with graffiti. A&#160;cement satyr—Grover's Uncle Ferdinand—had lost his arm.&#160;Part of the&#160;<br/>warehouse roof had caved&#160;in. A big&#160;yellow sign pasted on the door&#160;read: CONDEMNED.&#160;<br/>
Hundreds of&#160;tents and fires surrounded&#160;the property.&#160;Mostly&#160;I saw&#160;monsters,&#160;but there were some&#160;<br/>
human&#160;mercenaries in combat fatigues and demigods&#160;in armor, too. A purple-and-black banner hung&#160;<br/>outside the emporium,&#160;guarded by&#160;two&#160;huge blue Hyperboreans.&#160;<br/>
Ethan was crouched at the&#160;nearest campfire. A couple of other demigods sat&#160;with him,&#160;sharpening&#160;<br/>
their swords. The doors of&#160;the warehouse&#160;opened, and&#160;Prometheus&#160;stepped out.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nakamura,&#34;&#160;he called. &#34;The master&#160;would like to speak to&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan stood&#160;up&#160;warily.&#160;&#34;Something wrong?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus smiled. &#34;You'll have to ask&#160;him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
One of the other demigods snickered. &#34;Nice knowing&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan readjusted his sword belt and headed into the warehouse.&#160;<br/>
Except for the hole in the roof, the place was just as&#160;1 remembered. Statues of terrified people stood&#160;<br/>
frozen in midscream. In the snack&#160;bar area, the picnic&#160;tables had been moved aside. Right&#160;between the&#160;<br/>soda dispenser and pretzel warmer stood a golden throne. Kronos lounged&#160;on it,&#160;his scythe across his lap.&#160;<br/>He wore jeans and a T-shirt, and with his brooding expression he looked almost&#160;human—like&#160;the younger&#160;<br/>version of Luke I'd seen in the vision,&#160;pleading with&#160;Hermes to tell him&#160;his fate. Then Luke&#160;saw Ethan,&#160;<br/>and his face contorted into&#160;a very&#160;inhuman smile. His&#160;golden eyes glowed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, Nakamura. What did&#160;you think&#160;of the diplomatic&#160;mission?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan hesitated. &#34;I'm&#160;sure&#160;Lord Prometheus is better suited to speak—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But I asked&#160;<i>you.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan's good eye darted back and forth,&#160;noting the&#160;guards that stood around&#160;Kronos. &#34;I . .&#160;. I don't&#160;<br/>
think Jackson will surrender. Ever.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos nodded. &#34;Anything else you wanted to tell me?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;N-no, sir.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You look&#160;nervous, Ethan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, sir. It's&#160;just . . . I&#160;heard this was the lair of —&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Medusa?&#160;Yes, quite true.&#160;Lovely&#160;place, eh?&#160;Unfortunately,&#160;Medusa hasn't&#160;re-formed since Jackson&#160;<br/>
killed her, so you needn't&#160;worry&#160;about&#160;joining her collection. Besides, there are&#160;much&#160;more dangerous&#160;<br/>forces in this room.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos looked over at a Laistrygonian giant who&#160;was&#160;munching noisily&#160;on some french fries. Kronos&#160;<br/>
waved his hand and the giant froze. A french fry&#160;hung&#160;suspended in midair halfway&#160;between&#160;his hand and&#160;<br/>his mouth.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=121></a>&#34;Why&#160;turn&#160;them&#160;to stone,&#34; Kronos asked, &#34;when&#160;you can freeze time itself?&#34;&#160;<br/>
His golden eyes bored into&#160;Ethan's face. &#34;Now, tell&#160;me one&#160;more thing. What&#160;happened last night on&#160;<br/>
the Williamsburg Bridge?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan trembled. Beads of perspiration&#160;were popping&#160;up on&#160;his forehead. &#34;I . . .&#160;I don't know,&#160;sir.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, you do.&#34; Kronos rose from&#160;his seat.&#160;&#34;When you attacked Jackson,&#160;something happened.&#160;<br/>
Something was not quite right. The&#160;girl,&#160;Annabeth, jumped in&#160;your&#160;way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;She wanted to save him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But he is invulnerable,&#34; Kronos said quietly.&#160;&#34;You saw that yourself.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I can't explain it. Maybe she forgot.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;She forgot,&#34;&#160;Kronos said.&#160;&#34;Yes, that&#160;must've been it.&#160;<i>Oh dear, I forgot my friend is invulnerable and&#160;</i><br/>
<i>took a knife for him. Oops.&#160;</i>Tell me, Ethan, where were you aiming when&#160;you stabbed at Jackson?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan frowned. He clasped his hand as if&#160;he were holding a&#160;blade,&#160;and mimed a&#160;thrust. &#34;I'm&#160;not sure,&#160;<br/>
sir. It all happened so fast. I wasn't&#160;aiming&#160;for any&#160;spot in particular.'&#160;<br/>
Kronos's&#160;fingers tapped the blade of his scythe. &#34;I see,&#34; he said in a chilly&#160;tone. &#34;If your memory&#160;<br/>
improves, I will expect—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Suddenly&#160;the Titan lord winced. The giant in the corner unfroze and the french fry&#160;fell into&#160;his&#160;mouth.&#160;<br/>
Kronos stumbled backward and sank into&#160;his throne.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My lord?&#34; Ethan started forward.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I—&#34; The voice was weak,&#160;but just for a&#160;moment&#160;it was Luke's. Then Kronos's&#160;expression hardened.&#160;<br/>
He raised his hand and flexed his fingers slowly&#160;as if forcing them&#160;to obey.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It is nothing,&#34; he said, his&#160;voice steely&#160;and cold again.&#160;&#34;A minor discomfort.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan moistened his lips. &#34;He's still fighting&#160;you, isn't he? Luke—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nonsense,&#34; Kronos spat. &#34;Repeat that&#160;lie, and I will cut out&#160;your&#160;tongue. The&#160;boy's soul has been&#160;<br/>
crushed. I am simply&#160;adjusting to&#160;the limits of this&#160;form. It requires rest. It is annoying,&#160;but&#160;no more than&#160;<br/>a temporary&#160;inconvenience.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;As . . . as you say, my&#160;lord.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You!&#34; Kronos pointed his scythe at a&#160;<i>dracaena&#160;</i>with green armor and a&#160;green&#160;crown. &#34;Queen&#160;Sess, is&#160;<br/>
it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yesssss, my&#160;lord.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is our little surprise ready&#160;to be unleashed?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The&#160;<i>dracaena&#160;</i>queen bared&#160;her fangs. &#34;Oh,&#160;yessss,&#160;my&#160;lord. Quite a lovely&#160;sssssurprissse.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Excellent,&#34;&#160;Kronos said.&#160;&#34;Tell my&#160;brother Hyperion&#160;to move our&#160;main force south into Central Park.&#160;<br/>
The half-bloods will be in&#160;such disarray&#160;they will not&#160;be able to&#160;defend themselves. Go now,&#160;Ethan. Work&#160;<br/>on improving&#160;your memory. We will talk&#160;again when&#160;we have taken Manhattan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan bowed,&#160;and my&#160;dreams shifted one last time. I saw<i>&#160;</i>the Big&#160;House at camp, but it was a different&#160;<br/>
era. The house was painted red instead of blue. The&#160;campers down at the volleyball pit&#160;had early '90s&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=122></a>hairstyles, which were probably&#160;good for&#160;keeping monsters away.&#160;<br/>
Chiron stood&#160;by&#160;the porch,&#160;talking to Hermes and&#160;a&#160;woman holding a baby. Chiron's hair was shorter&#160;<br/>
and darker.&#160;Hermes wore his usual jogging&#160;suit with his winged high-tops.&#160;The woman was tall and&#160;<br/>pretty. She had blond hair, shining eyes and a friendly&#160;smile. The baby&#160;in her&#160;arms squirmed in his blue&#160;<br/>blanket like&#160;Camp&#160;Half-Blood was the last place he&#160;wanted to be.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's an honor&#160;to have&#160;you&#160;here,&#34; Chiron&#160;told&#160;the&#160;woman, though&#160;he&#160;sounded&#160;nervous. &#34;It's been a long&#160;<br/>
time since&#160;a mortal was&#160;allowed at camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't encourage her,&#34; Hermes grumbled. &#34;May,&#160;you&#160;<i>can't&#160;</i>do this.&#34;&#160;<br/>
With a shock, I realized I&#160;was&#160;seeing May&#160;Castellan.&#160;She looked nothing like the old woman&#160;I'd&#160;met.&#160;<br/>
She seemed full of life—the kind of&#160;person who could&#160;smile and&#160;make everyone around&#160;her feel good.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, don't worry&#160;so much,&#34; May&#160;said,&#160;rocking the baby.&#160;&#34;You&#160;need an Oracle, don't&#160;you?&#160;The old&#160;<br/>
one's been dead for, what, twenty&#160;years?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Longer,&#34; Chiron said gravely.&#160;<br/>
Hermes raised his arms&#160;in exasperation. &#34;I&#160;didn't&#160;tell&#160;you that&#160;story&#160;so&#160;you&#160;could&#160;<i>apply.&#160;</i>It's&#160;dangerous.&#160;<br/>
Chiron, tell her.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It is,&#34; Chiron&#160;warned. &#34;For many&#160;years, I have&#160;forbidden anyone from&#160;trying.&#160;We don't know exactly&#160;<br/>
what's happened. Humanity seems to have&#160;lost the ability&#160;to&#160;host the Oracle.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We've been through that,&#34; May&#160;said.&#160;&#34;And I know&#160;I can do it. Hermes, this is&#160;my&#160;chance to do&#160;<br/>
something good. I've been given the gift&#160;of sight for a&#160;reason.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to yell at May&#160;Castellan to stop. I knew&#160;what was about to happen. I finally&#160;understood how&#160;<br/>
her life had been destroyed.&#160;But I couldn't&#160;move or speak.&#160;<br/>
Hermes looked&#160;more hurt than worried. &#34;You couldn't marry&#160;if&#160;you&#160;became&#160;the&#160;Oracle,&#34; he&#160;<br/>
complained. &#34;You couldn't&#160;see&#160;<i>me&#160;</i>anymore.&#34;&#160;<br/>
May&#160;put her&#160;hand on&#160;his&#160;arm.&#160;&#34;I can't&#160;have you&#160;forever, can I? You'll&#160;move on soon.&#160;You're&#160;<br/>
immortal.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He started to&#160;protest, but she put her hand on his&#160;chest. &#34;You know it's true! Don't try&#160;to spare&#160;my&#160;<br/>
feelings. Besides, we have&#160;a wonderful child. I can&#160;still raise Luke if I'm&#160;the&#160;Oracle, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron coughed. &#34;Yes, but in all fairness, I don't know&#160;how that&#160;will affect the&#160;spirit of the Oracle.&#160;A&#160;<br/>
woman who has already&#160;borne a child—as far as I know, this has never been done before.&#160;If the spirit&#160;<br/>does not take—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It will,&#34; May insisted.&#160;<br/>
<i>No,&#160;</i>I wanted to shout.&#160;<i>It won't.</i>&#160;<br/>
May&#160;Castellan kissed her baby&#160;and handed the&#160;bundle to Hermes. &#34;I'll be right back.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She gave them&#160;one last confident smile&#160;and climbed the steps.&#160;<br/>
Chiron and Hermes&#160;paced in&#160;silence. The baby&#160;squirmed.&#160;<br/>
A green glow lit the windows of the house. The campers stopped playing volleyball and stared up at&#160;<br/>
the attic. A cold wind rushed through the strawberry&#160;fields.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=123></a>Hermes&#160;must've felt it too.&#160;He cried, &#34;No!&#160;NO!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He shoved the baby into Chiron's arms and ran for&#160;the porch. Before he reached the door, the sunny&#160;<br/>
afternoon was shattered by May&#160;Castellan's terrified scream.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I got up&#160;so fast I banged my head on somebody's&#160;shield.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ow!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sorry, Percy.&#34; Annabeth&#160;was standing&#160;over me. &#34;I was just about to&#160;wake you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I rubbed&#160;my&#160;head, trying&#160;to&#160;clear the disturbing&#160;visions. Suddenly&#160;a lot of&#160;things&#160;made sense to me:&#160;<br/>
May&#160;Castellan had tried to&#160;become&#160;the Oracle. She&#160;hadn't known about Hades's&#160;curse preventing the spirit&#160;<br/>of Delphi from taking another host. Neither had Chiron&#160;or Hermes.&#160;They&#160;hadn't realized that by&#160;trying&#160;to&#160;<br/>take the job,&#160;May&#160;would be&#160;driven mad,&#160;plagued with&#160;fits in which her eyes would&#160;glow green and she&#160;<br/>would have shattered glimpses of her child's future.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy?&#34; Annabeth asked. &#34;What's wrong?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nothing,&#34; I lied. &#34;What . .&#160;. what are you doing in&#160;armor? You should&#160;be resting.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, I'm&#160;fine,&#34; she said, though she still looked pale. She was barely&#160;moving&#160;her right arm.&#160;&#34;That&#160;<br/>
nectar and ambrosia fixed me up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Uh-huh. You can't&#160;seriously&#160;go out and fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She offered&#160;me her good hand and helped&#160;me&#160;up. My&#160;head was pounding. Outside, the sky&#160;was purple&#160;<br/>
and red.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're going to&#160;need every&#160;person&#160;you have,&#34; she said. &#34;I just looked&#160;in&#160;my&#160;shield. There's an&#160;<br/>
army—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Heading south into Central Park,&#34; I said. &#34;Yeah, I know.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I told her&#160;part of my&#160;dreams. I left out the vision&#160;of May&#160;Castellan, because it was too disturbing to&#160;<br/>
talk about.&#160;I&#160;also left out&#160;Ethan's speculation about&#160;Luke fighting&#160;Kronos inside&#160;his body.&#160;I&#160;didn't want to&#160;<br/>get Annabeth's hopes up.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Do&#160;you&#160;think Ethan suspects about&#160;your&#160;weak spot?&#34;&#160;she asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know,&#34; I admitted.&#160;&#34;He didn't tell&#160;Kronos anything,&#160;but if&#160;he figures it out—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We can't let him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll bonk him&#160;on the head&#160;harder next time,&#34; I suggested. &#34;Any&#160;idea&#160;what surprise Kronos was talking&#160;<br/>
about?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She shook&#160;her head. &#34;I didn't&#160;see anything&#160;in the shield, but&#160;I don't like surprises.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Agreed.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So,&#34; she said,&#160;&#34;are you going to argue about me&#160;coming along?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=124></a>&#34;Nah. You'd just beat&#160;me&#160;up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She managed&#160;a laugh, which was good to&#160;hear. I grabbed my&#160;sword, and we went to rally&#160;the troops.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Thalia and the head counselors were waiting for&#160;us&#160;at&#160;the Reservoir. The&#160;lights of the city&#160;were blinking&#160;<br/>on at twilight. I guess a lot of them&#160;were on automatic&#160;timers. Streetlamps glowed around the&#160;shore of the&#160;<br/>lake,&#160;making the water and trees look even spookier.&#160;<br/>
&#34;They're coming,&#34; Thalia confirmed, pointing north with&#160;&#160;a silver arrow. &#34;One of&#160;my&#160;scouts just&#160;<br/>
reported they've crossed the Harlem&#160;River. There was no way&#160;to hold them back. The army&#160;. . .&#34; She&#160;<br/>shrugged. &#34;It's huge.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll hold them&#160;at the park,&#34; I said. &#34;Grover,&#160;you ready?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He nodded. &#34;As ready&#160;as we'll<i>&#160;</i>ever be. If&#160;my&#160;nature spirits can stop them&#160;anywhere, this is the place.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, we will!&#34; said another voice. A very&#160;old,&#160;fat satyr pushed through the crowd, stumbling&#160;over his&#160;<br/>
own spear. He was dressed&#160;in wood-bark armor that only&#160;covered half of his belly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Leneus?&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't act so surprised,&#34; he&#160;huffed. &#34;I&#160;<i>am&#160;</i>a leader of the Council,&#160;and&#160;you&#160;<i>did&#160;</i>tell me to find Grover.&#160;<br/>
Well, I found&#160;him,&#160;and I'm&#160;not going&#160;to let a&#160;mere&#160;<i>outcast&#160;</i>lead the satyrs without my&#160;help!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Behind Leneus's&#160;back, Grover&#160;made gagging motions,&#160;but the old&#160;satyr&#160;grinned&#160;like he was the savior&#160;<br/>
of the day.&#160;&#34;Never fear! We'll show those Titans!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't know&#160;whether to laugh or be angry,&#160;but I managed to keep a straight face. &#34;Um . . .&#160;yeah.&#160;<br/>
Well, Grover, you won't be alone. Annabeth and the Athena cabin will&#160;make their stand here. And&#160;me,&#160;<br/>and . . .&#160;Thalia?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She patted me on the shoulder. &#34;Say no&#160;more. The Hunters are ready.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked at the other counselors. &#34;That leaves the rest of you with a job just as important.&#160;You have to&#160;<br/>
guard the&#160;other entrances to Manhattan. You&#160;know&#160;how tricky&#160;Kronos is. He'll&#160;hope to distract us with&#160;<br/>this big&#160;army&#160;and sneak another force in&#160;somewhere else. It's&#160;up to&#160;you&#160;to make sure that doesn't&#160;happen.&#160;<br/>Has each cabin&#160;chosen a bridge or tunnel?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The counselors nodded&#160;grimly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then let's do it,&#34; I said. &#34;Good&#160;hunting,&#160;everybody!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
We heard the army&#160;before we saw it.&#160;<br/>
The noise was like a cannon barrage combined with a&#160;football stadium&#160;crowd—like every&#160;Patriots fan&#160;<br/>
in New England was charging us with&#160;bazookas.&#160;<br/>
At the north end of the reservoir, the enemy&#160;vanguard&#160;broke through the woods—a warrior in golden&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=125></a>armor leading a battalion&#160;of Laistrygonian giants&#160;with huge bronze axes. Hundreds of&#160;other monsters&#160;<br/>poured out behind them.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Positions!&#34; Annabeth yelled.&#160;<br/>
Her cabinmates scrambled.&#160;The idea was to make the enemy&#160;army&#160;break around&#160;the reservoir. To get&#160;<br/>
to us, they'd&#160;have to follow the trails, which meant&#160;they'd&#160;be marching in&#160;narrow columns&#160;on either side&#160;<br/>of the water.&#160;<br/>
At first, the plan seemed to&#160;work. The enemy&#160;divided<i>&#160;</i>and streamed toward us along the shore. When&#160;<br/>
they&#160;were halfway&#160;across, our defenses kicked in.&#160;The jogging&#160;trail erupted in Greek fire, incinerating&#160;<br/>many&#160;of&#160;the&#160;monsters instantly. Others flailed around, engulfed in green flames. Athena campers threw&#160;<br/>grappling&#160;hooks around the largest giants and pulled&#160;them&#160;to the ground.&#160;<br/>
In the woods on the right, the Hunters&#160;sent a volley&#160;of silver arrows into the enemy&#160;line, destroying&#160;<br/>
twenty&#160;or thirty&#160;<i>dracaenae,&#160;</i>but more&#160;marched behind them. A bolt of lightning crackled out of the sky&#160;<br/>and fried a Laistrygonian&#160;giant to ashes, and I knew Thalia&#160;must be doing&#160;her&#160;<i>daughter of Zeus&#160;</i>thing.&#160;<br/>
Grover raised his&#160;pipes and played&#160;a&#160;quick tune.&#160;A roar went up from&#160;the&#160;woods on&#160;both sides as&#160;<br/>
every&#160;tree, rock, and bush seemed to&#160;sprout a spirit. Dryads and satyrs raised their clubs and charged. The&#160;<br/>trees wrapped around the&#160;monsters, strangling them. Grass grew around the feet of the enemy&#160;archers.&#160;<br/>Stones flew up and hit&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;</i>in the faces.&#160;<br/>
The enemy&#160;slogged forward. Giants smashed through&#160;the trees, and&#160;naiads faded&#160;as their life sources&#160;<br/>
were destroyed. Hellhounds lunged at&#160;the timber wolves, knocking them&#160;aside. Enemy&#160;archers returned&#160;<br/>fire, and a Hunter fell from&#160;a high branch.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; Annabeth grabbed&#160;my&#160;arm&#160;and pointed at&#160;the reservoir. The Titan in&#160;the gold armor wasn't&#160;<br/>
waiting for his forces to advance around the sides. He&#160;was charging&#160;toward us,&#160;walking straight over the&#160;<br/>top of the lake.&#160;<br/>
A Greek firebomb exploded right on top of him,&#160;but he&#160;raised his&#160;palm&#160;and sucked the flames out of&#160;<br/>
the air.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hyperion,&#34;&#160;Annabeth said in awe. &#34;The&#160;lord of light. Titan of the&#160;east.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bad?&#34;&#160;I guessed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Next to Atlas, he's&#160;the greatest Titan warrior. In&#160;the&#160;old days, four&#160;Titans controlled the four&#160;corners&#160;<br/>
of the world.&#160;Hyperion was the east—the&#160;most powerful.&#160;He was the father of Helios, the first&#160;sun god.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll keep him busy,&#34; I&#160;promised.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, even&#160;you can't—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just keep our forces together.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We'd&#160;set up&#160;at the reservoir for good reason. I concentrated on the water and felt its power&#160;surging&#160;<br/>
through me.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=126></a>I advanced toward Hyperion, running&#160;over the top of the water.&#160;<i>Yeah, buddy. Two can play that game.</i>&#160;<br/>
Twenty&#160;feet away, Hyperion raised his sword. His eyes were just like I'd seen in my&#160;dream—as gold&#160;<br/>
as Kronos's but brighter, like miniature&#160;suns.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The sea god's brat,&#34; he mused. &#34;You're the one&#160;who trapped Atlas beneath the sky again?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It wasn't&#160;hard,&#34; I said. &#34;You Titans are about as bright as&#160;my&#160;gym&#160;socks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hyperion&#160;snarled. &#34;You want bright?&#34;&#160;<br/>
His body&#160;ignited in a column&#160;of light and heat. I looked away, but&#160;I was still blinded.&#160;<br/>
Instinctively&#160;I raised Riptide—just in time.&#160;Hyperion's&#160;blade&#160;slammed against&#160;mine. The&#160;shock wave&#160;<br/>
sent a ten-foot ring of water across the surface of the lake.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;eyes still&#160;burned. I&#160;had&#160;to shut off&#160;his&#160;light.&#160;<br/>
I concentrated&#160;on the tidal&#160;wave and forced it to reverse. Just&#160;before impact, I jumped upward on a jet&#160;<br/>
of water.&#160;<br/>
&#34;AHHHHH!&#34;&#160;The waves smashed&#160;into Hyperion and he&#160;went under, his light&#160;extinguished.&#160;<br/>
I landed on the lake's surface just as&#160;Hyperion struggled to his feet. His golden armor was&#160;dripping&#160;<br/>
wet. His eyes no longer blazed, but they&#160;still looked murderous.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You will burn, Jackson!&#34;&#160;he roared.&#160;<br/>
Our swords met again and the air charged with ozone.&#160;<br/>
The battle still raged around us. On the right flank, Annabeth was leading an assault with her&#160;siblings.&#160;<br/>
On the left flank, Grover and his nature spirits were regrouping, entangling the enemies&#160;with bushes and&#160;<br/>weeds.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Enough games,&#34; Hyperion&#160;told me. &#34;We fight on&#160;land.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was about&#160;to make some clever comment, like &#34;No,&#34;&#160;when&#160;the&#160;Titan&#160;yelled.&#160;A wall&#160;of&#160;force&#160;<br/>
slammed&#160;me through the air—just like the trick Kronos had pulled on the bridge. I sailed backward about&#160;<br/>three hundred&#160;yards and smashed into the ground. If&#160;it hadn't been for my&#160;new invulnerability, I would've&#160;<br/>broken every&#160;bone in my<i>&#160;</i>body.&#160;<br/>
I got to&#160;my&#160;feet, groaning.&#160;&#34;I really&#160;<i>hate&#160;</i>it when&#160;you Titans do that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hyperion&#160;closed on me&#160;with blinding&#160;speed.&#160;<br/>
I concentrated on the water, drawing strength from&#160;it.&#160;<br/>
Hyperion&#160;attacked. He was powerful and fast, but&#160;he couldn't seem&#160;to land a blow. The ground&#160;around&#160;<br/>
his feet kept erupting&#160;in flames, but I kept dousing it&#160;just as quickly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Stop it!&#34;&#160;the&#160;Titan roared. &#34;Stop that wind!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wasn't sure&#160;what he&#160;meant. I was too busy&#160;fighting.&#160;<br/>
Hyperion stumbled like he was being pushed away.&#160;Water sprayed his face, stinging his eyes. The&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=127></a>wind picked&#160;up, and Hyperion staggered backward.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; Grover called in amazement. &#34;How are you&#160;<i>doing&#160;</i>that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Doing what?&#160;I thought.&#160;<br/>
Then I looked down, and&#160;I realized I&#160;was standing in the&#160;middle of&#160;my&#160;own personal hurricane.&#160;<br/>
Clouds of&#160;water vapor swirled around&#160;me, winds so&#160;powerful they&#160;buffeted Hyperion and flattened the&#160;<br/>grass in a twenty-yard radius. Enemy&#160;warriors threw&#160;javelins at&#160;me, but the storm&#160;knocked them&#160;aside.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sweet,&#34; I&#160;muttered. &#34;But&#160;a little&#160;more!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Lightning flickered around me. The clouds darkened&#160;and the rain swirled faster. I closed in&#160;on&#160;<br/>
Hyperion&#160;and&#160;blew him&#160;off his feet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; Grover called again. &#34;Bring&#160;him&#160;over here!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I slashed and jabbed, letting my&#160;reflexes take over,&#160;Hyperion&#160;could barely&#160;defend himself.&#160;His&#160;eyes&#160;<br/>
kept trying&#160;to&#160;ignite, but the hurricane quenched his flames.&#160;<br/>
I couldn't keep up a storm&#160;like this forever, though. I&#160;could feel&#160;my&#160;powers weakening. With&#160;one last&#160;<br/>
effort, I propelled Hyperion&#160;across the field, straight to&#160;where Grover was waiting.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will not&#160;be toyed with!&#34;&#160;Hyperion bellowed.&#160;<br/>
He&#160;managed&#160;to get to&#160;his&#160;feet again, but Grover put&#160;his reed<i>&#160;&#160;</i>pipes to his lips&#160;and began&#160;to play.&#160;<br/>
Leneus joined him.&#160;Around the grove, every&#160;satyr&#160;took&#160;up the song—an eerie&#160;melody,&#160;like a creek&#160;<br/>flowing over stones. The ground erupted&#160;at Hyperion's&#160;feet. Gnarled&#160;roots wrapped around&#160;his legs.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's this?&#34; he protested. He tried to&#160;shake off&#160;the roots, but he was&#160;still weak. The roots thickened&#160;<br/>
until he looked like he was wearing wooden boots.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Stop this!&#34; he&#160;shouted. &#34;Your woodland&#160;magic is no match for a Titan!&#34;&#160;<br/>
But the more he struggled,&#160;the faster the roots&#160;grew. They&#160;curled about&#160;his&#160;body, thickening&#160;and&#160;<br/>
hardening into&#160;bark. His golden armor&#160;melted into the wood, becoming part of&#160;a large trunk.&#160;<br/>
The music continued. Hyperion's forces&#160;backed up&#160;in astonishment as their leader was absorbed. He&#160;<br/>
stretched out&#160;his arms and&#160;they&#160;became&#160;branches, from which&#160;smaller branches&#160;shot out and grew leaves.&#160;<br/>The tree grew taller and thicker, until only the Titan's face was visible in the middle of the trunk.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You cannot imprison me!&#34; he bellowed. &#34;I am&#160;Hyperion! I am—&#34;&#160;<br/>
The bark closed over his face.&#160;<br/>
Grover took&#160;his pipes from&#160;his&#160;mouth. &#34;You are a very&#160;nice maple tree.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Several of the other satyrs passed out from&#160;exhaustion,&#160;but they'd&#160;done their job well. The Titan lord&#160;<br/>
was completely&#160;encased in an enormous maple. The&#160;trunk was at least twenty feet in diameter, with&#160;<br/>branches as tall as any&#160;in the park. The&#160;tree&#160;might've&#160;stood there for centuries.&#160;<br/>
The Titan's army&#160;started to retreat.&#160;A cheer went up from the Athena&#160;cabin, but our victory&#160;was short-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=128></a>lived.&#160;<br/>
Because just then Kronos&#160;unleashed his surprise.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;REEEEET!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
The squeal echoed through&#160;upper Manhattan. Demigods and monsters alike froze in terror.&#160;<br/>
Grover shot&#160;me a panicked look. &#34;Why&#160;does that sound like .&#160;. . It&#160;can't be!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I knew what&#160;he was thinking. Two&#160;years ago we'd&#160;gotten a &#34;gift&#34; from&#160;Pan—a&#160;huge boar that&#160;carried&#160;<br/>
us across the&#160;Southwest (after it tried to&#160;kill us). The boar had a similar squeal, but what we&#160;were hearing&#160;<br/>now seemed higher pitched, shriller, almost like&#160;. . .&#160;like if the boar had an angry girlfriend.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;REEEEEET!&#34;</i>&#160;A<i>&#160;</i>huge&#160;pink creature soared over the reservoir—a Macy's&#160;Thanksgiving Day Parade&#160;<br/>
nightmare blimp with wings.&#160;<br/>
&#34;A sow!&#34; Annabeth cried. &#34;Take cover!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The demigods scattered as the winged lady pig&#160;swooped down. Her wings were pink like a&#160;<br/>
flamingo's, which matched her skin&#160;beautifully,&#160;but it&#160;was hard to&#160;think of&#160;her&#160;as&#160;<i>cute&#160;</i>when her hooves&#160;<br/>slammed into the ground,&#160;barely&#160;missing one of Annabeth's&#160;siblings. The pig stomped&#160;around and tore&#160;<br/>down half<i>&#160;</i>an&#160;acre of trees, belching a&#160;cloud of&#160;noxious gas. Then&#160;it took off&#160;again, circling around&#160;for&#160;<br/>another strike.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't tell&#160;me that thing is&#160;from&#160;Greek&#160;mythology,&#34; I&#160;complained.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Afraid so,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;The Clazmonian Sow.&#160;It terrorized Greek towns&#160;back in the day.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Let&#160;me&#160;guess,&#34; I said. &#34;Hercules beat it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nope,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;As far as I know,&#160;<i>no&#160;</i>hero has ever beaten&#160;it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Perfect,&#34; I&#160;muttered.&#160;<br/>
The Titan's army&#160;was recovering from&#160;its&#160;shock. I&#160;guess they&#160;realized the pig wasn't after them.&#160;<br/>
We only&#160;had&#160;seconds before they&#160;were ready&#160;to fight, and our forces were&#160;still in&#160;a panic. Every&#160;time&#160;<br/>
the sow belched, Grover's&#160;nature spirits&#160;yelped and faded back into their trees.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That pig has to go.&#34; I grabbed a grappling hook from one&#160;of Annabeth's&#160;siblings. &#34;I'll take care of it.&#160;<br/>
You guys&#160;hold the rest of the enemy.&#160;Push them&#160;back!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But, Percy,&#34;&#160;Grover said, &#34;what if we can't?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I saw how tired he was. The&#160;magic had&#160;really&#160;drained him.&#160;Annabeth didn't look much better from&#160;<br/>
fighting with&#160;a bad shoulder wound. I didn't know how the Hunters were doing,&#160;but the right&#160;flank of the&#160;<br/>enemy&#160;army&#160;was now between them&#160;and us.&#160;<br/>
I didn't want to leave&#160;my&#160;friends in such bad shape,&#160;but that sow was the biggest threat.&#160;It would&#160;<br/>
destroy&#160;everything:&#160;buildings, trees, sleeping mortals. It had to&#160;be stopped.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=129></a>&#34;Retreat if you need to,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Just slow them&#160;down. I'll be back as soon as I can.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Before I could change my&#160;mind, I swung the grappling hook like&#160;a lasso. When the sow came down&#160;<br/>
for its next&#160;pass, I threw with all my&#160;strength. The&#160;hook wrapped around the&#160;base of the pig's wing. It&#160;<br/>squealed in rage and veered off,&#160;yanking&#160;the rope and&#160;me into the sky.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
If you're heading&#160;downtown from&#160;Central Park, my&#160;advice&#160;is to take the subway. Flying&#160;pigs are faster,&#160;<br/>but way more dangerous.&#160;<br/>
The sow soared past the Plaza<i>&#160;</i>Hotel, straight into the&#160;canyon of Fifth Avenue. My&#160;brilliant plan was&#160;<br/>
to climb the rope and get&#160;on the pig's back. Unfortunately I was too busy&#160;swinging around dodging&#160;<br/>streetlamps and the sides of buildings.&#160;<br/>
Another thing I learned: it's&#160;one thing&#160;to&#160;climb a rope&#160;in gym&#160;class. It's a completely&#160;different thing to&#160;<br/>
climb a rope attached to a moving pig's wing while&#160;you're flying&#160;at a hundred miles an hour.&#160;<br/>
We zigzagged along several blocks and&#160;continued south on Park&#160;Avenue.&#160;<br/>
<i>Boss!&#160;Hey, boss!&#160;</i>Out&#160;of the corner of my eye, I saw Blackjack speeding along&#160;next to&#160;us, darting back&#160;<br/>
and forth to&#160;avoid the pig's wings.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Watch out!&#34;&#160;I told him.&#160;<br/>
<i>Hop on!&#160;</i>Blackjack whinnied. &#160;<i>I can catch you . . .&#160;probably.</i>&#160;<br/>
That wasn't&#160;very&#160;reassuring. Grand Central lay dead&#160;ahead. Above the main entrance stood the giant&#160;<br/>
statue of Hermes, which I&#160;guess hadn't&#160;been activated&#160;because it was so high up. I was flying right toward&#160;<br/>him&#160;at the speed of demigod-smashing.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Stay&#160;alert!&#34; I&#160;told Blackjack. &#34;I've got an idea.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Oh, I hate your ideas.</i>&#160;<br/>
I swung outward with all my&#160;might. Instead of smashing into the&#160;Hermes statue, I whipped&#160;around it,&#160;<br/>
circling the rope under its&#160;arms. I thought this would&#160;tether the pig,&#160;but I'd underestimated the momentum&#160;<br/>of a thirty-ton sow in flight. Just&#160;as the&#160;pig wrenched the statue loose from its&#160;pedestal, I let go. Hermes&#160;<br/>went for a ride, taking my&#160;place as the pig's passenger,&#160;and I free-fell toward the&#160;street.&#160;<br/>
In that split second I thought about&#160;the&#160;days&#160;when&#160;my&#160;mom&#160;used to work at the&#160;Grand Central candy&#160;<br/>
shop. I thought how bad&#160;it&#160;would be if&#160;I&#160;ended up as a grease spot on the pavement.&#160;<br/>
Then a shadow swooped under&#160;me,&#160;and&#160;<i>thump</i>—I was&#160;on Blackjack's back. It wasn't&#160;the&#160;most&#160;<br/>
comfortable landing. In fact, when I&#160;yelled &#34;OW!&#34;<i>&#160;</i>my&#160;voice was an&#160;octave higher than usual.&#160;<br/>
<i>Sorry, boss,&#160;</i>Blackjack murmured.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No problem,&#34; I squeaked.&#160;&#34;Follow that&#160;pig!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The porker had taken a right at East 42nd and was flying back toward Fifth Avenue. When it flew&#160;<br/>
above the rooftops, I could see fires here&#160;and there around the city. It looked like&#160;my&#160;friends&#160;were having&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=130></a>a rough time. Kronos was attacking on several fronts. But at the moment, I had&#160;&#160;&#160;my&#160;own problems.&#160;<br/>
The Hermes&#160;statue was still on its leash. It kept&#160;bonking into&#160;buildings and spinning around.&#160;The pig&#160;<br/>
swooped over an office building, and Hermes plowed&#160;into a water tower on the roof, blasting water and&#160;<br/>wood everywhere.&#160;<br/>
Then something occurred to me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Get closer,&#34;&#160;I told Blackjack.&#160;<br/>
He whinnied in protest.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just within shouting distance,&#34; I said. &#34;I need to talk&#160;to the statue.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Now I'm sure&#160;you've lost it, boss,&#160;</i>Blackjack said, but he did what I asked. When I was&#160;close&#160;enough to&#160;<br/>
see the&#160;statue's&#160;face clearly, I&#160;yelled, &#34;Hello, Hermes! Command sequence: Daedalus Twenty-three. Kill&#160;<br/>Flying Pigs!&#160;Begin Activation!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Immediately&#160;the statue&#160;moved its legs. It seemed&#160;confused to find that it was no longer on top of&#160;<br/>
Grand Central Terminal. It was, instead, being&#160;given&#160;a sky-ride on&#160;the end&#160;of a rope by&#160;a large winged&#160;<br/>sow. It smashed through the side of&#160;a brick building, which I think&#160;made it a little&#160;mad. It shook its head&#160;<br/>and began to&#160;climb the rope.&#160;<br/>
I glanced down at the street. We&#160;were&#160;coming up on&#160;the&#160;main public library, with the big&#160;marble lions&#160;<br/>
flanking the steps. Suddenly&#160;I&#160;had a weird thought: Could&#160;<i>stone&#160;</i>statues be automatons too?&#160;It&#160;seemed like&#160;<br/>a long shot, but . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;Faster!&#34; I told Blackjack. &#34;Get in front&#160;of the pig, Taunt him!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Um, boss</i>—&#160;<br/>
&#34;Trust me,&#34; I said. &#34;I can do this . .&#160;. probably.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Oh, sure. Mock the horse.</i>&#160;<br/>
Blackjack burst through the air. He could fly&#160;pretty&#160;darned fast when he wanted to. He got&#160;in&#160;front&#160;of&#160;<br/>
the pig, which now had a&#160;metal Hermes on its back.&#160;<br/>
Blackjack whinnied,&#160;<i>You&#160;smell like ham!&#160;</i>He kicked&#160;the&#160;pig&#160;in&#160;the snout&#160;with his&#160;back hooves and&#160;<br/>
went into a steep dive<i>.&#160;</i>The pig screamed&#160;in rage and followed.&#160;<br/>
We barreled straight for the front steps&#160;of the library. Blackjack slowed down just enough for me to&#160;<br/>
hop&#160;off, then&#160;he kept flying&#160;toward the main doors.&#160;<br/>
I yelled out,&#160;&#34;Lions! Command sequence: Daedalus Twenty-three. Kill&#160;Flying Pigs! Begin&#160;<br/>
Activation!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The lions stood up and looked at&#160;me.&#160;They&#160;probably&#160;thought I was teasing them. But just then:&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;REEEEEET!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
The&#160;massive&#160;pink pork monster landed&#160;with a thud, cracking the&#160;sidewalk. The lions stared at it, not&#160;<br/>
believing their luck, and pounced. At&#160;the same time,&#160;a very&#160;beat-up Hermes&#160;statue leaped onto the pig's&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=131></a>head and started banging it&#160;mercilessly&#160;with a&#160;caduceus. Those lions&#160;had some&#160;nasty&#160;claws.&#160;<br/>
I drew Riptide, but there wasn't&#160;much for&#160;me&#160;to do.&#160;The pig disintegrated before my&#160;eyes. I almost felt&#160;<br/>
sorry&#160;for it. I&#160;hoped it&#160;got to&#160;meet the boar of its dreams down in Tartarus.&#160;<br/>
When the monster had completely&#160;turned to dust, the lions and the Hermes statue looked around&#160;in&#160;<br/>
confusion.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can defend Manhattan now,&#34; I&#160;told them, but they&#160;didn't&#160;seem&#160;to hear. They&#160;went&#160;charging&#160;<br/>
down Park Avenue, and I&#160;imagined they would keep&#160;looking for flying pigs&#160;until someone deactivated&#160;<br/>them.&#160;<br/>
<i>Hey, boss,&#160;</i>said Blackjack.&#160;<i>Can we take a donut break?</i>&#160;<br/>
I wiped the sweat off&#160;my&#160;brow. &#34;I wish,&#160;big guy,&#160;but the fight's&#160;still going on.&#34;&#160;<br/>
In fact, I could hear it&#160;getting closer. My&#160;friends needed help.&#160;I jumped on Blackjack, and&#160;we flew&#160;<br/>
north toward the sound&#160;of&#160;explosions.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
FIFTEEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
CHIRON &#160;THROWS&#160; A&#160;<br/>
PARTY&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Midtown was a war zone. We flew over little skirmishes everywhere. A giant was ripping up trees in&#160;<br/>Bryant Park&#160;while dryads&#160;pelted him&#160;with nuts.&#160;Outside the Waldorf Astoria, a bronze statue of Benjamin&#160;<br/>Franklin was whacking a&#160;hellhound with a rolled-up&#160;newspaper.&#160;A trio of Hephaestus campers fought a&#160;<br/>squad of&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;</i>in the&#160;middle of Rockefeller Center.&#160;<br/>
I was tempted to stop and help, but I could tell from&#160;the smoke&#160;and noise that the real action had&#160;<br/>
moved farther south. Our defenses were collapsing.&#160;The enemy&#160;was closing in&#160;on&#160;the Empire&#160;State&#160;<br/>Building.&#160;<br/>
We did a&#160;quick sweep of the surrounding area. The&#160;Hunters had&#160;set up a defensive line on&#160;37th,&#160;just&#160;<br/>
three blocks north of Olympus. To the&#160;east on Park Avenue, Jake Mason and some&#160;other Hephaestus&#160;<br/>campers were&#160;leading an army&#160;of statues&#160;against the enemy.&#160;To the&#160;west, the Demeter&#160;cabin and Grover's&#160;<br/>nature spirits had turned&#160;Sixth Avenue into a&#160;jungle that was hampering a squadron&#160;of Kronos's&#160;<br/>demigods. The south was clear for now,&#160;but the flanks&#160;of the enemy army&#160;were&#160;swinging around. A few&#160;<br/>more&#160;minutes and we'd&#160;be totally&#160;surrounded.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to land where they&#160;need&#160;us most,&#34; I muttered.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=132></a><i>That's&#160;everywhere, boss.</i>&#160;<br/>
I spotted a familiar silver owl banner in the southeast corner of the fight, 33rd at the Park Avenue&#160;<br/>
tunnel. Annabeth and two&#160;of her siblings&#160;were holding back a Hyperborean giant.&#160;<br/>
&#34;There!&#34; I told&#160;Blackjack. He plunged toward the battle.&#160;<br/>
I leaped off his back and landed on the giant's head. When the&#160;giant looked&#160;up, I slid off&#160;his face,&#160;<br/>
shield-bashing his nose on&#160;the way&#160;down.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;RAWWWR!'&#160;</i>The<i>&#160;</i>giant staggered backward, blue blood trickling&#160;from&#160;his nostrils.&#160;<br/>
I hit the&#160;pavement running. The Hyperborean breathed a cloud&#160;of white mist, and the temperature&#160;<br/>
dropped. The spot where&#160;I'd landed was now coated with ice,<i>&#160;&#160;</i>and I was covered in frost&#160;like a sugar&#160;<br/>donut.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, ugly!&#34;&#160;Annabeth&#160;yelled. I hoped she was talking to the&#160;giant,&#160;not me.&#160;<br/>
Blue Boy&#160;bellowed and turned toward her, exposing&#160;the unprotected back of his legs. I charged and&#160;<br/>
stabbed him&#160;behind the knee.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;WAAAAH!&#34;&#160;&#160;</i>The Hyperborean buckled. I waited for him&#160;to turn, but he froze. I&#160;mean he&#160;<i>literally&#160;</i><br/>
turned to solid ice.<i>&#160;</i>From&#160;the point where I'd stabbed&#160;him,&#160;cracks&#160;appeared in his body.&#160;They&#160;got larger&#160;<br/>and wider until the giant crumbled in a mountain of blue shards.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks.&#34; Annabeth winced,<i>&#160;</i>trying&#160;to&#160;catch her breath. &#34;The pig?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Pork chops,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good.&#34;&#160;She&#160;flexed her shoulder.&#160;Obviously, the&#160;wound was still bothering&#160;her, but&#160;she&#160;saw&#160;my&#160;<br/>
expression and rolled her eyes. &#34;I'm&#160;fine, Percy.&#160;Come&#160;on! We've got plenty of enemies left.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
She was right. The next hour was&#160;a blur. I fought like&#160;I'd never&#160;fought before—wading into legions of&#160;<br/>
<i>dracaenae,&#160;&#160;</i>taking out dozens of telkhines with every&#160;strike, destroying&#160;<i>empousai&#160;&#160;</i>and knocking&#160;out&#160;<br/>enemy&#160;demigods. No matter how many&#160;I defeated,&#160;more took their&#160;place.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and I raced from block to&#160;block, trying to&#160;shore up our defenses. Too&#160;many&#160;of our friends&#160;<br/>
lay&#160;wounded&#160;in the streets. Too many&#160;were&#160;missing.&#160;<br/>
As the night&#160;wore on and&#160;the moon got higher, we were backed up foot&#160;by&#160;foot until we were only&#160;a&#160;<br/>
block from&#160;the Empire State Building&#160;in any&#160;direction. At&#160;one point Grover&#160;was next to&#160;me, bonking&#160;<br/>snake women over the head&#160;with his cudgel. Then he&#160;disappeared in the crowd,&#160;and it was&#160;Thalia at&#160;my&#160;<br/>side, driving&#160;the monsters back with&#160;the power of<i>&#160;&#160;</i>her magic shield. Mrs.&#160;O'Leary&#160;bounded out of&#160;<br/>nowhere, picked up a Laistrygonian giant in her&#160;mouth, and flung him&#160;into the air like a Frisbee.&#160;<br/>Annabeth used her invisibility cap to sneak behind&#160;the enemy&#160;lines. Whenever a&#160;monster disintegrated for&#160;<br/>no apparent reason with a surprised look on&#160;his face, I knew Annabeth had been there.&#160;<br/>
But it still wasn't&#160;enough.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=133></a>&#34;Hold&#160;your lines!&#34; Katie Gardner shouted, somewhere off to my&#160;left.&#160;<br/>
The problem&#160;was there&#160;were too few of us&#160;to hold&#160;anything. The entrance to Olympus was twenty feet&#160;<br/>
behind me. A ring of&#160;brave demigods, Hunters, and nature spirits guarded the doors. I slashed and hacked,&#160;<br/>destroying everything m&#160;my path,&#160;but even I was getting tired, and&#160;I couldn't be&#160;everywhere at once.&#160;<br/>
Behind the enemy&#160;troops,&#160;a few blocks&#160;to the east, a&#160;bright light began to shine. I thought it&#160;was the&#160;<br/>
sunrise. Then&#160;I realized Kronos was riding toward us&#160;on&#160;a golden&#160;chariot. A dozen Laistrygonian giants&#160;<br/>bore torches before him.&#160;Two Hyperboreans carried his black-and-purple banners. The Titan&#160;lord looked&#160;<br/>fresh and rested, his powers at full strength. He was taking his time advancing,&#160;letting me wear&#160;myself&#160;<br/>down.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth appeared next to me. &#34;We have to fall back to the doorway. Hold it at all costs!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She was right. I was about to order a retreat when I heard the hunting horn.&#160;<br/>
It cut through the noise of&#160;the battle like&#160;a fire alarm.&#160;A chorus of horns answered from&#160;all around&#160;us,&#160;<br/>
echoing off the buildings&#160;of Manhattan.&#160;<br/>
I glanced at Thalia, but she&#160;just frowned.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not the Hunters,&#34; she assured me. &#34;We're&#160;all here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then who?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The horns got&#160;louder. I&#160;couldn't tell where they were coming from&#160;because of the echo, but it&#160;sounded&#160;<br/>
like an entire army&#160;was approaching.&#160;<br/>
I was afraid it might be more&#160;enemies,&#160;but&#160;Kronos's&#160;forces&#160;looked&#160;as&#160;confused as we were. Giants&#160;<br/>
lowered their clubs.&#160;<i>Dracaenae&#160;</i>hissed. Even Kronos's&#160;honor&#160;guard looked&#160;uneasy.&#160;<br/>
Then, to our left, a hundred&#160;monsters cried out at&#160;once. Kronos's entire northern&#160;flank surged forward.&#160;<br/>
I thought we were doomed,&#160;but they&#160;didn't&#160;attack. They&#160;ran straight past us and&#160;crashed into their southern&#160;<br/>allies.&#160;<br/>
A new blast of horns shattered the night.&#160;The air shimmered. In a blur of movement, an entire&#160;cavalry&#160;<br/>
appeared as if dropping&#160;out&#160;of light&#160;speed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah, baby!&#34;&#160;a voice<i>&#160;</i>wailed. &#34;PARTY!&#34;&#160;<br/>
A shower of arrows arced over&#160;our&#160;heads and slammed into the enemy,&#160;vaporizing&#160;hundreds of&#160;<br/>
demons. But these weren't regular arrows. They made whizzy sounds as they&#160;flew, like&#160;<i>WHEEEEEE!&#160;<br/></i>Some had pinwheels attached to them. Others had boxing gloves rather than points.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Centaurs!&#34; Annabeth&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
The Party&#160;Pony&#160;army&#160;exploded into&#160;our&#160;midst in a riot of colors: tie-dyed<i>&#160;</i>shirts, rainbow Afro wigs,&#160;<br/>
oversize sunglasses, and war-painted faces. Some&#160;had slogans scrawled across their flanks like&#160;<i>HORSEZ&#160;</i><br/>
<i>PWN&#160;</i>or&#160;<i>KRONOS SUX.</i>&#160;<br/>
Hundreds of&#160;them&#160;filled the entire block. My&#160;brain couldn't process everything I&#160;saw, but I&#160;knew if&#160;I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=134></a>were the enemy,&#160;I'd be running.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; Chiron shouted across the sea&#160;of wild centaurs. He was dressed in armor from&#160;the&#160;waist up,&#160;<br/>
his bow in&#160;his hand, and&#160;he&#160;was grinning&#160;in satisfaction. &#34;Sorry&#160;we're late!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;DUDE!&#34; Another centaur yelled.&#160;&#34;Talk&#160;later. WASTE MONSTERS NOW!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He locked and loaded a&#160;double-barrel&#160;paint gun and blasted an&#160;enemy&#160;hellhound&#160;bright&#160;pink. The&#160;<br/>
paint&#160;must've been&#160;mixed&#160;with Celestial bronze dust or something, because&#160;as soon as it&#160;splattered the&#160;<br/>hellhound, the&#160;monster yelped and dissolved into&#160;a pink-and-black&#160;puddle.&#160;<br/>
&#34;PARTY PONIES.'&#34; a centaur yelled. &#34;SOUTH FLORIDA!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Somewhere&#160;across the battlefield, a twangy&#160;voice yelled back, &#34;HEART OF TEXAS CHAPTER!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;HAWAII OWNS YOUR FACES!&#34; a third one shouted.&#160;<br/>
It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. The entire Titan army&#160;turned and fled, pushed back by&#160;a&#160;<br/>
flood&#160;of paintballs, arrows, swords, and NERF baseball bats. The centaurs trampled everything in their&#160;<br/>path.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Stop running,&#160;you fools!&#34; Kronos&#160;yelled.<i>&#160;</i>&#34;Stand and ACKK!&#34;&#160;<br/>
That last part was because&#160;a panicked&#160;Hyperborean&#160;giant stumbled&#160;backward and sat on top of him.&#160;<br/>
The lord of&#160;time disappeared under a giant blue butt.&#160;<br/>
We pushed them&#160;for several blocks&#160;until Chiron yelled,&#160;&#34;HOLD!&#160;On&#160;your promise,&#160;HOLD!&#34;&#160;<br/>
It wasn't easy, but eventually&#160;the order got relayed up and&#160;down the ranks&#160;of centaurs, and they&#160;<br/>
started to pull back, letting&#160;the enemy&#160;flee.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Chiron's smart,&#34; Annabeth said, wiping the sweat&#160;off her face. &#34;If we pursue, we'll get too spread&#160;<br/>
out. We need&#160;to regroup.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But the enemy—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;They're not&#160;defeated,&#34; she agreed.<i>&#160;</i>&#34;But the dawn is coming. At least we've bought some&#160;time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't like&#160;pulling back, but I knew&#160;she was right.&#160;I watched as the last of&#160;the telkhines scuttled&#160;<br/>
toward the East River. Then reluctantly&#160;I turned and&#160;headed back&#160;toward the Empire State Building.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
We set up a two-block perimeter,&#160;with a command tent&#160;at the Empire State Building. Chiron informed us&#160;<br/>that the Party Ponies had sent chapters from&#160;almost every state in&#160;the Union: forty from&#160;California, two&#160;<br/>from Rhode Island, thirty&#160;from Illinois . . . Roughly five hundred total had answered his call, but even&#160;<br/>with that many, we couldn't defend more than a few blocks.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dude,&#34; said a centaur named Larry.&#160;His T-shirt identified him as&#160;<i>BIG CHIEF UBER GUY,&#160;NEW&#160;</i><br/>
<i>MEXICO&#160;CHAPTER.&#160;</i>&#34;That&#160;was&#160;more fun than our&#160;last convention&#160;in&#160;Vegas!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#34; said&#160;Owen from South Dakota. He wore&#160;a black leather jacket&#160;and an old WWII army&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=135></a>helmet. &#34;We totally&#160;wasted them!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron patted Owen on the back. &#34;You did well,&#160;my&#160;friends, but&#160;don't get careless.&#160;Kronos should&#160;<br/>
never be underestimated. Now why don't you visit&#160;the&#160;diner on&#160;West 33rd and get some&#160;breakfast? I hear&#160;<br/>the Delaware&#160;chapter found&#160;a stash of root beer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Root beer!&#34;&#160;They&#160;almost trampled each other as they galloped off.&#160;<br/>
Chiron smiled. Annabeth&#160;gave him&#160;a big&#160;hug, and Mrs. O'Leary&#160;licked his face.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ack,&#34; he grumbled. &#34;Enough of that, dog. Yes, I'm glad to see you&#160;too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Chiron, thanks,&#34; I said. &#34;Talk about saving the day.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He shrugged.&#160;&#34;I'm&#160;sorry&#160;it&#160;took so&#160;long.&#160;Centaurs travel fast, as you know. We&#160;can bend&#160;distance as&#160;<br/>
we ride. Even so, getting&#160;all the centaurs together&#160;was no easy&#160;task. The Party Ponies are not exactly&#160;<br/>organized.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;How'd&#160;you&#160;get through the&#160;magic defenses around the&#160;city?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;They slowed us down a&#160;bit,&#34; Chiron&#160;admitted, &#34;but I think they're intended mostly&#160;to&#160;keep mortals&#160;<br/>
out. Kronos doesn't&#160;want puny&#160;humans&#160;getting in&#160;the&#160;way&#160;of&#160;his great victory.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So maybe other reinforcements can get through,&#34; I said hopefully.&#160;<br/>
Chiron stroked his beard. &#34;Perhaps, though time is&#160;short. As soon&#160;as&#160;Kronos regroups, he will attack&#160;<br/>
again. Without the element of surprise on our side .&#160;. .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I understood&#160;what he&#160;meant. Kronos wasn't&#160;beaten.&#160;Not by&#160;a long&#160;shot. I half&#160;hoped Kronos&#160;had been&#160;<br/>
squashed under that Hyperborean giant's butt,&#160;but I&#160;knew better. He'd be back, tonight at the latest.&#160;<br/>
&#34;And Typhon?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
Chiron's face&#160;darkened. &#34;The gods are tiring. Dionysus was incapacitated yesterday.&#160;Typhon smashed&#160;<br/>
his chariot, and the wine&#160;god went down somewhere&#160;m&#160;the Appalachians. No one has seen him&#160;since.&#160;<br/>Hephaestus is&#160;out of action as&#160;well. He&#160;was thrown from&#160;the battle so hard he&#160;created&#160;a new&#160;lake in West&#160;<br/>Virginia. He will heal, but not soon&#160;enough to help. The&#160;others&#160;still fight.&#160;They've managed to slow&#160;<br/>Typhon's approach. But the&#160;monster&#160;can not be stopped. He will arrive in New&#160;York by&#160;this time&#160;<br/>tomorrow. Once he and Kronos combine forces—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then what chance do we have?&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;We can't&#160;hold out another&#160;day.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll have to,&#34; Thalia said. &#34;I'll see about setting some new traps&#160;around the perimeter.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She looked&#160;exhausted. Her jacket was smeared in grime and&#160;monster dust, but she managed to get to&#160;<br/>
her feet and stagger off.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will help her,&#34; Chiron decided. &#34;I should make&#160;sure&#160;my&#160;brethren don't go too overboard&#160;with the&#160;<br/>
root beer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought&#160;&#34;too&#160;overboard&#34;&#160;pretty much summed up the Party Ponies, but&#160;Chiron&#160;cantered off,&#160;leaving&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and&#160;me alone.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=136></a>She cleaned&#160;the&#160;monster&#160;slime off her knife. I'd&#160;seen her do that hundreds of times, but I'd never&#160;<br/>
thought about&#160;why she cared so much about the blade.&#160;<br/>
&#34;At least your mom is okay,&#34; I offered.&#160;<br/>
&#34;If you call fighting Typhon&#160;<i>okay.</i>&#34;<i>&#160;</i>She locked eyes with me. &#34;Percy, even with the centaurs'&#160;help, I'm&#160;<br/>
starting to think—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know.&#34; I&#160;had a bad feeling this might be our last&#160;chance to talk,&#160;and I felt like there were a&#160;million&#160;<br/>
things I hadn't&#160;told&#160;her. &#34;Listen, there were&#160;some&#160;. . . some visions Hestia&#160;showed me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You mean about Luke?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Maybe it was just a safe&#160;guess, but I got the feeling Annabeth&#160;knew what I'd been holding back.&#160;<br/>
Maybe she'd been having&#160;dreams&#160;of her own.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said. &#34;You and&#160;Thalia and Luke. The first time you met.&#160;And the time you met Hermes.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth slipped her knife&#160;back into its sheath. &#34;Luke&#160;promised&#160;he'd&#160;never let&#160;me&#160;get hurt. He said . .&#160;<br/>
. he said we'd&#160;be a new family, and it would turn out&#160;better than his.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her eyes reminded me&#160;of that seven-year-old girl's&#160;in&#160;the alley—angry,&#160;scared, desperate for a&#160;friend.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thalia talked to me&#160;earlier,&#34; I said. &#34;She's afraid—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That I can't face Luke,&#34; she said&#160;miserably.&#160;<br/>
I nodded.&#160;&#34;But there's&#160;something else&#160;you should know. Ethan&#160;Nakamura&#160;seemed to think Luke was&#160;<br/>
still alive inside his body,&#160;maybe even fighting Kronos for control.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth tried to hide it, but I could almost&#160;see her&#160;mind working on the possibilities, maybe starting&#160;<br/>
to hope.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I didn't want to tell&#160;you,&#34; I&#160;admitted.&#160;<br/>
She looked&#160;up&#160;at the Empire State Building. &#34;Percy, for so much of my&#160;life, I felt like everything was&#160;<br/>
changing, all&#160;the time. I didn't&#160;have anyone I could rely on.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded.&#160;That&#160;was something most demigods could understand.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I ran away&#160;when I was&#160;seven,&#34; she said. &#34;Then with&#160;Luke and Thalia, I thought I'd found a family,&#160;<br/>
but it fell apart almost immediately.&#160;What I'm&#160;saying .&#160;. . I&#160;<i>hate&#160;</i>it&#160;when people let me&#160;down, when things&#160;<br/>are temporary.&#160;I think that's&#160;why I want to be an architect.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;To build&#160;something permanent,&#34; I said. &#34;A monument to last a thousand&#160;years.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She held my&#160;eyes. &#34;I guess that sounds like my&#160;fatal flaw again.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Years ago in&#160;the Sea of&#160;Monsters, Annabeth had told me&#160;her biggest flaw was pride—thinking&#160;she&#160;<br/>
could fix anything. I'd even seen a glimpse of her&#160;deepest desire, shown to her by&#160;the Sirens'&#160;magic.&#160;<br/>Annabeth had imagined her&#160;mother&#160;and father together, standing&#160;in&#160;front of a newly&#160;rebuilt Manhattan,&#160;<br/>designed by&#160;Annabeth. And Luke had&#160;been&#160;there too—good&#160;again, welcoming her home.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=137></a>&#34;I guess I understand how&#160;you feel,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;But&#160;Thalia's&#160;right. Luke has already&#160;betrayed&#160;you so&#160;<br/>
many&#160;times.&#160;He was evil even before Kronos. I don't want him&#160;to hurt&#160;you anymore.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth pursed her lips. I could tell she was trying not to get&#160;mad. &#34;And you'll understand if I keep&#160;<br/>
hoping&#160;there's a chance you're wrong.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I looked away. I felt like I'd done my&#160;best, but that&#160;didn't&#160;make&#160;me feel any&#160;better.&#160;<br/>
Across the street, the Apollo campers&#160;had set up a&#160;field hospital&#160;to tend&#160;the&#160;wounded—dozens of<i>&#160;</i><br/>
campers and&#160;almost&#160;as&#160;many&#160;Hunters.&#160;I was&#160;watching the&#160;medics work, and&#160;thinking&#160;about our slim&#160;<br/>chances for holding Mount Olympus. . .&#160;.&#160;<br/>
And suddenly:&#160;I wasn't&#160;there anymore.&#160;<br/>
I was standing in a long dingy&#160;bar with black walls,&#160;neon signs, and a bunch of&#160;partying&#160;adults. A&#160;<br/>
banner across the bar read&#160;HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BOBBY&#160;EARL. Country&#160;music played&#160;on&#160;the speakers.&#160;<br/>Big guys&#160;in jeans and work&#160;shirts crowded the bar.&#160;Waitresses&#160;carried trays of drinks and shouted at each&#160;<br/>other. It was pretty much exactly&#160;the kind of place my&#160;mom would never let&#160;me&#160;go.&#160;<br/>
I was stuck&#160;in&#160;the very&#160;back of the room,&#160;next to&#160;the bathrooms&#160;(which didn't smell&#160;so great) and a&#160;<br/>
couple of antique arcade games.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh good,&#160;you're here,&#34; said the man at the&#160;Pac-Man machine. &#34;I'll have a Diet Coke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He was a pudgy&#160;guy&#160;in a&#160;leopard-skin&#160;Hawaiian shirt, purple shorts, red running shoes, and black&#160;<br/>
socks, which&#160;didn't exactly&#160;make him&#160;blend in with&#160;the crowd. His nose&#160;was bright red. A bandage was&#160;<br/>wrapped around his curly black hair like&#160;he was recovering from&#160;a&#160;concussion.&#160;<br/>
I blinked.&#160;&#34;Mr. D?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He sighed, not taking his eyes from&#160;the&#160;game. &#34;Really, Peter Johnson, how long will it take&#160;for you to&#160;<br/>
recognize&#160;me&#160;on sight?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;About as long&#160;as it'll take&#160;for&#160;you&#160;to figure&#160;out my&#160;name,&#34; I&#160;muttered. &#34;Where are we?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Why, Bobby Earl's birthday party,&#34; Dionysus said. &#34;Somewhere in lovely&#160;rural America.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I thought Typhon&#160;swatted you&#160;out of&#160;the&#160;sky. They&#160;said&#160;you crash-landed.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your concern is touching.&#160;I&#160;<i>did&#160;</i>crash-land. Very&#160;painfully.&#160;In fact, part of&#160;me is still buried&#160;under a&#160;<br/>
hundred feet&#160;of rubble in&#160;an abandoned coal&#160;mine. It&#160;will be several&#160;more hours before I have enough&#160;<br/>strength to mend. But in the&#160;meantime,&#160;part of my&#160;consciousness is&#160;<i>here.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;At a bar, playing Pac-Man.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Party&#160;time,&#34; Dionysus said. &#34;Surely&#160;you've heard of it. Wherever&#160;there is a&#160;party,&#160;my&#160;presence&#160;is&#160;<br/>
invoked. Because of this,&#160;I can exist in many&#160;different places at once. The only problem&#160;was finding a&#160;<br/>party.&#160;I don't know if&#160;you're aware how serious things&#160;are outside your safe little bubble&#160;of New York—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Safe little bubble?&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;</i>—but believe&#160;me, the&#160;mortals out here in the heartland are panicking. Typhon&#160;has terrified them.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=138></a>Very&#160;few are throwing&#160;parties. Apparently Bobby Earl and his friends, bless them,&#160;are a little slow. They&#160;<br/>haven't yet figured out that&#160;the world is&#160;ending.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So . .&#160;. I'm&#160;not really&#160;here?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No. In a&#160;moment I'll&#160;send you back to your normal&#160;insignificant life, and it will be as if nothing had&#160;<br/>
happened.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And&#160;<i>why&#160;</i>did&#160;you bring&#160;me&#160;here?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Dionysus snorted. &#34;Oh, I&#160;didn't want you particularly. Any&#160;of&#160;you&#160;silly heroes would do. That Annie&#160;<br/>
girl—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The point&#160;is,&#34;&#160;he said, &#34;I pulled&#160;you into&#160;party time to&#160;deliver a warning. We are&#160;in&#160;<i>danger.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Gee,&#34; I said. &#34;Never would've figured that out.<i><b>&#160;</b></i>Thanks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He glared at&#160;me and&#160;momentarily&#160;forgot&#160;his&#160;game. Pac-Man got eaten by&#160;the red ghost dude.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Erre es&#160;korakas,&#160;</i>Blinky!&#34;&#160;Dionysus cursed. &#34;I will have your soul!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;he's a video game&#160;character,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's no excuse! And you're ruining&#160;my&#160;game, Jorgenson!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Jackson.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Whichever! Now listen, the situation is&#160;graver than&#160;you imagine. &#160;If Olympus falls, not only&#160;will the&#160;<br/>
gods fade, but everything that is connected to our legacy&#160;will also begin to&#160;unravel. The very&#160;fabric of&#160;<br/>your puny little civilization—&#34;&#160;<br/>
The game played a song and Mr. D progressed to level 254.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ha!&#34; he shouted. &#34;Take that,&#160;you&#160;pixelated fiends!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;fabric of civilization,&#34; I prompted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, yes. Your entire society&#160;will dissolve. Perhaps&#160;not right away, but mark my&#160;words, the chaos of&#160;<br/>
the Titans&#160;will&#160;mean the&#160;end of Western civilization.&#160;Art, law, wine tastings,&#160;music, video games, silk&#160;<br/>shirts, black velvet paintings—all the things&#160;that make life worth living will disappear!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So why&#160;aren't&#160;the gods rushing back to&#160;help us?&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;We should combine forces at&#160;Olympus.&#160;<br/>
Forget Typhon.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He snapped his fingers impatiently.&#160;&#34;You&#160;forgot&#160;my&#160;Diet Coke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Gods, you're annoying.&#34;&#160;I got the attention of a&#160;waitress and&#160;ordered the stupid soda. I&#160;put it on&#160;<br/>
Bobby&#160;Earl's&#160;tab.&#160;<br/>
Mr. D took a&#160;good&#160;long&#160;drink. His eyes&#160;never left the video game. &#34;The truth is,&#160;Pierre—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=139></a>&#34;—the other&#160;gods would&#160;<i>never&#160;</i>admit this, but we actually&#160;<i>need&#160;</i>you mortals to rescue Olympus. You&#160;<br/>
see, we are&#160;manifestations of&#160;your&#160;culture. If you&#160;don't care enough&#160;to save Olympus&#160;yourselves—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Like Pan,&#34; I&#160;said, &#34;depending on&#160;the satyrs to save the Wild.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, quite. I will deny&#160;I&#160;ever said this, of course, but the gods&#160;<i>need&#160;&#160;</i>heroes. They&#160;always&#160;have.&#160;<br/>
Otherwise&#160;we would not keep you annoying little brats&#160;around.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I feel so wanted. Thanks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Use the training I have given you at camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;<i>What&#160;</i>training?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know.&#160;All those hero techniques&#160;and . .&#160;.&#160;No!&#34; Mr. D slapped the game console.&#160;<i>&#34;Na pari i&#160;</i><br/>
<i>eychi!&#160;</i>The last level!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He looked at&#160;me, and purple fire flickered in his&#160;eyes. &#34;As 1 recall, I once predicted you would turn&#160;<br/>
out to&#160;be as selfish as all the other human heroes.&#160;Well, here is your&#160;chance to prove me&#160;wrong.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#160;making&#160;you proud is&#160;real high on&#160;my&#160;list.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You must&#160;save Olympus,&#160;Pedro! Leave Typhon to&#160;the Olympians&#160;and save our own seats of&#160;power.&#160;<br/>
It must be done!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Great. Nice little chat. Now, if you&#160;don't mind,&#160;my&#160;friends will be wondering—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;There is&#160;more,&#34; Mr. D&#160;warned. &#34;Kronos has not yet attained full&#160;power. The body&#160;of the mortal was&#160;<br/>
only&#160;a temporary&#160;measure.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We&#160;kind of guessed&#160;that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And did&#160;you also guess that within a day&#160;at&#160;most, Kronos will burn away&#160;that&#160;mortal body&#160;and take&#160;<br/>
on the true form&#160;of a Titan king?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And that would mean . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Dionysus inserted another quarter. &#34;You&#160;know about the true forms&#160;of the gods.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah. You can't&#160;look at them&#160;without burning&#160;up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Kronos would be ten times&#160;more powerful. His very&#160;presence would incinerate you. And&#160;once he&#160;<br/>
achieves this, he will&#160;empower the other Titans. They&#160;are weak&#160;now, compared to what they&#160;will soon&#160;<br/>become, unless you can stop them. The world will fall, the gods&#160;will die, and I will never achieve&#160;a&#160;<br/>perfect score&#160;on this stupid machine.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Maybe I should've been terrified, but&#160;honestly, I&#160;was already&#160;about&#160;as scared as I could get.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Can I go now?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;One last thing. My&#160;son Pollux. Is he alive?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I blinked. &#34;Yeah, last I saw him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I would very&#160;much appreciate it if you could&#160;keep him&#160;that&#160;way.&#160;I&#160;lost his brother Castor last&#160;year—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=140></a>&#34;I remember.&#34; I stared at&#160;him,&#160;trying to&#160;wrap&#160;my&#160;mind around&#160;the idea that Dionysus could be&#160;a&#160;<br/>
caring father. I wondered how many&#160;other Olympians were thinking about&#160;their demigod children right&#160;<br/>now. &#34;I'll do&#160;my&#160;best.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your best,&#34;&#160;Dionysus muttered. &#34;Well, isn't&#160;<i>that&#160;</i>reassuring. Go now. You have some&#160;nasty&#160;surprises&#160;<br/>
to deal with,&#160;and I must defeat Blinky!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nasty&#160;surprises?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He waved his hand, and&#160;the bar disappeared.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I was back on&#160;Fifth Avenue. Annabeth hadn't&#160;moved. She didn't&#160;give any&#160;sign&#160;that I'd been gone or&#160;<br/>anything.&#160;<br/>
She caught me staring and frowned. &#34;What?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um&#160;. . . nothing, I&#160;guess.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I gazed down the avenue, wondering&#160;what Mr. D&#160;had meant by&#160;nasty&#160;surprises. How&#160;much worse&#160;<br/>
could it&#160;get?&#160;<br/>
My&#160;eyes rested on a beat-up blue car. The hood was&#160;badly&#160;dented, like somebody&#160;had tried to hammer&#160;<br/>
out some&#160;huge craters. My&#160;skin tingled.&#160;Why&#160;<i>did&#160;</i>that&#160;car look so familiar? Then&#160;I realized it was a Prius.&#160;<br/>
<i>Paul's&#160;</i>Prius.&#160;<br/>
I bolted down the street.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; Annabeth called. &#34;Where are you going?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Paul was passed out in the&#160;driver's seat.&#160;My&#160;mom&#160;was&#160;snoring&#160;beside him.&#160;My&#160;mind felt like mush.&#160;<br/>
How had I not seen them&#160;before? They'd&#160;been sitting&#160;here in traffic for over a day, the battle raging&#160;<br/>around them,&#160;and I hadn't even noticed<i>.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;They&#160;. . . they&#160;must've seen those blue lights in&#160;the sky.&#34; I rattled the doors but they&#160;were locked. &#34;I&#160;<br/>
need to get them&#160;out.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth said gently.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I can't&#160;leave&#160;them&#160;here!&#34; I&#160;sounded a little crazy.&#160;I pounded on the windshield.&#160;&#34;I&#160;have to&#160;move them.&#160;<br/>
I have to—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, just .&#160;. . just hold&#160;on.&#34; Annabeth&#160;waved to&#160;Chiron, who was talking to&#160;some centaurs down the&#160;<br/>
block. &#34;We can push the car to a side street, all right? They're going&#160;to be fine.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;hands trembled. After&#160;all I'd been through over the last few<i>&#160;</i>days, I felt so&#160;stupid and weak, but&#160;<br/>
the sight of my&#160;parents made me want to break down.&#160;<br/>
Chiron galloped over. &#34;What's . . . Oh dear. I see.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;They were coming to find&#160;me,&#34; I said. &#34;My&#160;mom&#160;must've&#160;sensed something was wrong.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=141></a>&#34;Most likely,&#34; Chiron said. &#34;But, Percy,&#160;they&#160;will be&#160;fine. The best thing we can do for them&#160;is&#160;stay&#160;<br/>
focused on our job.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Then I noticed something in the backseat of the&#160;Prius, and&#160;my&#160;heart skipped a beat. Seat-belted&#160;<br/>
behind my&#160;mother was a black-and-white Greek jar about&#160;three feet tall. Its lid&#160;was wrapped in a leather&#160;<br/>harness.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No way,&#34; I&#160;muttered.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth pressed her hand to the window. &#34;That's impossible! I thought&#160;you left that at the Plaza.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Locked in a&#160;vault,&#34; I agreed.&#160;<br/>
Chiron saw the jar and his eyes widened. &#34;That isn't— &#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Pandora's jar.&#34; I told&#160;him&#160;about my&#160;meeting with Prometheus.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then the jar&#160;is<i>&#160;</i>yours,&#34; Chiron said grimly. &#34;It will follow&#160;you and tempt you to&#160;open it, no matter&#160;<br/>
where you leave it. It will appear when you are weakest.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Like now, I thought. Looking at my&#160;helpless parents.&#160;<br/>
I imagined Prometheus smiling, so anxious to help&#160;out&#160;us poor mortals.&#160;<i>Give up Hope, and I&#160;will&#160;</i><br/>
<i>know that you are surrendering.&#160;I promise Kronos will be lenient.</i>&#160;<br/>
Anger surged through me.&#160;I drew&#160;Riptide and cut through the driver's&#160;side window like it was&#160;made&#160;<br/>
of plastic wrap.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll put the car in neutral,&#34; I said. &#34;Push them&#160;out of the way.&#160;And take that stupid jar to Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron nodded. &#34;A good plan. But, Percy . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Whatever he was going to&#160;say, he faltered. A mechanical drumbeat&#160;grew loud in&#160;the distance—the&#160;<br/>
<i>chop-chop-chop&#160;</i>of a helicopter.&#160;<br/>
On a normal&#160;Monday&#160;morning in New York, this would've been no big&#160;deal, but after two days&#160;of&#160;<br/>
silence, a&#160;mortal helicopter was the oddest thing I'd ever heard.&#160;A few blocks&#160;east, the&#160;monster army&#160;<br/>shouted and&#160;jeered as the helicopter came&#160;into view.<i>&#160;&#160;</i>It was a&#160;civilian model painted dark red, with&#160;a&#160;<br/>bright green &#34;DE&#34; logo on&#160;the side. The words under&#160;the logo were too small to read, but I knew what&#160;<br/>they said: DARE ENTERPRISES.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;throat closed up. I looked at Annabeth and could tell she recognized the logo&#160;too. Her face&#160;was as&#160;<br/>
red as the helicopter.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What is&#160;<i>she&#160;</i>doing&#160;here?&#34;&#160;Annabeth demanded. &#34;How did she get&#160;through the barrier?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Who?&#34; Chiron looked confused. &#34;What mortal&#160;would be insane enough—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Suddenly the&#160;helicopter pitched forward.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The Morpheus enchantment!&#34; Chiron&#160;said.&#160;&#34;The foolish mortal pilot is asleep.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I watched in<i>&#160;&#160;</i>horror as the helicopter&#160;careened sideways, falling toward a row of office buildings.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=142></a>Even if it didn't crash, the gods of<i>&#160;&#160;</i>the&#160;air would probably&#160;swat it out of&#160;the&#160;sky&#160;for coming near the&#160;<br/>Empire State&#160;Building.&#160;<br/>
I was too paralyzed to move, but Annabeth whistled and Guido&#160;the pegasus swooped out of&#160;nowhere.&#160;<br/>
<i>You rang for&#160;a handsome horse?&#160;</i>he asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come on, Percy,&#34; Annabeth growled. &#34;We have to save&#160;<i>your friend.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
SIXTEEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
WE &#160;GET &#160;HELP &#160;FROM&#160;<br/>
A &#160;THIEF&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Here's&#160;my&#160;definition of&#160;<i>not fun.&#160;</i>Fly&#160;a pegasus toward an out-of-control helicopter. If Guido had been any&#160;<br/>less of a fancy flier, we would've been chopped&#160;to confetti.&#160;<br/>
I could hear Rachel screaming inside. For some reason,&#160;<i>she&#160;</i>hadn't fallen asleep, but I could see the&#160;<br/>
pilot slumped&#160;over the controls, pitching&#160;back and forth as the helicopter wobbled toward the side of&#160;an&#160;<br/>office building.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ideas?&#34; I asked Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're going to have to&#160;take Guido and get out,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What are&#160;<i>you&#160;</i>going to&#160;do?&#34;&#160;<br/>
In response, she said, &#34;Hyah!&#34; and Guido went into a&#160;nosedive.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Duck!&#34; Annabeth&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
We passed so&#160;close to the rotors&#160;I felt the force of the blades ripping at&#160;my&#160;hair.&#160;We zipped along the&#160;<br/>
side of the helicopter, and&#160;Annabeth grabbed the door.&#160;<br/>
That's&#160;when things went wrong.&#160;<br/>
Guido's wing slammed against the helicopter. He&#160;plummeted straight down with me on his back,&#160;<br/>
leaving Annabeth dangling from&#160;the side of the aircraft. I was so terrified I could barely&#160;think,&#160;but as&#160;<br/>Guido spiraled I caught a glimpse of Rachel pulling Annabeth inside the copter.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hang in there!&#34; I yelled at&#160;Guido.&#160;<br/>
<i>My&#160;wing,&#160;</i>he moaned.&#160;<i>It's busted.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can do&#160;it!&#34; I desperately&#160;tried to remember what&#160;Silena used to&#160;tell us in&#160;pegasus-riding lessons.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=143></a>&#34;Just relax the wing. Extend it and&#160;glide.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We fell like&#160;a rock—straight toward&#160;the pavement three hundred feet&#160;below. At the last&#160;moment&#160;<br/>
Guido extended his wings. I saw the&#160;faces of&#160;centaurs&#160;gaping up at us. Then&#160;we pulled out of our dive,&#160;<br/>sailed fifty&#160;feet, and tumbled onto the pavement—pegasus over demigod.&#160;<br/>
<i>Ow!&#160;</i>Guido moaned.&#160;<i>My&#160;legs. My&#160;head. My&#160;wings.</i>&#160;<br/>
Chiron galloped over with&#160;his medical pouch and&#160;began working&#160;on&#160;the pegasus.&#160;<br/>
I got to my&#160;feet. When I looked up, my&#160;heart crawled into my&#160;throat. The helicopter was only&#160;a few&#160;<br/>
seconds away&#160;from&#160;slamming into&#160;the side of the building.&#160;<br/>
Then miraculously&#160;the helicopter righted itself. It&#160;spun in a circle and hovered. Very&#160;slowly,&#160;it began&#160;<br/>
to descend.&#160;<br/>
It seemed to&#160;take forever, but finally&#160;the helicopter thudded to&#160;a landing in&#160;the&#160;middle of Fifth&#160;<br/>
Avenue. I looked through&#160;the windshield and couldn't&#160;believe what I was seeing. Annabeth&#160;was&#160;at the&#160;<br/>controls.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I ran forward as the rotors spun to&#160;a stop.&#160;Rachel&#160;opened the side door and dragged out the pilot.&#160;<br/>
Rachel&#160;was still dressed like she&#160;was on vacation, in beach shorts,&#160;a T-shirt, and sandals. Her&#160;hair was&#160;<br/>
tangled and her face&#160;was green from&#160;the helicopter ride.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth climbed out last.&#160;<br/>
I stared at her in awe. &#34;I didn't know&#160;you could fly a&#160;helicopter.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Neither did<i>&#160;&#160;</i>I,&#34; she said. &#34;My&#160;dad's crazy&#160;into aviation.&#160;Plus, Daedalus had&#160;some&#160;notes on&#160;flying&#160;<br/>
machines. I just took my&#160;best guess on the controls.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You saved my&#160;life,&#34; Rachel said.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth flexed her bad&#160;shoulder.&#160;&#34;Yeah, well .&#160;.&#160;.&#160;let's not make&#160;a habit of&#160;it. What are&#160;you&#160;<i>doing&#160;</i><br/>
here, Dare? Don't you know&#160;better than to fly&#160;into a&#160;war zone?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I—&#34; Rachel&#160;glanced at&#160;me. &#34;I had to&#160;be&#160;here. I knew Percy&#160;was in trouble.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Got that right,&#34; Annabeth grumbled. &#34;Well,&#160;if you'll excuse&#160;me,&#160;I have some injured&#160;<i>friends&#160;</i>I've got&#160;<br/>
to tend to. Glad you could&#160;stop by,&#160;Rachel.&#34;&#160;<br/>
'Annabeth—&#34; I called.&#160;<br/>
She stormed off.&#160;<br/>
Rachel plopped down on the curb and put her head in&#160;her hands. &#34;I'm sorry, Percy. I didn't mean to . .&#160;<br/>
. I always&#160;mess things up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
It was kind of hard to argue with her, though I&#160;was glad she was safe. I looked in the direction&#160;<br/>
Annabeth had gone, but she'd disappeared into the crowd. I couldn't&#160;believe what she'd just done—saved&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=144></a>Rachel's life,&#160;landed a helicopter, and walked away&#160;like it was no big deal.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's okay,&#34; I told Rachel, though my&#160;words sounded hollow. &#34;So what's the&#160;message you wanted to&#160;<br/>
deliver?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She frowned.&#160;&#34;How did&#160;you know about&#160;that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;A dream.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel didn't look&#160;surprised. She tugged at her&#160;beach shorts. They were covered in&#160;drawings, which&#160;<br/>
wasn't&#160;unusual for her, but&#160;these symbols I recognized: Greek letters, pictures from&#160;camp beads, sketches&#160;<br/>of monsters and&#160;faces&#160;of gods.&#160;I&#160;didn't understand how Rachel&#160;could&#160;have known about&#160;some&#160;of that.&#160;<br/>She'd never been to Olympus or Camp&#160;Half-Blood.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I've been seeing things too,&#34; she muttered. &#34;I mean, not just through the Mist.&#160;This is different. I've&#160;<br/>
been drawing pictures, writing lines—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;In Ancient Greek,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;Do&#160;you know what they say?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's&#160;what I wanted to talk to&#160;you&#160;about. I&#160;was hoping&#160;. . .&#160;well, if you&#160;had gone with us on&#160;<br/>
vacation, I was hoping&#160;you could&#160;have helped&#160;me&#160;figure out what's&#160;happening&#160;to&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She looked at&#160;me pleadingly.&#160;Her face was sunburned from&#160;the beach. Her&#160;nose was peeling. I&#160;<br/>
couldn't get over the shock&#160;that she was&#160;here in person. She'd forced her&#160;family&#160;to cut short their vacation,&#160;<br/>agreed to go&#160;to a horrible&#160;school, and flown a helicopter&#160;into a monster battle just to see&#160;me. In her own&#160;<br/>way,&#160;she was as brave as Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
But what was happening to her with these visions really freaked me&#160;out. Maybe it was something that&#160;<br/>
happened to all&#160;mortals who could see&#160;through the Mist. But&#160;my&#160;mom had never talked about anything&#160;<br/>like that. And&#160;Hestia's&#160;words about Luke's&#160;mom&#160;kept coming back&#160;to me:&#160;<i>May Castellan went&#160;too far.&#160;She&#160;</i><br/>
<i>tried to see too much.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel,&#34; I said, &#34;I wish I knew. Maybe&#160;we should ask Chiron—&#34;&#160;<br/>
She flinched like she'd gotten an electric shock. &#34;Percy, something is about to&#160;happen. A trick that&#160;<br/>
ends in death.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What do&#160;you&#160;mean? Whose death?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know.&#34; She looked&#160;around&#160;nervously. &#34;Don't&#160;you feel it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is that the message you wanted to<i>&#160;</i>tell me?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No.&#34; She hesitated. &#34;I'm&#160;sorry.&#160;I'm&#160;not&#160;making sense, but that thought just came to&#160;me. The&#160;message&#160;<br/>
I wrote on the&#160;beach was different. It had&#160;your&#160;name in it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Perseus,&#34; I remembered. &#34;In Ancient Greek.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel nodded. &#34;I don't know its meaning. But&#160;I&#160;know it's important. You&#160;have to&#160;hear it.&#160;It said,&#160;<br/>
<i>Perseus, you&#160;are not the hero.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at her&#160;like she'd just slapped me. &#34;You came&#160;thousands of miles to tell me I'm&#160;not the hero?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=145></a>&#34;It's important,&#34; she insisted. &#34;It will affect what you&#160;do.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not the hero&#160;of the prophecy?&#34; I asked.&#160;&#34;Not&#160;the hero&#160;who defeats Kronos? What&#160;do&#160;you mean?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;. . . I'm sorry,&#160;Percy.&#160;That's&#160;all I know. I had to tell&#160;you&#160;because—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well!&#34; Chiron cantered over. &#34;This must be Miss Dare.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to&#160;yell at him&#160;to go away,&#160;but&#160;of course I couldn't. I tried&#160;to get my&#160;emotions&#160;under&#160;control. I&#160;<br/>
felt like I had another personal hurricane swirling around me. &#34;Chiron, Rachel Dare,&#34; I said. &#34;Rachel, this&#160;<br/>is&#160;my&#160;teacher Chiron.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hello,&#34; Rachel said glumly. She didn't look at all surprised that Chiron was a centaur.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You are not&#160;asleep, Miss&#160;Dare,&#34; he noticed. &#34;And&#160;yet&#160;you are mortal?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;mortal,&#34;&#160;she agreed, like it was a depressing thought. &#34;The pilot fell asleep&#160;as soon as we passed&#160;<br/>
the river.&#160;I don't&#160;know why I didn't. I just&#160;knew I had to&#160;be here, to&#160;warn Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Warn Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;She's&#160;been seeing things,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Writing lines and&#160;making drawings.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron raised an eyebrow. &#34;Indeed?&#160;Tell me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She told him&#160;the same&#160;things she'd told me.&#160;<br/>
Chiron stroked his beard. &#34;Miss Dare . . . perhaps we should talk.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Chiron,&#34; I&#160;blurted. I&#160;had a sudden terrible image of Camp&#160;Half-Blood in&#160;the 1990s, and May&#160;<br/>
Castellan's scream&#160;coming from&#160;that attic. &#34;You . .&#160;.&#160;you'll&#160;<i>help&#160;</i>Rachel, right?&#160;I&#160;mean, you'll&#160;warn her that&#160;<br/>she's got to be careful with&#160;this stuff. Not go too far.&#34;&#160;<br/>
His tail flicked like it does when he's&#160;anxious. &#34;Yes,&#160;Percy.&#160;I will do my&#160;best to understand what is&#160;<br/>
happening&#160;and advise Miss Dare, but this&#160;may&#160;take&#160;some time. Meanwhile,&#160;you should&#160;rest. We've&#160;moved&#160;<br/>your parents'&#160;car to safety.&#160;The enemy&#160;seems to be&#160;staying put for&#160;now. We've&#160;set up bunks in&#160;the Empire&#160;<br/>State Building. Get some sleep.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Everybody keeps telling me to sleep,&#34; I grumbled. &#34;I don't need sleep.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron managed a smile. &#34;Have you looked at&#160;yourself recently, Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I glanced down at my&#160;clothes, which&#160;were scorched, burned, sliced, and tattered from&#160;my&#160;night of&#160;<br/>
constant battles. &#34;I look like death,&#34; I admitted. &#34;But you think I&#160;can sleep after&#160;what just happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You may&#160;be invulnerable in combat,&#34; Chiron chided, &#34;but that only&#160;makes your body&#160;tire faster. I&#160;<br/>
remember&#160;Achilles. Whenever that lad&#160;wasn't fighting,&#160;he was&#160;sleeping. He&#160;must’ve taken twenty&#160;naps a&#160;<br/>day.&#160;You, Percy,&#160;need&#160;your&#160;rest. You may be our&#160;only&#160;hope.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to complain that I&#160;<i>wasn't&#160;</i>their&#160;only hope,&#160;According to&#160;Rachel, I wasn't even the hero. But&#160;<br/>
the look&#160;in Chiron's eyes made it clear he wasn't&#160;going to take&#160;no&#160;for an answer.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Sure,&#34; I grumbled. &#34;Talk.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=146></a>I trudged toward the Empire State Building. When&#160;I&#160;glanced back, Rachel&#160;and Chiron were walking&#160;<br/>
together in earnest conversation, like they&#160;were discussing funeral arrangements.&#160;<br/>
Inside the lobby,&#160;I&#160;found&#160;an empty&#160;bunk and collapsed, sure that I would&#160;never be able to&#160;sleep.&#160;A&#160;<br/>
second later, my&#160;eyes closed.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
In my&#160;dreams, I was back&#160;in Hades's garden. The lord of the dead paced up and down, holding&#160;his ears&#160;<br/>while Nico followed him,&#160;waving his arms.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You&#160;<i>have&#160;</i>to!&#34; Nico insisted.&#160;<br/>
Demeter and Persephone sat behind them&#160;at the breakfast table. Both of&#160;the goddesses looked bored.&#160;<br/>
Demeter poured shredded wheat into four huge bowls. Persephone was&#160;magically&#160;changing the flower&#160;<br/>arrangement&#160;on the table, turning&#160;the blossoms&#160;from&#160;red to&#160;yellow&#160;to polka-dotted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't&#160;<i>have&#160;</i>to do anything!&#34; Hades s eyes blazed.<i>&#160;</i>&#34;I'm&#160;a&#160;god!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Father,&#34; Nico said, &#34;if Olympus falls, your own&#160;palace's&#160;safety&#160;doesn't&#160;matter. You'll fade too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I am&#160;not an&#160;Olympian!&#34; he growled. &#34;My&#160;family&#160;has&#160;made that&#160;<i>quite&#160;</i>clear.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You are,''<i>&#160;</i>Nico said. &#34;Whether you like&#160;it or not.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You saw what they&#160;did to your mother,&#34; Hades&#160;said. &#34;Zeus killed her. And&#160;you would have&#160;me&#160;<i>help&#160;</i><br/>
them?&#160;They&#160;deserve what they&#160;get!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Persephone sighed. She walked her fingers across the&#160;table, absently turning the silverware into roses.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Could we&#160;<i>please&#160;</i>not talk&#160;about that woman?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You know what would help&#160;this&#160;boy?&#34; Demeter&#160;mused.&#160;&#34;Farming.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Persephone rolled her eyes. &#34;Mother—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Six months behind a plow. Excellent character building.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico stepped&#160;in front of his father, forcing Hades to face him.&#160;&#34;My&#160;mother understood about&#160;family.&#160;<br/>
That's&#160;why&#160;she didn't want&#160;to leave us.&#160;You can't&#160;just abandon&#160;your family&#160;because they&#160;did something&#160;<br/>horrible. You've done horrible things to&#160;them&#160;too.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maria died!&#34; Hades reminded him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can't&#160;just cut yourself off from&#160;the other gods!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I've done very&#160;well at it for thousands of&#160;years.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And has that&#160;made you feel any&#160;better?&#34; Nico demanded. &#34;Has that curse on the Oracle helped you at&#160;<br/>
all? Holding&#160;grudges is a fatal flaw. Bianca warned&#160;me about that, and she was right.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;For demigods! I am&#160;immortal, all-powerful! I would&#160;not&#160;help&#160;the other gods if they&#160;begged me, if&#160;<br/>
Percy&#160;Jackson himself pleaded—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're just&#160;as&#160;much&#160;of an&#160;outcast as&#160;I&#160;am!&#34; Nico&#160;yelled. &#34;Stop being angry&#160;about it and do something&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=147></a>helpful for&#160;once. That's the only&#160;way&#160;they'll respect you!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades's palm&#160;filled with black fire.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Go ahead,&#34; Nico said. &#34;Blast&#160;me.&#160;That's just what the other gods would expect from&#160;you. Prove them&#160;<br/>
right.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, please,&#34; Demeter complained. &#34;Shut him&#160;up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Persephone sighed. &#34;Oh,&#160;I&#160;don't know.&#160;I&#160;would rather&#160;fight in&#160;the war than eat another bowl of&#160;cereal.&#160;<br/>
This is boring.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades roared&#160;in anger. His fireball hit a&#160;silver tree right next to&#160;Nico, melting it&#160;into a pool&#160;of&#160;liquid&#160;<br/>
metal.&#160;<br/>
And my&#160;dream&#160;changed.&#160;<br/>
I was standing outside the&#160;United Nations, about&#160;a mile northeast&#160;of the Empire State Building. The&#160;<br/>
Titan army&#160;had set up camp all around the UN&#160;complex. The flagpoles&#160;were hung with horrible&#160;<br/>trophies—helmets and armor pieces from&#160;defeated&#160;campers. All&#160;along First&#160;Avenue, giants sharpened&#160;<br/>their axes. Telkhines repaired&#160;armor at&#160;makeshift forges.&#160;<br/>
Kronos himself paced at the top of the&#160;plaza, swinging his scythe so his&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;</i>bodyguards stayed&#160;<br/>
way&#160;back. Ethan Nakamura and Prometheus stood nearby,&#160;out&#160;of slicing range.&#160;Ethan was fidgeting with&#160;<br/>his shield straps, but Prometheus looked&#160;as calm and collected as ever in his tuxedo.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I hate this place,&#34;&#160;Kronos growled. &#34;<i>United Nations.&#160;</i>As if&#160;mankind could ever&#160;unite. Remind&#160;me&#160;to&#160;<br/>
tear down this&#160;building after we destroy&#160;Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes, lord.&#34; Prometheus smiled as&#160;if his&#160;master's anger amused him.&#160;&#34;Shall we&#160;tear down the stables&#160;<br/>
in Central Park too? I&#160;know&#160;how much horses can annoy&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't&#160;mock&#160;me, Prometheus! Those cursed centaurs&#160;will be sorry&#160;they&#160;interfered. I will feed&#160;them&#160;to&#160;<br/>
the hellhounds, starting with that son&#160;of&#160;mine—that weakling Chiron.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus shrugged.&#160;&#34;That weakling destroyed an&#160;entire legion of&#160;telkhines with his arrows.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos swung his scythe and cut a flagpole in&#160;half. The national&#160;colors of Brazil toppled into the&#160;<br/>
army, squashing a&#160;<i>dracaena.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;We will destroy&#160;them!&#34;&#160;Kronos roared. &#34;It is&#160;time to unleash the drakon. Nakamura, you will do&#160;<br/>
this.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Y-yes, lord.&#160;At sunset?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; Kronos said. &#34;Immediately. The defenders&#160;of&#160;Olympus&#160;are badly&#160;wounded. They&#160;will not&#160;<br/>
expect a quick attack. Besides, we know this drakon&#160;they&#160;cannot beat.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan looked&#160;confused. &#34;My lord?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Never you&#160;mind, Nakamura. Just do&#160;my&#160;bidding. I&#160;want Olympus in ruins&#160;by&#160;the time Typhon&#160;<br/>
reaches New York. We will break the gods utterly!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=148></a>&#34;But, my&#160;lord,&#34; Ethan said.&#160;&#34;Your regeneration.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos pointed at Ethan, and the demigod froze.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Does it seem,&#34; Kronos hissed, &#34;that I&#160;<i>need&#160;</i>to regenerate?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan didn't&#160;respond. Kind of hard to&#160;do when&#160;you're immobilized in time.&#160;<br/>
Kronos snapped his fingers and Ethan collapsed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Soon,&#34; the Titan growled, &#34;this form&#160;will be unnecessary.&#160;I will&#160;not rest&#160;with victory so close. Now,&#160;<br/>
go!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan scrambled away.&#160;<br/>
&#34;This is dangerous, my&#160;lord,&#34; Prometheus warned. &#34;Do not be hasty.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hasty?&#160;After festering for three thousand years in&#160;the depths of Tartarus, you call&#160;me hasty? I will&#160;<br/>
slice Percy&#160;Jackson into a thousand pieces.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thrice you've&#160;fought him,&#34; Prometheus pointed out.&#160;&#34;And yet&#160;you've always&#160;said it is beneath the&#160;<br/>
dignity&#160;of a Titan to fight a mere&#160;mortal. I wonder&#160;if&#160;your mortal host is influencing&#160;you, weakening&#160;your&#160;<br/>judgment.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos turned&#160;his golden eyes on&#160;the other Titan. &#34;You call&#160;me&#160;weak?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, my&#160;lord.&#160;I only meant—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are your loyalties divided?&#34; Kronos asked. &#34;Perhaps&#160;you miss your old friends, the gods. Would&#160;you&#160;<br/>
like to join&#160;them?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Prometheus paled. &#34;I misspoke, my&#160;lord.&#160;Your orders&#160;will be carried out.&#34; He turned to the armies and&#160;<br/>
shouted, &#34;PREPARE FOR BATTLE!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The troops began to stir.&#160;<br/>
From&#160;somewhere behind the UN compound, an angry&#160;roar shook the city—the sound of&#160;a drakon&#160;<br/>
waking. The&#160;noise was so&#160;horrible it woke me, and I realized I could still hear it&#160;from&#160;a&#160;mile away.&#160;<br/>
Grover stood&#160;next to me, looking&#160;nervous. &#34;What was&#160;that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;They're coming,&#34; I told&#160;him.&#160;&#34;And we're in trouble.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The Hephaestus cabin was out of Greek fire. The&#160;Apollo cabin and the Hunters were&#160;scrounging for&#160;<br/>arrows. Most of us had already&#160;ingested&#160;so much&#160;ambrosia and nectar we didn't dare take any&#160;more.&#160;<br/>
We had sixteen campers, fifteen Hunters, and half a&#160;dozen satyrs left in fighting shape. The&#160;rest had&#160;<br/>
taken refuge on Olympus. The Party Ponies tried to form&#160;ranks, but they&#160;staggered and giggled and they&#160;<br/>all smelled like root&#160;beer. The Texans were head-butting the Coloradoans. The Missouri&#160;branch was&#160;<br/>arguing with&#160;Illinois. The&#160;chances were&#160;pretty&#160;good&#160;the whole army&#160;would end up fighting each other&#160;<br/>rather than the enemy.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=149></a>Chiron trotted up with Rachel on his back. I felt&#160;a twinge of annoyance because Chiron rarely&#160;gave&#160;<br/>
anyone a ride, and never a&#160;mortal.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your friend&#160;here has some useful insights, Percy,&#34;&#160;he&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
Rachel blushed. &#34;Just some things I saw in my&#160;head.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;A drakon,&#34;&#160;Chiron said. &#34;A&#160;Lydian drakon, to&#160;be exact. The oldest and most dangerous kind.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at her. &#34;How did&#160;you know that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;not sure,&#34; Rachel admitted. &#34;But this&#160;drakon has&#160;a particular fate. It will be killed by a child of&#160;<br/>
Ares.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth crossed her arms. &#34;How&#160;can you possibly&#160;know that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I just saw it. I can't explain.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, let's hope&#160;you're wrong,&#34; I said. &#34;Because&#160;we're a little short on children of Ares.&#160;. . .&#34; A&#160;<br/>
horrible thought occurred to me, and I cursed in Ancient Greek.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The spy,&#34; I told her. &#34;Kronos said,&#160;<i>We&#160;know they cannot beat this drakon.&#160;</i>The spy&#160;has&#160;been&#160;keeping&#160;<br/>
him&#160;updated. Kronos knows the Ares cabin isn't with us.&#160;He intentionally&#160;picked a&#160;monster we can't&#160;kill.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia scowled. &#34;If I ever&#160;catch your spy, he's&#160;going&#160;to be very&#160;sorry. Maybe we could send&#160;another&#160;<br/>
messenger to camp—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I've already&#160;done it,&#34; Chiron said. &#34;Blackjack is on&#160;his way.&#160;But if Silena wasn't&#160;able to convince&#160;<br/>
Clarisse, I doubt Blackjack will be able—&#34;&#160;<br/>
A roar shook&#160;the ground. It&#160;sounded&#160;<i>very&#160;</i>close.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel,&#34; I said, &#34;get inside the building.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I want to stay.&#34;&#160;<br/>
A shadow blotted out&#160;the&#160;sun. Across the street, the&#160;drakon slithered down the&#160;side of a skyscraper. It&#160;<br/>
roared, and a thousand windows shattered.&#160;<br/>
&#34;On second thought,&#34; Rachel said in a small voice, &#34;I'll be inside.&#34;&#160;<br/>
* * *&#160;<br/>
Let&#160;me&#160;explain: there are dragons, and then there are&#160;<i>drakons.</i>&#160;<br/>
Drakons are&#160;several&#160;millennia older than dragons, and&#160;<i>much&#160;&#160;</i>larger. They&#160;look like giant serpents.&#160;<br/>
Most don't have wings. Most don't breathe fire (though some&#160;do). All are poisonous. All are immensely&#160;<br/>strong, with scales harder than titanium.&#160;Their eyes can paralyze you; not the&#160;<i>turn-you~to-stone&#160;</i>Medusa-<br/>type paralysis, but the&#160;<i>oh~my~gods-that~big~snake~is~going~to~eat~me&#160;</i>type of paralysis, which is just&#160;<br/>as bad.&#160;<br/>
We have drakon-fighting&#160;classes&#160;at camp, but there is no way&#160;to&#160;prepare yourself for a two-hundred-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=150></a>foot-long serpent as thick as&#160;a school bus slithering&#160;down the side of a building, its&#160;yellow eyes like&#160;<br/>searchlights and its mouth full of razor-sharp&#160;teeth big enough to chew elephants.&#160;<br/>
It almost&#160;made&#160;me&#160;long for the flying&#160;pig.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, the enemy&#160;army&#160;advanced down Fifth Avenue. We'd&#160;done our&#160;best to push cars out of the&#160;<br/>
way&#160;to keep the&#160;mortals&#160;safe, but that just&#160;made it&#160;easier for our&#160;enemies&#160;to approach. The&#160;Party&#160;Ponies&#160;<br/>swished their tails nervously. Chiron&#160;galloped up and&#160;down their ranks,&#160;shouting encouragement to stand&#160;<br/>tough and think about victory&#160;and root&#160;beer, but I figured any&#160;second they&#160;would panic and run.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll take the&#160;drakon.&#34; My&#160;voice came out as a timid&#160;squeak. Then I yelled louder: &#34;I'LL TAKE THE&#160;<br/>
DRAKON! Everyone else, hold the line&#160;against the army!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth stood next to me. She&#160;had&#160;pulled her owl helmet low over her face, but I could tell&#160;her eyes&#160;<br/>
were red.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Will&#160;you help&#160;me?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's what&#160;I do,&#34; she said miserably.&#160;&#34;I help my&#160;friends.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I felt like a&#160;complete&#160;jerk.&#160;I wanted to&#160;pull her aside&#160;and explain that I didn't mean for Rachel to be&#160;<br/>
here, that it wasn't&#160;my&#160;idea, but we had no time.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Go invisible,&#34; I said. &#34;Look for weak links in its&#160;armor while I keep it busy.&#160;Just&#160;be careful.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I whistled. &#34;Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;heel!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;ROOOF!&#34;&#160;</i>My&#160;hellhound leaped over a line of centaurs and gave&#160;me&#160;a kiss that smelled suspiciously&#160;<br/>
of pepperoni&#160;pizza.&#160;<br/>
I drew&#160;my&#160;sword and we charged the monster.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The drakon&#160;was three&#160;stories above us, slithering sideways&#160;along the building as it sized up&#160;our forces.&#160;<br/>Wherever it looked, centaurs froze in fear.&#160;<br/>
From&#160;the north, the enemy&#160;army&#160;crashed&#160;into the Party&#160;Ponies, and&#160;our lines broke. The drakon lashed&#160;<br/>
out, swallowing three Californian centaurs in&#160;one gulp&#160;before I could even get close.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary launched&#160;herself through the air—a deadly<i>&#160;&#160;</i>black shadow with teeth and claws.&#160;<br/>
Normally, a&#160;pouncing&#160;hellhound is a terrifying sight,&#160;but&#160;next&#160;to the drakon, Mrs. O'Leary&#160;looked like a&#160;<br/>child's&#160;night-night&#160;doll.&#160;<br/>
Her claws raked harmlessly&#160;off the drakon's scales.&#160;She bit the monster's throat but couldn't&#160;make&#160;a&#160;<br/>
dent. Her weight, however, was&#160;enough to knock the&#160;drakon off the side of the building.&#160;It flailed&#160;<br/>awkwardly&#160;and crashed to&#160;the sidewalk, hellhound&#160;and&#160;serpent twisting and thrashing.&#160;The drakon&#160;tried to&#160;<br/>bite Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;but she was too close to&#160;the serpent's&#160;mouth. Poison spewed&#160;everywhere,<b>&#160;&#160;</b>melting&#160;<br/>centaurs into dust along with quite a few&#160;monsters,&#160;but Mrs. O'Leary&#160;weaved&#160;around the serpent's&#160;head,&#160;<br/>scratching and biting.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=151></a>&#34;YAAAH!&#34; I plunged Riptide deep into the&#160;monster's&#160;left&#160;eye. The spotlight went dark. The drakon&#160;<br/>
hissed and reared back to strike, but I rolled aside.&#160;<br/>
It bit a swimming-pool-size chunk out&#160;of the pavement.&#160;It turned&#160;toward me with its good&#160;eye,&#160;and&#160;I&#160;<br/>
focused on its teeth so I&#160;wouldn't get paralyzed. Mrs. O'Leary&#160;did her best to&#160;&#160;cause a distraction. She&#160;<br/>leaped onto the serpent's head and scratched&#160;and growled like a really&#160;angry&#160;black wig.&#160;<br/>
The rest of the battle wasn't going well.<i>&#160;</i>The centaurs had panicked&#160;under the onslaught of&#160;giants and&#160;<br/>
demons. An&#160;occasional orange camp&#160;T-shirt appeared&#160;in the sea of fighting,&#160;but quickly&#160;disappeared.&#160;<br/>Arrows screamed. Fire exploded in&#160;waves across both&#160;armies, but&#160;the action was&#160;moving across the street&#160;<br/>to the entrance of the Empire State Building. We were losing ground.&#160;<br/>
Suddenly Annabeth materialized on the&#160;drakon's back. Her invisibility&#160;cap rolled off&#160;her head as she&#160;<br/>
drove her bronze knife between a chink in the serpent's scales.&#160;<br/>
The drakon roared. It coiled around, knocking Annabeth off its back.&#160;<br/>
I reached her&#160;just as she hit the ground. I&#160;dragged her out of the way&#160;as the serpent rolled, crushing a&#160;<br/>
lamppost right where she'd been.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I&#160;told you to be&#160;careful!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah, well,&#160;DUCK!&#34;&#160;<br/>
It was her turn to save&#160;me. She tackled&#160;me&#160;as the&#160;monster's teeth snapped above my&#160;head. Mrs.&#160;<br/>
O'Leary&#160;body-slammed the drakon's face to get its&#160;attention, and we rolled out&#160;of&#160;the way.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile our allies had retreated to the doors of&#160;the&#160;Empire State Building. The entire enemy army&#160;<br/>
was surrounding them.&#160;<br/>
We were out of options. No&#160;more help was coming.&#160;Annabeth and I would have to retreat before we&#160;<br/>
were cut off from&#160;Mount Olympus.&#160;<br/>
Then I&#160;heard a rumbling in&#160;the south. It&#160;wasn't&#160;a sound&#160;you&#160;hear much in&#160;New York, but I recognized&#160;<br/>
it immediately:&#160;chariot wheels.&#160;<br/>
A girl's&#160;voice&#160;yelled, &#34;ARES!&#34;&#160;<br/>
And a dozen war&#160;chariots charged into battle. Each&#160;flew a red banner with the symbol of the wild&#160;<br/>
boar's head. Each was&#160;pulled by&#160;a team of skeletal&#160;horses with manes of fire. A total of thirty&#160;fresh&#160;<br/>warriors, armor gleaming and eyes full of hate, lowered their lances&#160;as one—making a bristling wall of&#160;<br/>death.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The children&#160;of Ares!&#34; Annabeth said in&#160;amazement. &#34;How did Rachel know?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't have an answer.&#160;But leading the&#160;charge was&#160;a girl in familiar red armor,&#160;her face&#160;covered by&#160;a&#160;<br/>
boar's-head helm. She held aloft a spear that crackled with electricity. Clarisse herself had&#160;come to the&#160;<br/>rescue. While half her chariots charged the monster army, Clarisse led the other six straight for the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=152></a>drakon.&#160;<br/>
The serpent reared back and managed&#160;to throw off&#160;Mrs. O'Leary.&#160;My&#160;poor pet hit the&#160;side of the&#160;<br/>
building with a&#160;yelp. I ran&#160;to help&#160;her, but the serpent&#160;had already&#160;zeroed in on the new threat. Even with&#160;<br/>only&#160;one eye, its glare was enough&#160;to paralyze two chariot drivers. They&#160;veered into a line of cars. The&#160;<br/>other four chariots kept charging. The&#160;monster bared&#160;its fangs to&#160;strike and got a mouthful of Celestial&#160;<br/>bronze javelins.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;EEESSSSS!!!!!&#34;&#160;</i>it screamed, which is probably&#160;drakon&#160;for&#160;<i>OWWWW!</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ares, to&#160;me!&#34; Clarisse&#160;screamed. Her&#160;voice sounded&#160;shriller than usual, but&#160;I guess that wasn't&#160;<br/>
surprising given what she was fighting.&#160;<br/>
Across the street, the arrival of six chariots gave&#160;the&#160;Party&#160;Ponies&#160;new hope. They&#160;rallied at the doors&#160;<br/>
of the Empire&#160;State Building, and the enemy&#160;army&#160;was momentarily thrown into&#160;confusion.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile,&#160;Clarisse's&#160;chariots circled the drakon.&#160;Lances broke&#160;against the&#160;monster's skin. Skeletal&#160;<br/>
horses breathed fire and whinnied. Two&#160;more chariots&#160;overturned,&#160;but the warriors simply&#160;leaped to their&#160;<br/>feet, drew their swords, and went to work. They&#160;hacked at chinks in the creature's&#160;scales.&#160;They&#160;dodged&#160;<br/>poison spray&#160;like they'd&#160;been training for this&#160;all their lives, which of course they had.&#160;<br/>
No one could say&#160;the Ares&#160;campers weren't brave. Clarisse&#160;was right there in front, stabbing her spear&#160;<br/>
at the drakon's face, trying&#160;to put out&#160;its other eye.&#160;But as I&#160;watched, things&#160;started to go wrong. The&#160;<br/>drakon snapped up one Ares camper in a gulp. It knocked aside another and sprayed poison on a third,&#160;<br/>who retreated&#160;in a panic, his armor&#160;melting.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to&#160;help,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>
She was right. I'd just been standing there frozen&#160;in amazement. Mrs. O'Leary tried to&#160;get&#160;up&#160;but&#160;<br/>
yelped again.&#160;One of her paws was bleeding.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Stay&#160;back, girl,&#34; I told&#160;her.&#160;&#34;You've done enough already.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and I jumped onto the monster's back and&#160;ran toward its head, trying to draw its attention&#160;<br/>
away&#160;from&#160;Clarisse.&#160;<br/>
Her&#160;cabinmates threw javelins,&#160;most of&#160;which broke, but some&#160;lodged in the&#160;monster's teeth. It&#160;<br/>
snapped its jaws together until its mouth was a&#160;mess&#160;of green blood,&#160;yellow foamy&#160;poison, and splintered&#160;<br/>weapons.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can do it!&#34; I screamed at Clarisse.&#160;&#34;A child of Ares is destined&#160;to kill it!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Through her war helmet, I&#160;could only see her eyes—but I could tell something was&#160;wrong.&#160;Her blue&#160;<br/>
eyes shone with fear. Clarisse never looked like that.&#160;And she didn't&#160;<i>have</i>&#160;blue eyes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;ARES!&#34; she shouted, in that strangely&#160;shrill voice.<i>&#160;</i>She leveled her spear and charged the drakon.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; I muttered. &#34;WAIT!&#34;&#160;<br/>
But the monster looked down at her—almost in&#160;contempt—and spit poison&#160;directly in&#160;her face.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=153></a>She screamed&#160;and fell.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Clarisse!&#34; Annabeth jumped off the monster's back and ran to help, while the other Ares&#160;campers&#160;<br/>
tried to defend&#160;their fallen&#160;counselor. I drove Riptide&#160;between two of the creature's scales and&#160;managed to&#160;<br/>turn its attention on me.&#160;<br/>
I got thrown&#160;but I landed&#160;on&#160;my&#160;feet. &#34;C'MON, you stupid worm! Look at me!&#34;&#160;<br/>
For the next&#160;several&#160;minutes, all I saw&#160;were teeth.&#160;I retreated and dodged&#160;poison, but&#160;I couldn't&#160;hurt&#160;<br/>
the thing.&#160;<br/>
At the edge of my&#160;vision, I&#160;saw a flying&#160;chariot land on&#160;Fifth Avenue.&#160;<br/>
Then someone ran toward us. A girl's voice, shaken with grief, cried, &#34;NO! Curse you, WHY?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I dared to glance over, but&#160;what I saw&#160;made no sense. Clarisse was lying&#160;on the ground where she'd&#160;<br/>
fallen. Her armor smoked&#160;with poison.&#160;Annabeth and the Ares campers were&#160;trying to unfasten her&#160;<br/>helmet. And&#160;kneeling next&#160;to them, her&#160;face&#160;blotchy with tears,&#160;was&#160;a girl in camp&#160;clothes. It was . . .&#160;<br/>Clarisse.&#160;<br/>
My head spun. Why hadn't I noticed&#160;before? The girl&#160;in Clarisse's&#160;armor was&#160;much thinner, not as&#160;<br/>
tall. But why&#160;would someone pretend to&#160;be Clarisse?&#160;<br/>
I was so stunned, the drakon almost snapped me in&#160;half. I dodged and the&#160;beast buried its&#160;head in a&#160;<br/>
brick wall.&#160;<br/>
&#34;WHY?&#34; The real Clarisse demanded, holding&#160;the other girl in her arms&#160;while the campers struggled&#160;<br/>
to remove the poison-corroded helmet.&#160;<br/>
Chris Rodriguez ran over&#160;from&#160;the flying chariot.&#160;He and Clarisse&#160;must've ridden it&#160;here from&#160;camp,&#160;<br/>
chasing the Ares campers,&#160;who'd&#160;mistakenly&#160;been following the other girl,<i>&#160;</i>thinking she was Clarisse.&#160;But&#160;<br/>it still made no sense.&#160;<br/>
The drakon tugged its head&#160;from&#160;the brick wall and screamed in<i>&#160;</i>rage.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Look out!&#34; Chris&#160;warned.&#160;<br/>
Instead of turning toward&#160;me, the&#160;drakon&#160;whirled&#160;toward&#160;the&#160;sound of Chris's&#160;voice. It bared its fangs&#160;<br/>
at the group&#160;of&#160;demigods.&#160;<br/>
The real Clarisse looked up at the drakon,&#160;her face filled with absolute hate. I'd seen a look that&#160;<br/>
intense only&#160;once before. Her father, Ares, had worn&#160;the same&#160;expression when I'd fought&#160;him&#160;in single&#160;<br/>combat.&#160;<br/>
&#34;YOU WANT DEATH?&#34; Clarisse screamed at the drakon. &#34;WELL, COME ON!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She grabbed&#160;her spear from&#160;the fallen girl. With&#160;no armor or shield, she charged the drakon.&#160;<br/>
I tried to close the distance to help, but&#160;Clarisse&#160;was&#160;faster. She leaped aside&#160;as&#160;the&#160;monster&#160;struck,&#160;<br/>
pulverizing the ground in&#160;front of her. Then she jumped onto the creature's&#160;head. As it reared up, she&#160;<br/>drove her electric spear into its good eye with so much&#160;force it shattered the shaft, releasing all of the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=154></a>magic weapon's power.&#160;<br/>
Electricity&#160;arced across the creature's head, causing its<i>&#160;</i>whole body&#160;to shudder. Clarisse&#160;jumped free,&#160;<br/>
rolling safely to the sidewalk as smoke&#160;boiled from&#160;the drakon's mouth. The drakon's flesh&#160;dissolved, and&#160;<br/>it collapsed into a hollow&#160;scaly&#160;tunnel of armor.&#160;<br/>
The rest of us stared at Clarisse in awe. I had never seen anyone take down&#160;such a huge&#160;monster&#160;<br/>
single-handedly.&#160;But Clarisse didn't&#160;seem&#160;to care.&#160;She ran back to the wounded girl who'd stolen her&#160;<br/>armor.&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;Annabeth&#160;managed to remove&#160;the girl's&#160;helmet. We all&#160;gathered around: the Ares&#160;campers,&#160;<br/>
Chris, Clarisse, Annabeth, and&#160;me. The&#160;battle still raged<i>&#160;</i>along Fifth Avenue, but for that&#160;moment nothing&#160;<br/>existed except our small circle and the fallen girl.&#160;<br/>
Her features, once beautiful, were badly burned&#160;from poison.&#160;I could tell that no&#160;amount of&#160;nectar or&#160;<br/>
ambrosia would save her.&#160;<br/>
<i>Something is&#160;about&#160;to happen.&#160;</i>Rachel's&#160;words rang in my&#160;ears.&#160;<i>A trick that ends in&#160;death.</i>&#160;<br/>
Now I knew what she&#160;meant, and I&#160;knew who had led the Ares cabin into&#160;battle.&#160;<br/>
I looked&#160;down at the dying face of<i>&#160;</i>Silena Beauregard.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
SEVENTEEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;SIT &#160;ON &#160;THE&#160;<br/>
HOT &#160;SEAT&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#34;What were you thinking?&#34; Clarisse&#160;cradled Silena's&#160;head in her lap.&#160;<br/>
Silena tried to&#160;swallow, but her lips were dry&#160;and&#160;cracked. &#34;Wouldn't&#160;. . . listen.&#160;Cabin would . . . only&#160;<br/>
follow you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;So&#160;you stole&#160;my&#160;armor,&#34; Clarisse said in disbelief. &#34;You waited until Chris and I went out&#160;on patrol;&#160;<br/>
you stole my&#160;armor and pretended to be&#160;me.&#34; She glared at her siblings. &#34;And NONE of you&#160;noticed?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Ares campers developed a sudden&#160;interest in their combat boots.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't blame&#160;them,&#34; Silena said. &#34;They&#160;wanted to . . .&#160;to believe I&#160;was you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You&#160;<i>stupid&#160;</i>Aphrodite girl,&#34; Clarisse sobbed. &#34;You charged a drakon?&#160;<i>Why?</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;All&#160;my&#160;fault,&#34; Silena said, a tear streaking the side&#160;of&#160;her face. &#34;The drakon, Charlie's death . . . camp&#160;<br/>
endangered—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=155></a>&#34;Stop it!&#34; Clarisse said. &#34;That's not true.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena opened her hand.&#160;In&#160;her palm&#160;was a silver bracelet with a scythe charm,&#160;the mark of Kronos.&#160;<br/>
A cold fist closed<i>&#160;</i>around&#160;my&#160;heart. &#34;You were the spy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Silena tried to nod. &#34;Before . . . before I liked Charlie, Luke was nice to&#160;me. He&#160;was so . . . charming.&#160;<br/>
Handsome. Later, I wanted&#160;to stop helping him,&#160;but he&#160;threatened to tell. He promised . . . he promised&#160;I&#160;<br/>was saving lives. Fewer people would&#160;get hurt. He told&#160;me&#160;he&#160;wouldn't hurt . .&#160;.&#160;Charlie. He lied to me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I&#160;met&#160;Annabeth's&#160;eyes. Her&#160;face&#160;was chalky. She looked like somebody&#160;had just&#160;yanked the world out&#160;<br/>
from&#160;under her feet.&#160;<br/>
Behind us, the battle raged.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse scowled at her cabinmates. &#34;Go,&#160;help the centaurs. Protect the doors. GO!&#34;&#160;<br/>
They&#160;scrambled off to join&#160;the fight.&#160;<br/>
Silena took a&#160;heavy,&#160;painful breath. &#34;Forgive me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're not dying,&#34;&#160;Clarisse insisted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Charlie . . .&#34;&#160;Silena's eyes were a&#160;million miles away. &#34;See Charlie&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
She didn't speak again.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse held her and wept. Chris put a hand on&#160;her shoulder.&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;Annabeth closed Silena's eyes.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We have to&#160;fight.&#34; Annabeth's&#160;voice was brittle. &#34;She&#160;gave her life to help&#160;us. We have to&#160;honor&#160;<br/>
her.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Clarisse sniffled and wiped&#160;her nose.&#160;&#34;She&#160;was&#160;a hero, understand?&#160;A hero.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded. &#34;Come on, Clarisse.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She picked up&#160;a sword from&#160;one of her fallen siblings. &#34;Kronos is going&#160;to pay.&#34;&#160;<br/>
* * *&#160;<br/>
I'd like to say I drove the enemy&#160;away&#160;from&#160;the Empire&#160;State Building. The truth&#160;was Clarisse&#160;did all the&#160;<br/>work. Even&#160;without her armor or spear, she was&#160;a demon. She rode her&#160;chariot straight into&#160;the Titan's&#160;<br/>army&#160;and crushed everything in&#160;her path.&#160;<br/>
She was so inspiring, even the panicked centaurs&#160;started to rally. The Hunters&#160;scrounged arrows from&#160;<br/>
the fallen and&#160;launched volley&#160;after volley&#160;into&#160;the enemy.&#160;The Ares&#160;cabin slashed and hacked, which was&#160;<br/>their favorite thing. The monsters&#160;retreated toward 35th Street.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse&#160;drove to the&#160;drakon's carcass and looped a&#160;grappling&#160;line through its&#160;eye sockets. She lashed&#160;<br/>
her horses and took off, dragging the drakon behind&#160;the chariot like a Chinese New Year&#160;dragon. She&#160;<br/>charged after&#160;the enemy,&#160;yelling insults and daring&#160;them&#160;to cross&#160;her. As&#160;she&#160;rode, I realized she&#160;was&#160;<br/>literally&#160;glowing. An aura&#160;of&#160;red fire flickered around&#160;her.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=156></a>&#34;The blessing of Ares,&#34; Thalia said. &#34;I've never seen it&#160;in person&#160;before.&#34;&#160;<br/>
For the&#160;moment, Clarisse&#160;was&#160;as&#160;invincible as&#160;I was.&#160;The enemy&#160;threw&#160;spears&#160;and arrows, but&#160;nothing&#160;<br/>
hit her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I AM CLARISSE, DRAKON-SLAYER!&#34; she&#160;yelled. &#34;I&#160;will&#160;kill&#160;you ALL! Where is Kronos? Bring&#160;<br/>
him&#160;out! Is he a coward?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Clarisse!&#34; I yelled.&#160;&#34;Stop&#160;it. Withdraw!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's the&#160;matter, Titan&#160;lord?&#34; she&#160;yelled. &#34;BRING&#160;IT ON!&#34;&#160;<br/>
There was no&#160;answer from&#160;the&#160;enemy.&#160;Slowly, they&#160;began to fall back behind a&#160;<i>dracaenae&#160;&#160;</i>shield&#160;<br/>
wall, while&#160;Clarisse drove in circles around Fifth&#160;Avenue, daring anyone to cross her path. The two-<br/>hundred-foot-long drakon&#160;carcass&#160;made a hollow scraping noise against the pavement, like a thousand&#160;<br/>knives.&#160;<br/>
Meanwhile, we tended our wounded,&#160;bringing&#160;them&#160;inside the lobby. Long&#160;after the enemy&#160;had&#160;<br/>
retreated from sight, Clarisse kept riding up and&#160;down&#160;the avenue with her horrible trophy,&#160;demanding&#160;<br/>that Kronos&#160;meet her battle.&#160;<br/>
Chris said, &#34;I'll watch her. She'll get tired eventually.&#160;I'll&#160;make sure&#160;she comes inside.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What about the camp?&#34; I asked. &#34;Is anybody left there?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chris shook his head. &#34;Only Argus and the nature spirits. Peleus the dragon is still guarding the&#160;tree.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;They won't last long,&#34; I said. &#34;But I'm&#160;glad&#160;you came.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chris nodded sadly. &#34;I'm&#160;sorry&#160;it took so long. I tried&#160;to reason with Clarisse. I&#160;said there's no point in&#160;<br/>
defending camp if you&#160;guys&#160;die. All our friends&#160;are here. I'm&#160;sorry&#160;it took Silena . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;My&#160;Hunters will help you stand guard,&#34; Thalia&#160;said. &#34;Annabeth and Percy, you should go to&#160;<br/>
Olympus. I have a feeling they'll need&#160;you up&#160;there—to set up the final defense.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The doorman&#160;had disappeared from&#160;the lobby.&#160;His book&#160;was facedown on the desk and his chair was&#160;<br/>empty.&#160;The rest of the lobby, however,&#160;was jam-packed with wounded campers,&#160;Hunters, and satyrs.&#160;<br/>
Connor and&#160;Travis Stoll met us by&#160;the elevators.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is it true?&#34; Connor asked.&#160;&#34;About Silena?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I nodded.&#160;&#34;She&#160;died a hero.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Travis shifted uncomfortably. &#34;Um,&#160;I also&#160;heard—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's it,&#34; I insisted. &#34;End&#160;of story.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Right,&#34; Travis&#160;mumbled.&#160;&#34;Listen, we figure&#160;the&#160;Titan's army&#160;will have trouble getting up the&#160;<br/>
elevator. They'll have to&#160;go up a few at a time.&#160;And the giants won't be able to fit at all.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's our biggest advantage,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>I said. &#34;Any&#160;way&#160;to disable the elevator?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=157></a>&#34;It's&#160;magic,&#34;&#160;Travis said. &#34;Usually&#160;you&#160;need a key&#160;card, but the doorman vanished. That&#160;means the&#160;<br/>
defenses are&#160;crumbling. Anyone can walk into&#160;the elevator now and head straight up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then we have to keep them&#160;away&#160;from&#160;the doors,&#34; I said. &#34;We'll bottle them&#160;up in&#160;the lobby.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We need reinforcements,&#34;&#160;Travis said. &#34;They'll just&#160;keep coming. Eventually&#160;they'll overwhelm&#160;us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;There are no reinforcements,&#34; Connor complained.&#160;<br/>
I looked outside at Mrs. O'Leary,&#160;who&#160;was breathing against the glass doors and smearing them&#160;with&#160;<br/>
hellhound drool.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Maybe that's&#160;not true,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
I went outside&#160;and put&#160;a hand on&#160;Mrs.&#160;O'Leary&#160;s&#160;muzzle. Chiron&#160;had bandaged&#160;her paw, but&#160;she was&#160;<br/>
still limping. Her fur was&#160;matted with mud, leaves, pizza slices, and&#160;dried monster blood.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey,&#160;girl.&#34; I&#160;tried to sound&#160;upbeat.&#160;&#160;&#34;I know&#160;you're&#160;tired, but&#160;I've got one more big favor to&#160;ask&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>I leaned next to her and whispered in her ear.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
After Mrs. O'Leary&#160;shadow-traveled away, I rejoined Annabeth&#160;in the lobby.&#160;On the way to&#160;the elevator,&#160;<br/>we spotted Grover kneeling over a fat wounded satyr.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Leneus!&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
The old satyr&#160;looked&#160;terrible. His lips were blue. There was a broken spear in his belly, and&#160;his furry&#160;<br/>
goat legs were twisted&#160;at a&#160;painful angle.&#160;<br/>
He tried to focus on us, but&#160;I don't think&#160;he saw us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Grover?&#34; he&#160;murmured.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;here, Leneus.&#34; Grover was blinking&#160;back tears, despite all the horrible things Leneus&#160;had said&#160;<br/>
about him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Did . . .&#160;did&#160;we win?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um&#160;. . .&#160;yes,&#34; Grover lied.&#160;&#34;Thanks to&#160;you, Leneus.&#160;We drove the&#160;enemy&#160;away.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Told&#160;you,&#34;&#160;the old satyr&#160;mumbled. &#34;True leader. True . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
He closed his&#160;eyes for the last time.&#160;<br/>
Grover gulped. He put his hand on Leneus's forehead and spoke&#160;an ancient blessing. The old satyr's&#160;<br/>
body melted, until all that&#160;was left was&#160;a tiny&#160;sapling m&#160;a pile of fresh soil.&#160;<br/>
&#34;A laurel,&#34; Grover said in&#160;awe. &#34;Oh, that lucky&#160;old goat.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He gathered&#160;up the sapling in his&#160;hands. &#34;I . . .&#160;I should plant&#160;him.&#160;In Olympus, in&#160;the gardens.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We're going&#160;that way,&#34; I said. &#34;Come on.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Easy-listening&#160;music played as the elevator rose. I&#160;thought about the first time I'd visited Mount&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=158></a>Olympus, back when I was twelve. Annabeth and Grover&#160;hadn't been with me then. I was glad they&#160;were&#160;<br/>with me now. I had a feeling it might&#160;be our last adventure together.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth said quietly.&#160;&#34;You were right about Luke.&#34;&#160;It&#160;was the first time&#160;she'd spoken since&#160;<br/>
Silena Beauregard's&#160;death. She kept her eyes fixed on&#160;the elevator&#160;floors as they&#160;blinked into the&#160;magical&#160;<br/>numbers: 400, 450, 500.&#160;<br/>
Grover and I&#160;exchanged glances.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;I'm&#160;sorry—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You tried to tell&#160;me.&#34; Her voice was shaky.&#160;&#34;Luke is no good. I&#160;didn't believe you until . .&#160;. until I&#160;<br/>
heard how he'd used Silena.&#160;Now I know.&#160;I hope&#160;you're happy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That doesn't&#160;make&#160;me happy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She put her&#160;head against the elevator wall and wouldn't look at me.&#160;<br/>
Grover cradled his laurel sapling in his hands. &#34;Well&#160;. . . sure good to&#160;be together again. Arguing.&#160;<br/>
Almost dying. Abject terror. Oh, look. It's&#160;our floor.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The doors dinged and we stepped onto the aerial walkway.&#160;<br/>
<i>Depressing&#160;</i>is not a word that usually&#160;describes Mount Olympus, but it looked that way&#160;now. No fires&#160;<br/>
lit the braziers. The windows were dark. The streets&#160;were deserted and the doors were&#160;barred. The only&#160;<br/>movement was in the parks, which had been set up&#160;as field hospitals. Will Solace and the other Apollo&#160;<br/>campers scrambled around, caring for the wounded.&#160;Naiads&#160;and&#160;dryads tried to help, using&#160;nature&#160;magic&#160;<br/>songs to heal&#160;burns and&#160;poison.&#160;<br/>
As Grover planted the laurel sapling, Annabeth and&#160;I&#160;went around&#160;trying&#160;to&#160;cheer up the wounded.&#160;I&#160;<br/>
passed a satyr<i>&#160;</i>with a broken leg, a demigod who was bandaged from&#160;head to toe, and a body&#160;covered in&#160;<br/>the golden&#160;burial shroud of&#160;Apollo's&#160;cabin. I didn't know who was underneath. I didn't want to find out.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;heart felt like lead, but&#160;we tried to find positive things to say.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You'll be up&#160;and fighting&#160;Titans in no time!&#34; I told one camper.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You look&#160;great,&#34; Annabeth told another&#160;camper.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Leneus turned into a shrub!&#34;&#160;Grover told a groaning&#160;satyr.&#160;<br/>
I found Dionysus's&#160;son Pollux propped up against a tree. He had&#160;a broken arm,&#160;but otherwise he was&#160;<br/>
okay.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I can still fight with the other hand,&#34;&#160;he said, gritting&#160;his teeth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;You've done enough. I want&#160;you&#160;to stay&#160;here and help with the wounded.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Promise&#160;me to stay&#160;safe,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Okay?&#160;Personal favor.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He frowned uncertainly. It&#160;wasn't&#160;like we were good&#160;friends or anything,&#160;but I wasn't&#160;going to tell him&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=159></a>it was a request from&#160;his dad. That would just embarrass him.&#160;Finally he promised, and when he sat back&#160;<br/>down, I could&#160;tell he was kind of relieved.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth, Grover, and I kept walking toward the&#160;palace. That's where Kronos&#160;would head. As soon&#160;<br/>
as he&#160;made it up the elevator—and I had no&#160;doubt&#160;he&#160;would, one&#160;way&#160;or another—he would destroy&#160;the&#160;<br/>throne room, the center of the gods'&#160;power.&#160;<br/>
The bronze doors creaked open. Our&#160;footsteps echoed on the&#160;marble floor. The constellations&#160;<br/>
twinkled coldly&#160;on the ceiling of the great hall. The&#160;hearth was down to a dull&#160;red glow. Hestia, in the&#160;<br/>form of a little girl in brown robes, hunched at its&#160;edge, shivering. The Ophiotaurus swam&#160;sadly&#160;in his&#160;<br/>sphere of water. He let out a&#160;half-hearted&#160;moo when he saw&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
In the firelight, the thrones cast evil-looking shadows,&#160;like grasping&#160;hands.&#160;<br/>
Standing at the foot of Zeus's&#160;throne, looking&#160;up&#160;at the stars,&#160;was Rachel&#160;Elizabeth Dare.&#160;She was&#160;<br/>
holding a Greek ceramic vase.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel?&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Um,&#160;what are you&#160;doing with that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She focused on me&#160;as if she were&#160;coming out&#160;of a&#160;dream.&#160;&#34;I found it. It's&#160;Pandora's jar, isn't it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her eyes were brighter than usual, and I had&#160;a bad flashback of moldy&#160;sandwiches and burned&#160;<br/>
cookies.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Please put down the jar,&#34;&#160;I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I can see Hope inside it.&#34;<i>&#160;</i>Rachel ran her fingers over the ceramic&#160;designs. &#34;So fragile.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Rachel.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
My voice seemed to bring&#160;her back to reality. She&#160;held&#160;out the&#160;jar,&#160;and I took it.&#160;The clay felt&#160;as cold&#160;<br/>
as ice.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Grover,&#34; Annabeth mumbled. &#34;Let's scout around&#160;the palace. Maybe we can find some&#160;extra Greek&#160;<br/>
fire or Hephaestus traps.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth elbowed him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Right!&#34; he&#160;yelped. &#34;I love&#160;traps!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She dragged&#160;him&#160;out of the throne room.&#160;<br/>
Over by the fire, Hestia&#160;was huddled in&#160;her robes, rocking&#160;back and forth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come on,&#34; I&#160;told Rachel. &#34;I<i>&#160;</i>want you to&#160;meet someone.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We sat next to the goddess.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Lady Hestia,&#34;&#160;I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hello, Percy Jackson,&#34; the goddess&#160;murmured. &#34;Getting colder. Harder to keep the fire going.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;The Titans are near.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=160></a>Hestia focused on Rachel.&#160;&#34;Hello, my&#160;dear.&#160;You've come to our hearth at last.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel blinked. &#34;You've been expecting&#160;me?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hestia held out her hands, and the coals glowed. I&#160;saw images&#160;in the fire: My&#160;mother, Paul, and I&#160;<br/>
eating Thanksgiving dinner at the kitchen table;&#160;my&#160;friends and&#160;me&#160;around the campfire at Camp&#160;Half-<br/>Blood, singing songs and roasting marshmallows; Rachel and me&#160;driving along the beach in Paul's&#160;Prius.&#160;<br/>
I didn't know&#160;if Rachel saw the same&#160;images, but&#160;the tension went out of&#160;her&#160;shoulders. The warmth&#160;<br/>
of the fire seemed to spread&#160;across her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;To claim&#160;your place at the hearth,&#34; Hestia told her,&#160;&#34;you&#160;must let go of&#160;your distractions. It is the&#160;<br/>
only&#160;way&#160;you will survive.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel nodded. &#34;I . .&#160;. I understand.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Wait,&#34; I said. &#34;What is she talking about?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel took a shaky&#160;breath. &#34;Percy, when I came here . . . I thought I was coming for you. But I&#160;<br/>
wasn't. You and me&#160;. . .&#34; She shook&#160;her head.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Wait. Now I'm&#160;a&#160;<i>distraction</i>?<i>&#160;</i>Is this&#160;because I'm&#160;'not&#160;the hero' or whatever?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm not sure&#160;I can put it into words,&#34; she said.&#160;&#34;I&#160;was&#160;drawn to you because . .&#160;. because&#160;you&#160;opened&#160;<br/>
the door to all of this.&#34; She gestured at&#160;the throne&#160;room. &#34;I needed to understand my&#160;true sight. But&#160;you&#160;<br/>and me, that&#160;wasn't&#160;part of it. Our fates aren't&#160;intertwined. I think&#160;you've always&#160;known that, deep down.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at her. Maybe I wasn't&#160;the brightest guy&#160;in&#160;the world when&#160;it came&#160;to&#160;girls, but I was pretty&#160;<br/>
sure Rachel had just dumped me, which&#160;was lame&#160;considering we'd never even&#160;been together.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So . .&#160;. what,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>I said. '&#34;Thanks for bringing me&#160;to Olympus. See ya.'&#160;Is that what&#160;you're saying?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel stared&#160;at the fire.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34; Hestia said. &#34;Rachel has told&#160;you all she can. Her moment&#160;is coming, but&#160;your&#160;<br/>
decision approaches even&#160;more&#160;rapidly.&#160;Are you prepared?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to complain that no, I&#160;wasn't even close to prepared.&#160;<br/>
I looked at Pandora's jar, and for the first time I had&#160;an urge to&#160;open it. Hope seemed pretty&#160;useless to&#160;<br/>
me right now. So many&#160;of&#160;my&#160;friends&#160;were dead. Rachel was cutting me&#160;off. Annabeth was angry&#160;with&#160;<br/>me. My&#160;parents were asleep down in&#160;the streets&#160;somewhere&#160;while a&#160;monster army&#160;surrounded the&#160;<br/>building. Olympus was on&#160;the verge of failing, and I'd seen&#160;so&#160;many&#160;cruel things the gods had done: Zeus&#160;<br/>destroying Maria di<i>&#160;</i>Angelo, Hades&#160;cursing the last Oracle,&#160;Hermes turning his back on Luke even when&#160;<br/>he knew his son would become evil.&#160;<br/>
<i>Surrender,&#160;&#160;</i>Prometheus's&#160;voice whispered in my&#160;ear.&#160;<i>Otherwise your home will be destroyed. Your&#160;</i><br/>
<i>precious camp will burn.</i>&#160;<br/>
Then I looked at Hestia. Her red eyes glowed warmly. I remembered the images I'd seen in her&#160;<br/>
hearth—friends and family, everyone I cared about.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=161></a>I remembered something&#160;Chris Rodriguez had said:&#160;<i>There's no point in&#160;defending camp if&#160;you guys&#160;</i><br/>
<i>die. All our friends are here.&#160;</i>And Nico, standing up&#160;to his father, Hades:&#160;<i>If Olympus falls,&#160;</i>he<i>&#160;</i>said,&#160;<i>your&#160;</i><br/>
<i>own palace's&#160;safety doesn't&#160;matter.</i>&#160;<br/>
I heard footsteps. Annabeth and&#160;Grover came&#160;back&#160;into the throne&#160;room&#160;and stopped when&#160;they saw&#160;<br/>
us. I probably had a pretty&#160;strange look&#160;on my&#160;face.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy?&#34; Annabeth didn't sound&#160;angry<i>&#160;</i>anymore—just concerned. &#34;Should&#160;we, um, leave again?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Suddenly I felt like someone had injected me&#160;with steel. I understood what to&#160;do.&#160;<br/>
I<i>&#160;</i>looked at Rachel. &#34;You're not going&#160;to&#160;do anything&#160;stupid, are you? I mean . . . you talked to&#160;Chiron,&#160;<br/>
right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She managed&#160;a faint smile. &#34;You're worried about&#160;<i>me&#160;</i>doing&#160;something stupid?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But I mean . . . will&#160;you be okay?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know,&#34; she admitted. &#34;That kind&#160;of depends on&#160;whether&#160;you save the world, hero.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I picked up&#160;Pandora's jar.&#160;The spirit of&#160;Hope fluttered inside, trying&#160;to warm&#160;the cold container.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hestia,&#34; I said, &#34;I give this&#160;to&#160;you as an&#160;offering.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The goddess tilted her head. &#34;I am&#160;the least of the gods. Why&#160;would&#160;you trust me with this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're the last Olympian,&#34; I said. &#34;And&#160;the most important.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And why&#160;is that, Percy&#160;Jackson?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Because&#160;Hope survives best at the hearth,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;Guard it for&#160;me, and I won't be tempted to give&#160;<br/>
up again.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The goddess smiled. She took the jar in her hands and it began&#160;to&#160;glow. The hearth fire burned a little&#160;<br/>
brighter.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well done,&#160;Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34; she said. &#34;May&#160;the gods&#160;bless you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We're about to find&#160;out.&#34;&#160;I&#160;looked at&#160;Annabeth and Grover. &#34;Come on,&#160;guys.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I marched toward&#160;my&#160;father's throne.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The seat of Poseidon stood just to the&#160;right of Zeus's, but it wasn't&#160;nearly&#160;as grand. The molded black&#160;<br/>leather seat&#160;was&#160;attached&#160;to a swivel&#160;pedestal, with a couple of iron rings on the side for fastening&#160;a&#160;<br/>fishing pole (or a trident). Basically&#160;it looked like a chair on a deep-sea boat, that you would sit in if&#160;you&#160;<br/>wanted to hunt shark or marlin or sea&#160;monsters.&#160;<br/>
Gods in their natural state are about twenty feet tall, so I could just reach the edge of&#160;the&#160;seat if I&#160;<br/>
stretched my&#160;arms.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Help&#160;me&#160;up,&#34; I told Annabeth and Grover.&#160;<br/>
&#34;'Are you crazy?&#34;&#160;Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=162></a>&#34;Probably,&#34; I&#160;admitted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Grover said, &#34;the&#160;gods&#160;<i>really&#160;&#160;</i>don't appreciate people sitting in&#160;their&#160;thrones. I mean like&#160;<br/>
turn-you-into-a-pile-of-ashes don't appreciate it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I need to get&#160;his attention,&#34; I said. &#34;It's the only&#160;way.&#34;&#160;<br/>
They&#160;exchanged uneasy looks.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;this'll get his attention.&#34;&#160;<br/>
They&#160;linked their arms to&#160;make&#160;a&#160;step, then boosted me&#160;onto the throne. I felt like a baby&#160;with&#160;my&#160;feet&#160;<br/>
so high&#160;off the ground. I looked around&#160;at the other gloomy,&#160;empty thrones, and I could imagine what it&#160;<br/>would&#160;be like sitting&#160;on the Olympian Council—so much power but&#160;so much arguing, always&#160;eleven&#160;<br/>other gods trying to&#160;get their way.&#160;It would&#160;be easy&#160;to&#160;get paranoid, to look&#160;out&#160;only&#160;for my&#160;own interest,&#160;<br/>especially&#160;if I&#160;were Poseidon. Sitting in his throne, I&#160;felt like I had the entire sea at my&#160;command—vast&#160;<br/>cubic miles&#160;of ocean churning with&#160;power and mystery.&#160;Why should Poseidon listen to anyone? Why&#160;<br/>shouldn't he be&#160;the greatest&#160;of the twelve?&#160;<br/>
Then I shook&#160;my&#160;head.&#160;<i>Concentrate.</i>&#160;<br/>
The throne rumbled. A wave of gale-force anger slammed into my&#160;mind:&#160;<br/>
<i>WHO DARES—</i>&#160;<br/>
The voice stopped abruptly. The anger retreated,&#160;which was a good thing,&#160;because just&#160;those two&#160;<br/>
words had almost blasted my&#160;mind to shreds.&#160;<br/>
<i>Percy.&#160;</i>My&#160;father's&#160;voice&#160;was still&#160;angry&#160;but more controlled.&#160;<i>What</i>—<i>exactly</i>—<i>are&#160;you doing on my&#160;</i><br/>
<i>throne?</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;sorry, Father,&#34; I said. &#34;I&#160;needed to get your attention.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>This was a very dangerous thing&#160;to&#160;do. Even for you.&#160;If I&#160;hadn't&#160;looked before I blasted, you would&#160;</i><br/>
<i>now be a&#160;puddle of seawater.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;sorry,&#34; I&#160;said again. &#34;Listen, things are rough&#160;up here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I told him&#160;what was happening. Then I told him&#160;my&#160;plan.&#160;<br/>
His voice was silent for a long time.&#160;<br/>
<i>Percy, what you ask is impossible. My palace</i>—&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dad, Kronos sent an army&#160;against you on&#160;purpose. He wants&#160;to divide&#160;you from&#160;the other gods&#160;<br/>
because he knows you could tip the scales.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Be that as it&#160;may, he attacks my home.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;<i>at&#160;</i>your&#160;home,&#34; I said. &#34;Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The floor shook. A wave of anger washed over&#160;my&#160;mind. I thought I'd gone&#160;too far, but then the&#160;<br/>
trembling eased. In the background of&#160;my&#160;mental link,&#160;I&#160;heard underwater explosions and&#160;the sound&#160;of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=163></a>battle cries: Cyclopes bellowing, mermen shouting.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is Tyson okay?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
The question seemed to take&#160;my&#160;dad&#160;by&#160;surprise.&#160;<i>He's fine. Doing much&#160;better than I&#160;expected.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Though &#34;peanut butter&#34; is a strange battle cry.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;You let him&#160;fight?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Stop changing the subject! You realize what you are&#160;asking me to&#160;do? My palace will be destroyed.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;And Olympus might be saved.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Do you have any idea&#160;how long I've worked on remodeling this palace? The game room alone took&#160;</i><br/>
<i>six hundred years.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dad—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Very well!&#160;It&#160;shall be as you say. But my son, pray this works.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;I am&#160;praying. I'm&#160;talking to&#160;you, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Oh . . . yes. Good&#160;point. Amphitrite</i>—<i>incoming!</i>&#160;<br/>
The sound&#160;of&#160;a large explosion shattered our connection.&#160;<br/>
I slipped down from&#160;the throne.&#160;<br/>
Grover studied me&#160;nervously. &#34;Are&#160;you&#160;okay?&#160;You turned pale and&#160;. . .&#160;you started smoking.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I did not!&#34;&#160;Then I looked at&#160;my&#160;arms. Steam was&#160;curling off my&#160;shirtsleeves. The hair on&#160;my&#160;arms&#160;<br/>
was singed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;If you'd sat&#160;there any&#160;longer,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;you&#160;would've spontaneously&#160;combusted. I&#160;hope the&#160;<br/>
conversation was worth it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>Moo,&#160;</i>said the Ophiotaurus&#160;in his sphere&#160;of water.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll find out soon,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Just then the doors of the throne room&#160;swung open.&#160;Thalia&#160;marched in. Her bow&#160;was snapped in half&#160;<br/>
and her quiver was empty.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You've got to&#160;get down&#160;there,&#34; she told us. &#34;The&#160;enemy&#160;is advancing. And Kronos is leading them.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
EIGHTEEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
MY &#160;PARENTS &#160;GO&#160;<br/>
COMMANDO&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=164></a>&#160;<br/>
By&#160;the time&#160;we got to the&#160;street, it was too late.&#160;<br/>
Campers and&#160;Hunters lay&#160;wounded on&#160;the ground.&#160;Clarisse&#160;must've lost a fight with a Hyperborean&#160;<br/>
giant, because she and her chariot were frozen in a block of ice. The centaurs were nowhere&#160;to be seen.&#160;<br/>Either they'd&#160;panicked and&#160;ran or they'd&#160;been disintegrated.&#160;<br/>
The Titan army&#160;ringed the building,&#160;standing maybe twenty&#160;feet from&#160;the doors. Kronos's&#160;vanguard&#160;<br/>
was in the lead: Ethan Nakamura, the&#160;<i>dracaena&#160;</i>queen&#160;in her green&#160;armor, and two Hyperboreans. I didn't&#160;<br/>see Prometheus. The slimy weasel was probably hiding&#160;back at their headquarters. But Kronos himself&#160;<br/>stood right in&#160;front with&#160;his scythe in&#160;hand.&#160;<br/>
The only&#160;thing standing&#160;in&#160;his way&#160;was . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;Chiron,&#34; Annabeth said, her voice trembling.&#160;<br/>
If Chiron heard us, he didn't&#160;answer. He&#160;had an&#160;arrow notched, aimed straight at Kronos's&#160;face.&#160;<br/>
As soon as&#160;Kronos saw&#160;me, his gold eyes flared. Every&#160;muscle in&#160;my&#160;body&#160;froze. Then the Titan lord&#160;<br/>
turned his attention back to&#160;Chiron. &#34;Step aside, little son.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hearing Luke call Chiron his&#160;<i>son&#160;</i>was weird enough, but Kronos&#160;put contempt in his voice, like&#160;<i>son&#160;</i><br/>
was the worst word he could think of.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;afraid not.&#34; Chiron's tone was steely&#160;calm,&#160;the way&#160;he gets when he's&#160;really&#160;angry.&#160;<br/>
I tried to move, but my&#160;feet felt like concrete. Annabeth, Grover,&#160;and Thalia were straining too, like&#160;<br/>
they were just as stuck.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Chiron!&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Look&#160;out!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The&#160;&#160;<i>dracaena&#160;</i>queen became impatient and charged. Chiron's arrow flew straight between her eyes&#160;<br/>
and she vaporized on the spot, her empty&#160;armor clattering to the asphalt.&#160;<br/>
Chiron reached for another arrow, but his quiver was&#160;empty.&#160;He dropped the bow and drew his sword.&#160;<br/>
I knew he hated fighting with a sword.&#160;It&#160;was never his favorite weapon.&#160;<br/>
Kronos chuckled. He advanced a&#160;step, and Chiron's horse-half skittered nervously. His tail flicked&#160;<br/>
back and forth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're a teacher,&#34; Kronos sneered. &#34;Not a hero.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke was a hero,&#34; Chiron said. &#34;He was a good one,&#160;until&#160;<i>you&#160;</i>corrupted him.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;FOOL!&#34; Kronos's&#160;voice shook the city.&#160;&#34;You filled&#160;his head with empty&#160;promises. You said the gods&#160;<br/>
cared about me!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Me,&#34; Chiron noticed. &#34;You said&#160;<i>me.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos looked confused, and in that&#160;moment,&#160;Chiron struck.&#160;It was a good maneuver—a feint&#160;<br/>
followed by&#160;a strike to the face.&#160;I couldn't have done&#160;better&#160;myself, but Kronos was quick. He had all&#160;of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=165></a>Luke's&#160;fighting skill, which was a lot. He knocked aside Chiron's blade and&#160;yelled,&#160;<i>&#34;BACK!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
A<i>&#160;</i>blinding white light exploded between the Titan and&#160;the centaur. Chiron flew into the side of the&#160;<br/>
building with such force the wall crumbled and collapsed on top&#160;of&#160;him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; Annabeth wailed. The freezing<i>&#160;</i>spell broke.&#160;We ran toward&#160;our teacher, but there was no sign&#160;<br/>
of him.&#160;Thalia and I pulled helplessly at the bricks&#160;while a ripple&#160;of ugly laughter ran through the Titan's&#160;<br/>army.&#160;<br/>
&#34;YOU!&#34; Annabeth turned&#160;on Luke. &#34;To&#160;think that I . . . that I thought—&#34;&#160;<br/>
She drew her knife.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth, don't.&#34; I tried to&#160;take her arm,&#160;but she shook me&#160;off.&#160;<br/>
She attacked&#160;Kronos, and his smug smile faded. Perhaps some&#160;part of Luke remembered that he used&#160;<br/>
to like this girl, used to take care of her&#160;when she was little. She plunged her knife between&#160;the straps of&#160;<br/>his armor, right at his collar bone. The blade should've sunk into his chest. Instead it bounced off.&#160;<br/>Annabeth doubled&#160;over, clutching&#160;her arm&#160;to her stomach. The jolt&#160;might've been enough to&#160;dislocate her&#160;<br/>bad shoulder.&#160;<br/>
I yanked her&#160;back as Kronos swung his&#160;scythe, slicing the air where she'd been standing.&#160;<br/>
She fought me and screamed, &#34;I HATE&#160;you!&#34; I wasn't&#160;sure who she was talking to—me or Luke or&#160;<br/>
Kronos. Tears streaked the dust on her face.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I have to fight him,&#34; I told her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's&#160;my&#160;fight&#160;too, Percy!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos laughed. &#34;So much&#160;spirit. I can see&#160;why&#160;Luke&#160;wanted to spare you. Unfortunately, that won't&#160;<br/>
be possible.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He raised his scythe. I got&#160;ready&#160;to&#160;defend, but&#160;before Kronos could strike, a dog's howl pierced the&#160;<br/>
air somewhere behind the&#160;Titan's army.&#160;<i>&#34;Arroooooooo!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
It was too much to hope, but I called, &#34;Mrs. O'Leary?&#34;&#160;<br/>
The enemy&#160;forces stirred&#160;uneasily. Then&#160;the strangest&#160;thing happened. They&#160;began to part, clearing a&#160;<br/>
path through&#160;the street like something behind them&#160;was forcing them&#160;to.&#160;<br/>
Soon there was a free aisle down the center of Fifth&#160;Avenue. Standing at the end of the&#160;block was&#160;my&#160;<br/>
giant dog, and a small figure in black armor.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nico?&#34; I called.&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;ROWWF!&#34;&#160;&#160;</i>Mrs. O'Leary&#160;bounded toward&#160;me, ignoring the growling monsters on either side. Nico&#160;<br/>
strode forward. The enemy&#160;army&#160;fell back before him&#160;like he radiated death, which of course he did.&#160;<br/>
Through the face guard of his skull-shaped helmet,&#160;he smiled. &#34;Got your message. Is it too late to&#160;<br/>
join the&#160;party?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=166></a>&#34;Son of&#160;Hades.&#34; Kronos spit on the ground. &#34;Do&#160;you&#160;love death so&#160;much you wish to experience it?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your death,&#34;&#160;Nico said, &#34;would be great for me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;immortal,&#160;you fool! I&#160;have escaped&#160;Tartarus.&#160;You have no business here, and no chance to live.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Nico drew his sword—three feet of wicked sharp Stygian iron,&#160;black as a nightmare. &#34;I don't agree.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The ground rumbled. Cracks appeared m&#160;the road, the&#160;sidewalks,&#160;the sides of the buildings.&#160;Skeletal&#160;<br/>
hands grasped the air as the dead clawed&#160;their way into&#160;the world&#160;of the living.&#160;There were thousands of&#160;<br/>them, and as they&#160;emerged, the Titan's&#160;monsters got jumpy&#160;and started to back up.&#160;<br/>
&#34;HOLD YOUR GROUND!&#34; Kronos demanded. &#34;The dead are no match for us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The sky turned dark and&#160;cold. Shadows thickened. A harsh war horn sounded, and as the dead&#160;<br/>
soldiers formed up ranks with their guns and swords and spears,&#160;an enormous&#160;chariot roared down Fifth&#160;<br/>Avenue. It came to a stop next to Nico. The horses&#160;were living shadows, fashioned from&#160;darkness. The&#160;<br/>chariot was&#160;inlaid with obsidian and gold, decorated&#160;with scenes&#160;of&#160;painful death. Holding the reins&#160;was&#160;<br/>Hades himself, Lord of&#160;the&#160;Dead, with Demeter and Persephone riding behind him.&#160;<br/>
Hades wore black armor and a cloak the&#160;color of fresh&#160;blood. On top of his pale&#160;head was the&#160;helm&#160;of&#160;<br/>
darkness: a crown that radiated pure terror. It changed shape&#160;as I&#160;watched—from a dragon's head to&#160;a&#160;<br/>circle of black&#160;flames&#160;to a&#160;wreath of human bones. But that wasn't&#160;the scary&#160;part. The helm&#160;reached into&#160;<br/>my&#160;mind and ignited my&#160;worst nightmares,&#160;my&#160;most&#160;secret fears. I wanted to&#160;crawl into a&#160;hole and hide,&#160;<br/>and I could tell the enemy army&#160;felt the same&#160;way.&#160;Only&#160;Kronos's power and authority&#160;kept his ranks&#160;<br/>from&#160;fleeing.&#160;<br/>
Hades smiled&#160;coldly. &#34;Hello, Father. You're looking .&#160;. .&#160;young.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hades,&#34; Kronos growled.&#160;&#34;I hope&#160;you and the ladies&#160;have come&#160;to pledge&#160;your allegiance.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;afraid not.&#34; Hades sighed. &#34;My&#160;son here convinced&#160;me&#160;that perhaps I should prioritize my&#160;list of&#160;<br/>
enemies.&#34; He&#160;glanced at&#160;me with distaste. &#34;As&#160;much&#160;as I dislike&#160;certain&#160;<i>upstart&#160;</i>demigods, it would not do&#160;<br/>for Olympus to fall. I would miss bickering with&#160;my&#160;siblings. And if&#160;there is one&#160;thing we agree on—it is&#160;<br/>that&#160;you were a TERRIBLE father.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;True,&#34; muttered Demeter.&#160;&#34;No appreciation of agriculture.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mother!&#34; Persephone complained.&#160;<br/>
Hades drew&#160;his sword, a&#160;double-edged&#160;Stygian blade&#160;etched&#160;with silver. &#34;Now fight me! For today&#160;<br/>
the House of Hades will be called the saviors of Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't have&#160;time for this,&#34; Kronos snarled.&#160;<br/>
He struck the ground with his scythe.&#160;A crack spread in both directions, circling the Empire State&#160;<br/>
Building. A wall of force shimmered&#160;along the fissure line, separating Kronos's vanguard,&#160;my&#160;friends,&#160;<br/>and me&#160;from&#160;the bulk&#160;of the two armies.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's he doing?&#34; I muttered.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=167></a>&#34;Sealing us in,&#34; Thalia said. &#34;He's collapsing&#160;the magic barriers&#160;around Manhattan—cutting off just&#160;<br/>
the building,&#160;and<b>&#160;</b>us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Sure enough, outside the&#160;barrier, car engines revved to life.&#160;Pedestrians&#160;woke up and stared&#160;<br/>
uncomprehendingly at the monsters and&#160;zombies all&#160;around them. No telling what they&#160;saw through the&#160;<br/>Mist, but&#160;I'm&#160;sure it was plenty scary.&#160;Car doors opened.&#160;And at&#160;the end of&#160;the&#160;block, Paul&#160;Blofis and my&#160;<br/>mom got out&#160;of their Prius.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;Don't . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;mother could see through the Mist. I could tell from&#160;her expression that she understood how&#160;<br/>
serious things&#160;were. I hoped she would have the&#160;sense to run. But she locked eyes with me, said&#160;<br/>something to&#160;Paul, and they&#160;ran straight&#160;toward us.&#160;<br/>
I couldn't call out. The last thing I wanted&#160;to&#160;do&#160;was bring her to&#160;Kronos's&#160;attention.&#160;<br/>
Fortunately,&#160;Hades&#160;caused a distraction. He charged&#160;at the wall&#160;of force, but his chariot&#160;crashed&#160;<br/>
against it and overturned.&#160;He got to his feet, cursing,&#160;and blasted the wall with&#160;black energy. The barrier&#160;<br/>held.&#160;<br/>
&#34;ATTACK!&#34; he&#160;roared.&#160;<br/>
The armies of&#160;the dead clashed with&#160;the&#160;Titan's&#160;monsters. Fifth Avenue exploded into&#160;absolute&#160;chaos.&#160;<br/>
Mortals screamed and ran for cover.&#160;Demeter waved&#160;her hand and an entire&#160;column&#160;of giants turned into a&#160;<br/>wheat field. Persephone changed the&#160;<i>dracaenae's&#160;&#160;</i>spears into sunflowers. Nico&#160;slashed and hacked his&#160;<br/>way&#160;through&#160;the enemy,&#160;trying&#160;to&#160;protect the pedestrians as best he could.&#160;My&#160;parents ran toward me,&#160;<br/>dodging monsters and zombies, but there was nothing&#160;I could&#160;do to&#160;help them.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nakamura,&#34;&#160;Kronos said. &#34;Attend me. Giants—deal&#160;with them.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He pointed at my&#160;friends and me. Then he ducked into&#160;the lobby.&#160;<br/>
For a second I was&#160;stunned. I'd been&#160;expecting a fight, but Kronos completely&#160;ignored me&#160;like I&#160;<br/>
wasn't&#160;worth the trouble. That made&#160;me mad.&#160;<br/>
The first Hyperborean giant smashed&#160;at&#160;me with&#160;his club. I rolled between&#160;his legs and&#160;stabbed&#160;<br/>
Riptide into&#160;his backside. He shattered into&#160;a pile&#160;of ice shards. The second giant&#160;breathed frost at&#160;<br/>Annabeth, who was barely&#160;able to stand, but Grover pulled her out&#160;of the way&#160;while Thalia went to work.&#160;<br/>She sprinted&#160;up the giant's back like a gazelle, sliced&#160;her hunting knives across&#160;his monstrous blue neck,&#160;<br/>and created the world's largest headless&#160;ice sculpture.&#160;<br/>
I glanced outside the magic barrier. Nico was fighting his way&#160;toward&#160;my&#160;mom&#160;and Paul,&#160;but they&#160;<br/>
weren't waiting for help.&#160;Paul grabbed a sword from a fallen hero and did<i>&#160;&#160;</i>a pretty&#160;fine job keeping&#160;a&#160;<br/>
<i>dracaena&#160;</i>busy. He stabbed her in the gut,&#160;and she disintegrated.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Paul?&#34; I said in amazement.&#160;<br/>
He turned toward&#160;me&#160;and grinned.&#160;&#34;I&#160;hope that&#160;was a monster I just killed. I&#160;was a Shakespearian&#160;<br/>
actor in college! Picked up a little swordplay!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=168></a>I liked him&#160;even better for that, but then a Laistrygonian giant charged toward&#160;my&#160;mom.&#160;She was&#160;<br/>
rummaging around in&#160;an abandoned&#160;police car—maybe&#160;looking for the emergency&#160;radio—and her back&#160;<br/>was turned.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mom!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>
She whirled when the&#160;monster was almost on top&#160;of her.&#160;&#160;I thought the thing in her hands was&#160;an&#160;<br/>
umbrella&#160;until she cranked the pump and the shotgun&#160;blast&#160;blew the giant twenty&#160;feet backward, right into&#160;<br/>Nico's sword.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nice one,&#34; Paul said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;When did&#160;you learn to fire a shotgun?&#34; I&#160;demanded.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;mom&#160;blew the hair out&#160;of her face. &#34;About&#160;two seconds ago. Percy,&#160;we'll be fine. Go!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#34; Nico agreed,<i>&#160;</i>&#34;we'll&#160;handle the army. You have&#160;to get Kronos!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Come on, Seaweed Brain!&#34; Annabeth said. I nodded. Then I looked at the rubble pile on the side of&#160;<br/>
the building.&#160;My&#160;heart twisted. I'd forgotten about Chiron. How could I do&#160;that?&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mrs. O'Leary,&#34; I said. &#34;Please,&#160;Chiron's under there.&#160;If anyone can dig him out, you can. Find him!&#160;<br/>
Help him!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I'm not sure&#160;how much&#160;she understood, but she bounded to the pile and started to dig. Annabeth,&#160;<br/>
Thalia, Grover, and I raced for the elevators.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
NINETEEN&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
WE &#160;TRASH &#160;THE&#160;<br/>
ETERNAL &#160;CITY&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The bridge to Olympus was dissolving. We stepped&#160;out&#160;of the elevator onto the white&#160;marble walkway,&#160;<br/>and immediately&#160;cracks appeared at our feet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Jump!&#34; Grover said, which was easy&#160;for him&#160;since he's part&#160;mountain goat.&#160;<br/>
He sprang to the next slab&#160;of stone while ours tilted sickeningly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Gods, I hate heights!&#34; Thalia yelled as&#160;she and I leaped. But Annabeth was in&#160;no shape for jumping.&#160;<br/>
She stumbled&#160;and&#160;yelled, &#34;Percy!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I caught her&#160;hand as the pavement fell,&#160;crumbling into&#160;dust. For a&#160;second I thought she was going to&#160;<br/>
pull us&#160;both over.&#160;Her feet dangled in&#160;the open air. Her hand started to slip&#160;until&#160;I was holding&#160;her only&#160;by&#160;<br/>her fingers. Then Grover and Thalia grabbed my&#160;legs, and I found&#160;extra strength. Annabeth was&#160;<i>not&#160;</i>going&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=169></a>to fall.&#160;<br/>
I pulled her&#160;up&#160;and we lay trembling&#160;on&#160;the pavement. I didn't&#160;realize<i>&#160;</i>we had our arms&#160;around each&#160;<br/>
other until&#160;she suddenly&#160;tensed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;thanks,&#34; she muttered.&#160;<br/>
I tried to say&#160;<i>Don't mention it,&#160;</i>but it came out as, &#34;Uh duh.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Keep&#160;moving!&#34; Grover tugged my&#160;shoulder. We untangled ourselves and sprinted across the sky&#160;<br/>
bridge as more stones disintegrated and fell into oblivion. We made it to the edge of the mountain just as&#160;<br/>the final section collapsed.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth looked back at the elevator, which was now completely&#160;out of reach—a polished set of&#160;<br/>
metal doors hanging in&#160;space, attached to&#160;nothing, six hundred stories above Manhattan.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We're&#160;marooned,&#34; she said. &#34;On our&#160;own.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Blah-ha-ha!&#34; Grover said.&#160;&#34;The connection between&#160;Olympus and America is&#160;dissolving. If it fails—<br/>
&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The gods won't&#160;move on to another&#160;country&#160;this&#160;time,&#34; Thalia said. &#34;This will be the end of&#160;<br/>
Olympus. The&#160;<i>final&#160;</i>end.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We ran through streets. Mansions were&#160;burning.&#160;Statues had been hacked&#160;down. Trees in the parks&#160;<br/>
were blasted to splinters. It&#160;looked like someone&#160;had attacked the city with a giant Weedwacker.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Kronos's&#160;scythe,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
We followed the winding path toward the palace of&#160;the gods. I&#160;didn't remember the road&#160;being so&#160;<br/>
long. Maybe&#160;Kronos was&#160;making time go slower,&#160;or&#160;maybe it&#160;was just dread slowing&#160;me down. The&#160;<br/>whole mountaintop was in&#160;ruins—so many&#160;beautiful&#160;buildings and&#160;gardens gone.&#160;<br/>
A few&#160;minor gods&#160;and&#160;nature spirits had tried to&#160;stop Kronos.&#160;What remained of them&#160;was strewn&#160;<br/>
about the road: shattered armor, ripped&#160;clothing,&#160;swords and spears broken in&#160;half.&#160;<br/>
Somewhere&#160;ahead of us, Kronos's&#160;voice roared: &#34;Brick&#160;by&#160;brick! That was&#160;my&#160;promise. Tear&#160;it down&#160;<br/>
BRICK BY&#160;BRICK!&#34;&#160;<br/>
A white&#160;marble temple&#160;with a gold dome suddenly&#160;exploded. The dome shot up like the lid of a teapot&#160;<br/>
and shattered into a billion&#160;pieces,&#160;raining rubble over&#160;the city.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That was a shrine to Artemis,&#34; Thalia grumbled. &#34;He'll pay&#160;for that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
We were running under the&#160;marble archway&#160;with the huge statues of Zeus and&#160;Hera&#160;when the entire&#160;<br/>
mountain groaned, rocking&#160;sideways&#160;like a boat in a storm.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Look&#160;out!&#34;&#160;Grover yelped. The archway&#160;crumbled. I looked&#160;up in&#160;time to see&#160;a twenty-ton&#160;scowling&#160;<br/>
Hera topple over on us.&#160;Annabeth and I would've been flattened, but&#160;Thalia shoved us from&#160;behind and&#160;<br/>we landed just out of&#160;danger.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thalia!&#34; Grover cried.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=170></a>When the dust cleared and the&#160;mountain stopped rocking, we found her still alive, but her legs were&#160;<br/>
pinned under the&#160;statue.&#160;<br/>
We tried desperately&#160;to move it, but&#160;it&#160;would've taken several Cyclopes. When&#160;we tried to pull Thalia&#160;<br/>
out from&#160;under it, she yelled in pain.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I survive all&#160;those battles,&#34; she growled, &#34;and I get&#160;defeated by&#160;a stupid chunk&#160;of&#160;rock!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's Hera,&#34; Annabeth said in outrage. &#34;She's&#160;had it in&#160;for&#160;me&#160;all year. Her&#160;statue&#160;would've killed&#160;me&#160;if&#160;<br/>
you&#160;hadn't pushed us away.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia grimaced. &#34;Well, don't just&#160;stand there! I'll be fine. Go!&#34;&#160;<br/>
We didn't want to leave her, but I could&#160;hear&#160;Kronos laughing as he approached&#160;the hall of the gods.&#160;<br/>
More buildings exploded.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We'll be back,&#34; I promised.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;not going&#160;anywhere,&#34; Thalia groaned.&#160;<br/>
A fireball erupted on the side of the mountain, right near the gates of the palace.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We've got to run,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't suppose you mean&#160;<i>away</i>,&#34;<i>&#160;</i>Grover murmured hopefully.&#160;<br/>
I sprinted toward the palace, Annabeth right behind me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I was afraid&#160;of that,&#34; Grover&#160;sighed, and&#160;clip-clopped&#160;after us.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The doors of&#160;the palace were big enough to steer a cruise ship through, but&#160;they'd&#160;been ripped off their&#160;<br/>hinges and smashed like they&#160;weighed&#160;nothing. We&#160;had to climb over a huge&#160;pile of broken stone and&#160;<br/>twisted&#160;metal&#160;to get inside.&#160;<br/>
Kronos stood in the middle of the throne room, his arms wide, staring at the starry ceiling as if&#160;taking&#160;<br/>
it all in. His laughter echoed even louder than it had from&#160;the pit of Tartarus.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Finally!&#34; he&#160;bellowed. &#160;&#34;The Olympian Council—so proud and mighty.&#160;Which&#160;seat of power&#160;shall I&#160;<br/>
destroy&#160;first?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan Nakamura stood to&#160;one side, trying to stay&#160;out of the way&#160;of his master's scythe. The hearth&#160;<br/>
was almost dead, just a few coals glowing deep in&#160;the ashes. Hestia&#160;was nowhere&#160;to be seen. Neither was&#160;<br/>Rachel. I hoped she was okay,&#160;but&#160;I'd seen so much&#160;destruction I was afraid to think&#160;about it. The&#160;<br/>Ophiotaurus swam in his&#160;water&#160;sphere&#160;in the far corner of the room,&#160;wisely&#160;not&#160;making a&#160;sound, but it&#160;<br/>wouldn't be long&#160;before Kronos noticed him.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth, Grover, and I stepped forward into&#160;the torchlight.&#160;Ethan&#160;saw us first.&#160;<br/>
&#34;My lord,&#34; he&#160;warned.&#160;<br/>
Kronos turned&#160;and smiled through Luke's&#160;face. Except&#160;for the&#160;golden eyes, he looked just the&#160;same as&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=171></a>he had four&#160;years ago when he'd&#160;welcomed&#160;me&#160;into&#160;the Hermes cabin. Annabeth made a painful sound in&#160;<br/>the back of her throat, like&#160;someone had just sucker punched her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Shall I destroy&#160;you first, Jackson?&#34; Kronos asked. &#34;Is that the choice you will&#160;make—to fight me&#160;and&#160;<br/>
die instead of bowing&#160;down? Prophecies never end well,&#160;you&#160;know.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke would&#160;fight with a sword,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;But I suppose you don't have his skill.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos sneered. His scythe began to&#160;change, until he&#160;held Luke's&#160;old weapon, Backbiter, with its&#160;<br/>
half-steel, half-Celestial bronze blade.&#160;<br/>
Next to&#160;me,&#160;Annabeth gasped like she'd&#160;suddenly&#160;had an idea. &#34;Percy, the blade!&#34; She unsheathed her&#160;<br/>
knife.&#160;<i>&#34;The hero's&#160;soul, cursed blade shall reap.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
I didn't understand why&#160;she was reminding me&#160;of that prophecy&#160;line right now. It wasn't&#160;exactly&#160;a&#160;<br/>
morale booster, but before&#160;I could say&#160;anything, Kronos raised his sword.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Wait!&#34; Annabeth&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
Kronos came&#160;at&#160;me&#160;like a&#160;whirlwind.&#160;<br/>
My&#160;instincts took over. I dodged and slashed and rolled, but I felt like I was fighting a hundred&#160;<br/>
swordsmen.&#160;Ethan ducked to&#160;one side, trying to&#160;get behind me&#160;until Annabeth intercepted him.&#160;They&#160;<br/>started to fight, but I couldn't focus on how she was doing. I was vaguely&#160;aware of Grover playing his&#160;<br/>reed pipes. The sound filled&#160;me&#160;with warmth and&#160;courage—thoughts of sunlight and a blue sky&#160;and a&#160;<br/>calm&#160;meadow, somewhere&#160;far away&#160;from&#160;the&#160;war.&#160;<br/>
Kronos backed me up against the throne of Hephaestus—a huge mechanical La-Z-Boy type thing&#160;<br/>
covered with bronze and silver gears. Kronos slashed, and I managed to jump&#160;straight up onto the seat.&#160;<br/>The throne whirred and hummed with secret&#160;mechanisms.&#160;<i>Defense mode,&#160;</i>it warned.&#160;<i>Defense mode.</i>&#160;<br/>
That couldn't&#160;be good. I jumped straight over Kronos's head&#160;as the&#160;throne shot tendrils of electricity&#160;in&#160;<br/>
all directions. One hit Kronos in the face, arcing down&#160;his body and&#160;up his sword.&#160;<br/>
&#34;ARG!&#34; He&#160;crumpled to his knees and dropped Backbiter.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth saw her chance. She kicked Ethan out&#160;of the way&#160;and charged Kronos. &#34;Luke, listen!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I wanted to shout&#160;at her, to&#160;tell her she&#160;was crazy&#160;for trying to reason with Kronos,&#160;but&#160;there was no&#160;<br/>
time. Kronos flicked his&#160;hand. Annabeth flew backward, slamming into&#160;the throne of her&#160;mother and&#160;<br/>crumpling to&#160;the floor.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth!&#34; I&#160;screamed.&#160;<br/>
Ethan Nakamura got to&#160;his feet. He now stood&#160;between Annabeth and&#160;me. I couldn't fight&#160;him&#160;<br/>
without turning my&#160;back on&#160;Kronos.&#160;<br/>
Grover's&#160;music took on&#160;a more urgent tune. He&#160;moved toward Annabeth, but&#160;he&#160;couldn't go any&#160;faster&#160;<br/>
and keep&#160;up the song. Grass grew on the floor&#160;of the throne room. Tiny&#160;roots crept up between the cracks&#160;<br/>of the marble&#160;stones.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=172></a>Kronos rose to one knee.&#160;His hair smoldered. His&#160;face was covered with electrical burns. He reached&#160;<br/>
for his sword,&#160;but this time&#160;it didn't fly&#160;into his hands.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nakamura!&#34;&#160;he groaned. &#34;Time to prove yourself. You know Jackson's&#160;secret weakness.&#160;Kill him,&#160;<br/>
and&#160;you will&#160;have rewards&#160;beyond measure.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan's eyes dropped to&#160;my&#160;midsection, and I was sure&#160;that he knew. Even if he couldn't&#160;kill&#160;me&#160;<br/>
himself, all he had to do&#160;was tell Kronos. There was no&#160;way&#160;I could&#160;defend myself forever.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Look around&#160;you,&#160;Ethan,&#34; I said. &#34;The end of the world. Is this the reward you want? Do&#160;you really&#160;<br/>
want everything destroyed—the good with the bad?&#160;<i>Everything?</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover was almost to Annabeth now. The grass thickened on the floor. The roots were almost a foot&#160;<br/>
long, like a stubble of whiskers.&#160;<br/>
&#34;There is no throne to Nemesis,&#34; Ethan&#160;muttered. &#34;No throne to my mother.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's right!&#34; Kronos tried to&#160;get up,&#160;but stumbled. Above his left ear, a patch of blond&#160;hair still&#160;<br/>
smoldered. &#34;Strike them&#160;down! They&#160;deserve to suffer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You said your&#160;mom is the goddess of&#160;balance,&#34; I&#160;reminded him. &#34;The&#160;minor&#160;gods deserve&#160;better,&#160;<br/>
Ethan, but&#160;total destruction isn't&#160;<i>balance.&#160;</i>Kronos doesn't&#160;build. He only&#160;destroys.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Ethan looked at the sizzling throne of Hephaestus.&#160;Grover's&#160;music&#160;kept playing,&#160;and Ethan swayed to&#160;<br/>
it, as if the song were filling him&#160;with nostalgia—a wish&#160;to see a beautiful day,&#160;to be anywhere but here.&#160;<br/>His good eye&#160;blinked.&#160;<br/>
Then he charged . . .&#160;but&#160;not at me.&#160;<br/>
While Kronos was still on&#160;his knees, Ethan brought&#160;down&#160;his sword on the&#160;Titan lord's&#160;neck. It should&#160;<br/>
have killed him&#160;instantly,&#160;but the blade shattered.&#160;Ethan fell back, grasping his stomach.&#160;A&#160;shard of his&#160;<br/>own blade had ricocheted and pierced his armor.&#160;<br/>
Kronos rose unsteadily, towering over his servant. &#34;Treason,&#34; he snarled.&#160;<br/>
Grover's&#160;music kept playing, and&#160;grass grew around&#160;Ethan's body. Ethan stared at me, his face tight&#160;<br/>
with pain.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Deserve better,&#34; he gasped. &#34;If they&#160;just&#160;. . .&#160;had thrones—&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos stomped his foot,&#160;and the floor&#160;ruptured&#160;around Ethan Nakamura. The son of Nemesis fell&#160;<br/>
through a fissure that went straight through the heart of&#160;the mountain—straight into open air.&#160;<br/>
&#34;So much for him.&#34; Kronos picked up&#160;his sword. &#34;And now for the rest of you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
My&#160;only thought was to keep him&#160;away&#160;from&#160;Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
Grover was at her side now. He'd&#160;stopped playing and was feeding her ambrosia.&#160;<br/>
Everywhere&#160;Kronos stepped, the roots&#160;wrapped around his feet, but Grover had&#160;stopped his&#160;magic too&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=173></a>early. The roots weren't thick or strong&#160;enough&#160;to do&#160;much&#160;more than annoy&#160;the Titan.&#160;<br/>
We fought through the hearth, kicking up&#160;coals&#160;and&#160;sparks. Kronos slashed an&#160;armrest off the throne&#160;<br/>
of Ares, which was okay&#160;by&#160;me, but then he backed&#160;me up to my&#160;dad's throne.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh,&#160;yes,&#34; Kronos said. &#34;This one will&#160;make fine kindling for my&#160;new hearth!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Our blades clashed in a shower of sparks. He was&#160;stronger than&#160;me, but for the moment I felt the&#160;<br/>
power of the&#160;ocean in my&#160;arms. I pushed him&#160;back and struck&#160;again—slashing Riptide across his&#160;<br/>breastplate so&#160;hard I cut a gash in the Celestial bronze.&#160;<br/>
He stamped&#160;his foot again and time&#160;slowed. I tried to attack but I was&#160;moving at the speed of a&#160;<br/>
glacier. Kronos backed up leisurely,&#160;catching his breath. He&#160;examined the gash in his armor&#160;while&#160;I&#160;<br/>struggled forward, silently cursing him.&#160;He could take all the time-outs he wanted. He could&#160;freeze&#160;me&#160;in&#160;<br/>place at will.&#160;My&#160;only hope was that the effort was draining him.&#160;If I could wear him&#160;down . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's too late, Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34; he said. &#34;Behold.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He pointed to the hearth, and the coals glowed. A&#160;sheet of white smoke poured from the fire, forming&#160;<br/>
images like an Iris-message. I saw Nico&#160;and my&#160;parents down on Fifth Avenue, fighting a hopeless battle,&#160;<br/>ringed in enemies. In the&#160;background Hades fought&#160;from&#160;his black chariot, summoning wave after&#160;wave&#160;<br/>of zombies out of the ground, but the forces of the Titan's army&#160;seemed just&#160;as endless.&#160;Meanwhile,&#160;<br/>Manhattan was being destroyed. Mortals, now fully&#160;awake, were running&#160;in terror. Cars swerved and&#160;<br/>crashed.&#160;<br/>
The scene shifted, and I saw something even more&#160;terrifying.&#160;<br/>
A column&#160;of storm&#160;was&#160;approaching&#160;the Hudson River,&#160;moving rapidly&#160;over the Jersey&#160;shore.&#160;<br/>
Chariots circled it, locked in combat with&#160;the creature in the cloud.&#160;<br/>
The gods&#160;attacked. Lightning flashed. Arrows of gold&#160;and silver streaked into the cloud&#160;like&#160;rocket&#160;<br/>
tracers&#160;and exploded. Slowly, the cloud ripped apart, and I saw Typhon clearly for the first time.&#160;<br/>
I knew as long as I lived (which might not be that long) I would never be able to get the image out of&#160;<br/>
my&#160;mind. Typhon's head&#160;shifted constantly. Every&#160;moment he was a different monster,&#160;each&#160;more&#160;<br/>horrible than the last. Looking at his face would've&#160;driven me insane, so I&#160;focused on his&#160;body, which&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;much better. He&#160;was humanoid, but his skin reminded&#160;me&#160;of a&#160;meat loaf sandwich that had been in&#160;<br/>someone's&#160;locker all&#160;year. He was&#160;mottled green, with blisters the size of buildings, and&#160;blackened&#160;<br/>patches from&#160;eons of being&#160;stuck under&#160;a volcano. His&#160;hands were human, but with&#160;talons like an eagle's.&#160;<br/>His legs were&#160;scaly&#160;and reptilian.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The Olympians are giving their final effort.&#34; Kronos laughed. &#34;How pathetic.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Zeus threw a&#160;thunderbolt from&#160;his chariot. The blast&#160;lit up the world. I could feel the shock even here&#160;<br/>
on Olympus, but&#160;when the dust cleared, Typhon was still standing. He staggered a bit, with a smoking&#160;<br/>crater on top&#160;of his misshapen head, but&#160;he&#160;roared in&#160;anger and kept advancing.&#160;<br/>
My limbs began to loosen&#160;up.&#160;Kronos&#160;didn't seem&#160;to notice. His attention was focused on&#160;the fight&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=174></a>and his final&#160;victory.&#160;If I could&#160;hold&#160;out&#160;a few&#160;more&#160;seconds, and if&#160;my&#160;dad kept&#160;his word . . .&#160;<br/>
Typhon stepped into the Hudson River and barely&#160;sank to midcalf.&#160;<br/>
Now, I thought, imploring&#160;the image in the smoke.&#160;<i>Please, it has to&#160;happen now.</i>&#160;<br/>
Like a&#160;miracle, a conch horn sounded&#160;from&#160;the&#160;smoky&#160;picture. The call of the ocean. The call of&#160;<br/>
Poseidon.&#160;<br/>
All around Typhon, the Hudson River erupted, churning with forty-foot waves.&#160;Out of the water burst&#160;<br/>
a new&#160;chariot—this one pulled by&#160;massive hippocampi, who swam in air as easily&#160;as in water. My&#160;father,&#160;<br/>glowing&#160;with&#160;a blue aura&#160;of power, rode&#160;a defiant circle around the giant's legs. Poseidon&#160;was no longer&#160;<br/>an old&#160;man.&#160;He looked like himself&#160;again—tan and strong with a&#160;black beard.&#160;As he swung&#160;his trident, the&#160;<br/>river responded, making a funnel cloud&#160;around the monster.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; Kronos&#160;bellowed after a&#160;moment of stunned silence. &#34;NO!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;NOW, MY&#160;BRETHREN!&#34; Poseidon's voice was&#160;so loud I&#160;wasn't&#160;sure if I&#160;was hearing it from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
smoke image&#160;or from&#160;all the way&#160;across town. &#34;STRIKE FOR OLYMPUS!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Warriors burst out of the river, riding the waves on&#160;huge sharks and dragons and sea horses.&#160;It was a&#160;<br/>
legion of Cyclopes, and leading them&#160;into&#160;battle was . . .&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tyson!&#34; I&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
I knew he couldn't hear&#160;me, but I stared at him&#160;in&#160;amazement. He'd&#160;magically&#160;grown in size. He had&#160;<br/>
to be thirty&#160;feet tall, as big as any&#160;of his older cousins, and for the first time he&#160;was wearing full battle&#160;<br/>armor. Riding behind&#160;him&#160;was Briares, the Hundred-Handed One.&#160;<br/>
All the Cyclopes held huge lengths of black iron&#160;chains—big enough to anchor a battleship—with&#160;<br/>
grappling hooks at the ends. They&#160;swung them&#160;like&#160;lassos&#160;and began to ensnare Typhon, throwing lines&#160;<br/>around the creature's legs&#160;and arms, using the tide to&#160;keep circling, slowly&#160;tangling him.&#160;Typhon shook&#160;<br/>and roared and&#160;yanked at&#160;the chains, pulling some&#160;of the Cyclopes off their mounts; but there were too&#160;<br/>many&#160;chains.&#160;The sheer weight of&#160;the&#160;Cyclops&#160;battalion&#160;began to&#160;weigh Typhon down. Poseidon threw&#160;<br/>his trident and impaled the&#160;monster in the throat. Golden blood, immortal ichor, spewed from the wound,&#160;<br/>making a waterfall taller than a skyscraper.&#160;The trident flew back to Poseidon's hand.&#160;<br/>
The other gods struck with renewed force. Ares rode&#160;in and stabbed Typhon in the nose. Artemis shot&#160;<br/>
the monster in&#160;the eye with a dozen silver arrows.&#160;Apollo shot&#160;a blazing volley of arrows and set the&#160;<br/>monster's loincloth on fire. And Zeus&#160;kept pounding&#160;the giant with lightning, until finally,&#160;slowly, the&#160;<br/>water rose, wrapping Typhon like a cocoon, and he&#160;began to sink&#160;under the weight of&#160;the chains. Typhon&#160;<br/>bellowed in&#160;agony,&#160;thrashing with such force that&#160;waves sloshed the Jersey&#160;shore, soaking five-story&#160;<br/>buildings and&#160;splashing over the George Washington&#160;Bridge—but down&#160;he&#160;went as&#160;my&#160;dad opened&#160;a&#160;<br/>special tunnel for him&#160;at the bottom&#160;of&#160;the river—an&#160;endless&#160;waterslide that&#160;would take him straight to&#160;<br/>Tartarus. The giant's head went under&#160;in a seething whirlpool, and&#160;he was gone.&#160;<br/>
&#34;BAH!&#34; Kronos screamed.&#160;He slashed his sword through the smoke, tearing the image to shreds.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=175></a>&#34;They're on their way,&#34; I said. &#34;You've lost.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I haven't even started.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He advanced&#160;with blinding&#160;speed. Grover—brave, stupid satyr&#160;that he was—tried to protect&#160;me, but&#160;<br/>
Kronos tossed him&#160;aside like a rag doll.&#160;<br/>
I sidestepped&#160;and jabbed under Kronos's guard. It was a good trick. Unfortunately, Luke knew it. He&#160;<br/>
countered the strike and&#160;disarmed&#160;me&#160;using&#160;one&#160;of&#160;the first moves he'd&#160;ever taught me. My&#160;sword&#160;<br/>skittered across the ground and fell straight into&#160;the open fissure.&#160;<br/>
&#34;STOP!&#34; Annabeth came from&#160;nowhere.&#160;<br/>
Kronos whirled to face her and slashed with Backbiter, but somehow Annabeth caught the strike on&#160;<br/>
her dagger hilt. It was a&#160;move only&#160;the quickest and&#160;most skilled&#160;knife fighter could've&#160;managed. Don't&#160;<br/>ask me where&#160;she found the strength,&#160;but she stepped&#160;in&#160;closer for leverage, their blades crossed, and for a&#160;<br/>moment she stood face-to-face with the Titan lord,&#160;holding&#160;him&#160;at a standstill.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Luke,&#34; she said, gritting her teeth, &#34;I&#160;understand now. You have to trust me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Kronos roared in outrage. &#34;Luke Castellan is dead! His body&#160;will&#160;burn away&#160;as I assume&#160;my&#160;true&#160;<br/>
form!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I tried to&#160;move, but my&#160;body&#160;was frozen again.&#160;How could Annabeth, battered and half dead with&#160;<br/>
exhaustion, have the strength to fight a Titan like Kronos?&#160;<br/>
Kronos pushed against her, trying to dislodge his blade, but she held him&#160;in check, her arms&#160;trembling&#160;<br/>
as he forced his sword down toward her&#160;neck.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Your mother,&#34; Annabeth grunted. &#34;She saw your fate.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Service to Kronos!&#34; the Titan roared. &#34;This is my&#160;fate.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No!&#34; Annabeth insisted. Her eyes were tearing up,&#160;but I didn't&#160;know if it was from&#160;sadness or pain.&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's not the end, Luke.&#160;The prophecy: she saw what&#160;you would&#160;do. It applies to&#160;you!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I will crush you, child!&#34;&#160;Kronos bellowed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You won't,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;You&#160;promised.&#160;You're holding&#160;Kronos back even now.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;LIES!&#34; Kronos pushed again, and this time&#160;Annabeth lost her balance. With his free hand, Kronos&#160;<br/>
struck her face, and she slid backward.&#160;<br/>
I summoned all&#160;my&#160;will. I&#160;managed to rise, but&#160;it was like holding the weight of the sky again.&#160;<br/>
Kronos loomed over Annabeth, his sword raised.&#160;<br/>
Blood trickled&#160;from&#160;the corner of her mouth. She croaked, &#34;Family, Luke. You&#160;promised.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I took a painful step forward. Grover was back on his feet, over by&#160;the throne&#160;of Hera, but he seemed&#160;<br/>
to be struggling to move as well. Before either of&#160;us could get&#160;anywhere close to Annabeth, Kronos&#160;<br/>staggered.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=176></a>He stared at the knife in Annabeth's&#160;hand, the blood&#160;on her face.&#160;<i>&#34;Promise.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
Then he gasped like he couldn't get air. &#34;Annabeth .&#160;. .&#34; But it wasn't the Titan's voice. It was Luke's.&#160;<br/>
He stumbled&#160;forward like he couldn't control his own&#160;body. &#34;You're bleeding. . .&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;My knife.&#34;&#160;Annabeth tried to&#160;raise her dagger, but it&#160;clattered out&#160;of her hand.&#160;Her arm&#160;was&#160;bent at a&#160;<br/>
funny&#160;angle.&#160;She looked at&#160;me, imploring, &#34;Percy, please . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I could move again.&#160;<br/>
I surged forward and scooped up&#160;her knife. I knocked Backbiter out of&#160;Luke's&#160;hand,&#160;and it&#160;spun into&#160;<br/>
the hearth. Luke hardly&#160;paid&#160;me&#160;any&#160;attention. He&#160;stepped toward Annabeth, but I put myself between&#160;<br/>him&#160;and her.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't touch&#160;her,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Anger rippled across his face. Kronos's&#160;voice growled:&#160;&#34;Jackson . . .&#34; Was it&#160;my&#160;imagination, or was&#160;<br/>
his whole body&#160;glowing, turning&#160;gold?&#160;<br/>
He gasped again. Luke's voice:<i>&#160;</i>&#34;He's changing. Help. He's&#160;. . . he's&#160;almost ready.&#160;He won't need&#160;my&#160;<br/>
body anymore. Please—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;NO!&#34; Kronos bellowed. He looked&#160;around for&#160;his sword,&#160;but&#160;it was in the&#160;hearth, glowing&#160;among the&#160;<br/>
coals.&#160;<br/>
He stumbled toward it. I tried to stop&#160;him,&#160;but he pushed me&#160;out of&#160;the way with&#160;such force&#160;I landed&#160;<br/>
next to Annabeth and cracked my&#160;head on the base of Athena's throne.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The knife, Percy,&#34; Annabeth muttered. Her breath&#160;was shallow. &#34;Hero . . . cursed blade . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
When my&#160;vision came back into&#160;focus,&#160;I saw Kronos&#160;grasping&#160;his sword. Then&#160;he bellowed&#160;in pain&#160;<br/>
and dropped&#160;it. His hands&#160;were&#160;smoking and seared.&#160;The hearth fire had grown red-hot, like the scythe&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;compatible with it. I saw an image of&#160;Hestia flickering in the ashes, frowning at Kronos with&#160;<br/>disapproval.&#160;<br/>
Luke turned and collapsed,&#160;clutching his&#160;ruined hands. &#34;Please, Percy . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
I struggled to&#160;my&#160;feet. I&#160;moved toward him&#160;with&#160;the knife. I should&#160;kill him.&#160;That was the plan.&#160;<br/>
Luke seemed&#160;to know what I was thinking. He moistened his lips.&#160;&#34;You can't&#160;. . . can't&#160;do it&#160;yourself.&#160;<br/>
He'll break&#160;my&#160;control. He'll defend himself.&#160;Only&#160;my&#160;hand. I know where. I can . . .&#160;can keep him&#160;<br/>controlled.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He was definitely&#160;glowing&#160;now, his skin&#160;starting to smoke.&#160;<br/>
I raised the knife to strike. Then I&#160;looked at Annabeth, at Grover&#160;cradling her in&#160;his arms, trying&#160;to&#160;<br/>
shield her. And I finally understood&#160;what she'd been trying to&#160;tell&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
<i>You are not&#160;the hero,&#160;</i>Rachel had said.&#160;<i>It will affect what you&#160;do.</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Please,&#34; Luke groaned. &#34;No time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=177></a>If Kronos evolved into&#160;his true form, there would be&#160;no stopping&#160;him.&#160;He would make Typhon look&#160;<br/>
like a playground&#160;bully.&#160;<br/>
The line from&#160;the great&#160;prophecy&#160;echoed in my&#160;head:&#160;<i>A hero's&#160;soul, cursed blade shall&#160;reap.&#160;</i>My&#160;<br/>
whole world tipped upside down, and I&#160;gave the knife to Luke.&#160;<br/>
Grover yelped. &#34;Percy? Are you . .&#160;. um&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Crazy. Insane. Off&#160;my&#160;rocker. Probably.&#160;<br/>
But I watched as Luke grasped the hilt.&#160;<br/>
I stood before&#160;him—defenseless.&#160;<br/>
He unlatched the side straps of his armor, exposing&#160;a small bit of&#160;his skin just&#160;under his left&#160;arm,&#160;a&#160;<br/>
place that would be very&#160;hard to hit.&#160;With difficulty,&#160;he&#160;stabbed himself.&#160;<br/>
It wasn't&#160;a deep cut, but Luke howled.&#160;His eyes glowed like lava. The throne&#160;room&#160;shook, throwing&#160;<br/>
me off&#160;my&#160;feet. An aura of energy&#160;surrounded Luke,&#160;growing brighter and brighter. I shut my&#160;eyes and&#160;<br/>felt a force like a nuclear explosion blister&#160;my&#160;skin and crack&#160;my&#160;lips.&#160;<br/>
It was silent for a long time.&#160;<br/>
When I opened&#160;my&#160;eyes, I saw Luke sprawled at the&#160;hearth. On the floor around him&#160;was a&#160;blackened&#160;<br/>
circle of ash. Kronos's&#160;scythe had liquefied into&#160;molten metal and was trickling into the coals of the&#160;<br/>hearth, which now glowed&#160;like a blacksmith's furnace.&#160;<br/>
Luke's&#160;left&#160;side was bloody. His eyes were open—blue&#160;eyes, the&#160;way&#160;they&#160;used&#160;to be. His breath was&#160;<br/>
a deep rattle.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good . .&#160;. blade,&#34; he croaked.&#160;<br/>
I knelt next to&#160;him.&#160;Annabeth limped over with Grover's&#160;support. They&#160;both&#160;had tears in their eyes.&#160;<br/>
Luke gazed at Annabeth. &#34;You knew. I&#160;almost killed you,&#160;but&#160;you&#160;knew . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Shhh.&#34; Her voice trembled. &#34;You were a hero at the end, Luke. You'll go to Elysium.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He shook his&#160;head weakly.&#160;&#34;Think&#160;. . . rebirth. Try for&#160;three times. Isles of the Blest.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth sniffled. &#34;You always&#160;pushed&#160;yourself too&#160;hard.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He held up his charred hand. Annabeth touched his fingertips.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Did&#160;you&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;Luke coughed and his lips&#160;glistened red. &#34;Did&#160;you love&#160;me?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth wiped her tears away. &#34;There was a time I&#160;thought .&#160;. .&#160;well, I thought . .&#160;.&#34; She looked at&#160;<br/>
me, like she&#160;was drinking in the fact that I was still&#160;here. And I realized I&#160;was doing the same thing. The&#160;<br/>world was collapsing, and&#160;the only&#160;thing&#160;that really&#160;mattered to&#160;me&#160;was that she&#160;was alive.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You were like a brother to&#160;me, Luke,&#34; she said softly. &#34;But I&#160;didn't&#160;love you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He nodded, as&#160;if he'd&#160;expected it. He winced in pain.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We can get ambrosia,&#34; Grover said. &#34;We can—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=178></a>&#34;Grover,&#34; Luke gulped. &#34;You're the bravest satyr I&#160;ever knew.&#160;But no. There's no healing. . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
Another cough.&#160;<br/>
He gripped my sleeve, and I could feel the heat of&#160;his&#160;skin like a fire. &#34;Ethan. Me. All the unclaimed.&#160;<br/>
Don't let it . . . Don't let it happen again.&#34;&#160;<br/>
His eyes were angry, but&#160;pleading too.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I won't,&#34; I said. &#34;I promise.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Luke nodded,&#160;and his hand&#160;went slack.&#160;<br/>
The gods arrived a few&#160;minutes later in&#160;their full war regalia, thundering into&#160;the throne room and&#160;<br/>
expecting a battle.&#160;<br/>
What they found were Annabeth, Grover, and me standing over the body of a&#160;broken half-blood, in&#160;<br/>
the dim&#160;warm light&#160;of the hearth.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; my&#160;father called, awe in his voice.<i>&#160;</i>&#34;What . . .&#160;what is this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I turned and faced the Olympians.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We need a shroud,&#34; I announced, my&#160;voice cracking. &#34;A shroud for the son of&#160;Hermes.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
TWENTY&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
WE &#160;WIN &#160;FABULOUS&#160;<br/>
PRIZES&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The Three Fates themselves took Luke's&#160;body.&#160;<br/>
I hadn't seen the old ladies in&#160;years, since I'd witnessed&#160;them&#160;snip a life thread at&#160;a roadside fruit stand&#160;<br/>
when I was twelve. They'd scared&#160;me then, and they&#160;scared&#160;me now—three ghoulish grandmothers&#160;with&#160;<br/>bags of knitting needles and&#160;yarn.&#160;<br/>
One of them&#160;looked at me, and even though she didn't&#160;say&#160;anything, my&#160;life literally&#160;flashed before&#160;<br/>
my&#160;eyes. Suddenly&#160;I was twenty. Then&#160;I was a&#160;middle-aged&#160;man. Then I turned old and withered. All the&#160;<br/>strength left&#160;my&#160;body, and I saw&#160;my&#160;own tombstone and an open grave, a coffin being&#160;lowered into the&#160;<br/>ground. All this happened&#160;in less than a second.&#160;<br/>
<i>It is done,&#160;</i>she&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
The Fate held&#160;up the snippet of blue&#160;yarn—and I&#160;knew it was the same one I'd seen four&#160;years ago,&#160;<br/>
the lifeline I'd watched them&#160;snip. I had thought it&#160;was&#160;my&#160;life.&#160;Now I realized&#160;it was Luke's. They'd been&#160;<br/>showing me&#160;the life that would&#160;have to&#160;be sacrificed to set things right.&#160;<br/>
They gathered up&#160;Luke's&#160;body,&#160;now wrapped in&#160;a&#160;white-and-green shroud, and&#160;began carrying it&#160;out&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=179></a>of the throne room.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Wait,&#34; Hermes said.&#160;<br/>
The messenger god was dressed in his classic outfit of&#160;white Greek robes, sandals, and helmet. The&#160;<br/>
wings of&#160;his&#160;helm&#160;fluttered as he walked. The snakes George and Martha curled around&#160;his caduceus,&#160;<br/>murmuring,&#160;<i>Luke, poor Luke.</i>&#160;<br/>
I thought about May&#160;Castellan, alone in&#160;her kitchen, baking cookies and making sandwiches for a son&#160;<br/>
who would&#160;never come&#160;home.&#160;<br/>
Hermes unwrapped Luke's face&#160;and kissed his forehead. He&#160;murmured some words in Ancient&#160;<br/>
Greek—a&#160;final blessing.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Farewell,&#34; he whispered. Then he nodded and&#160;allowed the Fates to carry&#160;away&#160;his son's body.&#160;<br/>
As they&#160;left, I thought about the Great&#160;Prophecy. The lines now&#160;made&#160;sense to me.&#160;<i>The hero's&#160;soul,&#160;</i><br/>
<i>cursed blade shall reap.&#160;</i>The hero was&#160;Luke. The cursed blade was the knife he'd&#160;given Annabeth long&#160;<br/>ago—cursed&#160;because&#160;Luke had broken his promise&#160;and betrayed his friends.&#160;<i>A&#160;single choice shall end his&#160;</i><br/>
<i>days.&#160;&#160;</i>My&#160;choice, to give&#160;him&#160;the knife, and to believe,&#160;as Annabeth had, that he was still capable of&#160;<br/>setting things right.&#160;<i>Olympus to preserve or raze.&#160;</i>By sacrificing himself, he had saved Olympus. Rachel&#160;<br/>was right. In the end, I wasn't really&#160;the&#160;hero. Luke was.&#160;<br/>
And I understood something else: When&#160;Luke had descended into the River Styx, he would've had to&#160;<br/>
focus on something important that would hold&#160;him&#160;to his mortal life. Otherwise he would've dissolved. I&#160;<br/>had seen Annabeth, and I had a feeling he had too.&#160;He had pictured that scene Hestia showed me—of&#160;<br/>himself in the good&#160;old&#160;days&#160;with Thalia and Annabeth, when&#160;he&#160;promised they would&#160;be&#160;a family.&#160;<br/>Hurting Annabeth in battle had shocked him&#160;into remembering that promise.&#160;It had allowed his mortal&#160;<br/>conscience to&#160;take over again, and&#160;defeat Kronos. His weak spot—his Achilles heel—had saved us all.&#160;<br/>
Next to me, Annabeth's&#160;knees buckled. I caught her,&#160;but she cried out in&#160;pain, and I realized I'd&#160;<br/>
grabbed her broken arm.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh gods,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Annabeth, I'm&#160;sorry.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's all right,&#34; she said as she passed out in my&#160;arms.&#160;<br/>
&#34;She needs help!&#34; I&#160;yelled.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I've got this.&#34; Apollo stepped forward.&#160;His fiery&#160;armor was so bright it was hard to look at,&#160;and his&#160;<br/>
matching Ray-Bans and perfect smile&#160;made him&#160;look like a male&#160;model for battle gear. &#34;God of medicine,&#160;<br/>at your service.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He passed his hand over&#160;Annabeth's&#160;face and spoke an incantation. Immediately&#160;the bruises faded.&#160;<br/>
Her cuts and scars disappeared. Her arm straightened, and she sighed in her sleep.&#160;<br/>
Apollo grinned. &#34;She'll be fine in a few&#160;minutes.&#160;Just enough time for me&#160;to compose a poem&#160;about&#160;<br/>
our victory: 'Apollo and&#160;his friends save Olympus.'&#160;Good, eh?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks, Apollo,&#34; I said. &#34;I'll, um, let you handle the&#160;poetry.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The next few hours were a blur. I remembered&#160;my&#160;promise to&#160;my&#160;mother. Zeus&#160;didn't even&#160;blink an&#160;<br/>
eye when I told him&#160;my&#160;strange request. He snapped&#160;his fingers&#160;and informed&#160;me&#160;that the top of the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=180></a>Empire State Building was now lit up&#160;blue. Most mortals would&#160;just have to&#160;wonder what it meant, but&#160;<br/>my&#160;mom&#160;would know: I had survived, Olympus was saved.&#160;<br/>
The gods set&#160;about repairing the&#160;throne&#160;room, which&#160;went surprisingly&#160;fast with&#160;twelve superpowerful&#160;<br/>
beings at work. Grover and I cared for&#160;the wounded,&#160;and once the sky&#160;bridge re-formed, we greeted our&#160;<br/>friends who had survived. The Cyclopes had saved Thalia from&#160;the fallen&#160;statue. She was on&#160;crutches, but&#160;<br/>otherwise she was okay.&#160;Connor and&#160;Travis Stoll had&#160;made it&#160;through with only&#160;minor&#160;injuries. They&#160;<br/>promised me&#160;they&#160;hadn't&#160;even looted the city&#160;much.&#160;They&#160;told&#160;me&#160;my&#160;parents were fine, though they&#160;<br/>weren't allowed into&#160;Mount&#160;Olympus. Mrs. O'Leary&#160;had&#160;dug&#160;Chiron out&#160;of the&#160;rubble and&#160;rushed him&#160;off&#160;<br/>to camp. The Stolls looked&#160;kind of&#160;worried about the&#160;old centaur, but at least he&#160;was alive. Katie Gardner&#160;<br/>reported that she'd seen Rachel Elizabeth Dare run&#160;out&#160;of the&#160;Empire State Building&#160;at&#160;the end of the&#160;<br/>battle. Rachel had looked unharmed, but&#160;nobody&#160;knew where she'd gone, which also troubled&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
Nico di Angelo came&#160;into Olympus to a hero's&#160;welcome, his father right behind&#160;him,&#160;despite the fact&#160;<br/>
that Hades&#160;was only&#160;supposed to visit Olympus on winter solstice. The god of&#160;the dead looked stunned&#160;<br/>when his relatives clapped him&#160;on the back. I doubt he'd&#160;ever gotten such an enthusiastic welcome before.&#160;<br/>
Clarisse&#160;marched in, still shivering from her time in&#160;the ice block, and Ares&#160;bellowed, &#34;There's&#160;my&#160;<br/>
girl!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The god of&#160;war ruffled her hair and pounded&#160;her on the back, calling her the best warrior&#160;he'd&#160;ever&#160;<br/>
seen. &#34;That drakon-slaying? THAT'S&#160;what I'm talking about!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She looked pretty&#160;overwhelmed. All she could do was nod and blink, like she was afraid he'd&#160;start&#160;<br/>
hitting&#160;her, but eventually&#160;she began to&#160;smile.&#160;<br/>
Hera&#160;and Hephaestus passed&#160;me,&#160;and while Hephaestus was a little grumpy&#160;about my&#160;jumping on his&#160;<br/>
throne, he thought I'd done &#34;a&#160;pretty bang-up job, mostly.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hera sniffed in disdain. &#34;I&#160;suppose I won't destroy&#160;you&#160;and that little&#160;girl now.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth saved Olympus,&#34; I told&#160;her.&#160;&#34;She convinced Luke to&#160;stop&#160;Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hmm,&#34; Hera whirled away in a huff, but I figured&#160;our lives would be safe, at least for a little while.&#160;<br/>
Dionysus's&#160;head was&#160;still&#160;wrapped in a bandage. He&#160;looked me up&#160;and down and said, &#34;Well, Percy&#160;<br/>
Jackson. I see Pollux made it through,&#160;so I suppose&#160;you aren't&#160;completely&#160;inept. It's&#160;all thanks to my&#160;<br/>training, I suppose.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Urn,&#160;yes, sir,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
Mr. D nodded. &#34;As thanks&#160;for my&#160;bravery,&#160;Zeus has cut my&#160;probation at that miserable camp&#160;in&#160;half. I&#160;<br/>
now have only fifty&#160;years left instead of one hundred.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Fifty&#160;years, huh?&#34; I tried&#160;to imagine putting&#160;up with&#160;Dionysus until I was an old man, assuming I&#160;<br/>
lived that long.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Don't get so excited, Jackson,&#34; he said, and I realized he was saying my&#160;name&#160;correctly. &#34;I still plan&#160;<br/>
on making your life miserable.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I couldn't help smiling. &#34;Naturally.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Just so we understand each other.&#34; He turned and began repairing his grapevine throne, which had&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=181></a>been singed by&#160;fire.&#160;<br/>
Grover stayed at&#160;my&#160;side. From&#160;time to&#160;time he&#160;would break down in tears.&#160;&#34;So&#160;many&#160;nature spirits&#160;<br/>
dead, Percy.&#160;So&#160;<i>many.</i>&#34;&#160;<br/>
I put&#160;my&#160;arm&#160;around his shoulders and gave him&#160;a rag&#160;to blow his nose. &#34;You did a great job, G-man.&#160;<br/>
We&#160;&#160;<i>will&#160;&#160;</i>come back from&#160;this. We'll plant new trees. We'll clean up the&#160;parks. Your friends will be&#160;<br/>reincarnated into a better world.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He sniffled dejectedly. &#34;I&#160;. . . I&#160;suppose. But it&#160;was hard enough to rally&#160;them&#160;before. I'm&#160;still an&#160;<br/>
outcast. I could barely&#160;get&#160;anyone to listen to&#160;me&#160;about&#160;Pan. Now will they&#160;ever listen to&#160;me&#160;again? I led&#160;<br/>them&#160;into a slaughter.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;They&#160;will listen,&#34; I promised. &#34;Because you care&#160;about them. You care about the Wild&#160;more than&#160;<br/>
anyone.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He tried for a smile. &#34;Thanks, Percy.&#160;I&#160;hope . . . I&#160;hope&#160;you know I'm&#160;really&#160;proud to be&#160;your friend.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I patted his arm.&#160;&#34;Luke was right about one thing,&#160;G-man. You're the bravest satyr&#160;I ever&#160;met.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He blushed, but before he could say&#160;anything, conch horns blew. The army&#160;of Poseidon&#160;marched into&#160;<br/>
the throne room.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy!&#34; Tyson&#160;yelled. He charged toward&#160;me&#160;with&#160;his arms open. Fortunately&#160;he'd&#160;shrunk&#160;back to&#160;<br/>
normal size, so&#160;his hug was like getting&#160;hit by&#160;a tractor, not the entire farm.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You are not&#160;dead!&#34; he said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah!&#34; I agreed. &#34;Amazing, huh?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He clapped his hands and&#160;laughed happily. &#34;I am&#160;not dead either.&#160;Yay!&#160;We chained Typhon.&#160;It was&#160;<br/>
fun!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Behind him,&#160;fifty other armored Cyclopes laughed and nodded and&#160;gave each other high fives.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tyson led&#160;us,&#34; one rumbled. &#34;He is brave!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Bravest of the Cyclopes!&#34;&#160;another bellowed.&#160;<br/>
Tyson blushed. &#34;Was nothing.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I saw you!&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;You&#160;were incredible!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought poor Grover would pass out.&#160;He's&#160;deathly&#160;afraid of Cyclopes. But he&#160;steeled his nerves and&#160;<br/>
said, &#34;Yes. Um&#160;. . . three cheers for Tyson!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;YAAARRRRR!&#34; the Cyclopes roared.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Please don't&#160;eat&#160;me,&#34; Grover&#160;muttered, but I don't think anyone heard him.&#160;<br/>
The conch horns blasted&#160;again. The Cyclopes parted, and my&#160;father&#160;strode into the throne room in his&#160;<br/>
battle armor, his trident glowing in his&#160;hands.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tyson!&#34; he roared. &#34;Well&#160;done, my&#160;son. And Percy—&#34;&#160;His face turned stern. He wagged his finger at&#160;<br/>
me, and for a second I was afraid he was going to zap&#160;me. &#34;I even forgive&#160;you for sitting&#160;on my&#160;throne.&#160;<br/>You have saved Olympus!&#34;&#160;<br/>
He held out his arms and gave&#160;me&#160;a hug. I realized,<i>&#160;</i>a little embarrassed, that I'd never actually&#160;hugged&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=182></a>my&#160;dad before. He was warm—like a regular human—and he smelled of a salty beach and fresh sea air.&#160;<br/>
When he pulled away, he smiled kindly&#160;at&#160;me. I felt&#160;so good, I'll admit I teared up a little. I guess until&#160;<br/>
that moment I hadn't allowed myself to realize just how terrified I had been the last few days.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Dad—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Shhh,&#34; he said. &#34;No hero is&#160;above fear, Percy.&#160;And&#160;<i>you&#160;&#160;</i>have risen above every&#160;hero. Not even&#160;<br/>
Hercules—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;POSEIDON!&#34; a voice roared.&#160;<br/>
Zeus had taken his throne.&#160;He glared across the room&#160;at&#160;my&#160;dad while all the other gods filed in and&#160;<br/>
took&#160;their seats. Even Hades was present, sitting on&#160;a simple stone guest chair at the foot&#160;of&#160;the hearth.&#160;<br/>Nico sat cross-legged on the ground at&#160;his dad's feet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, Poseidon?&#34;&#160;Zeus grumped. &#34;Are&#160;you too proud to join us in&#160;council, my&#160;brother?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought Poseidon was going to&#160;get mad, but&#160;he just&#160;looked at me&#160;and winked.&#160;&#34;I would&#160;be honored,&#160;<br/>
Lord Zeus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I guess&#160;miracles do happen. Poseidon strode over&#160;to his fishing seat,&#160;and the Olympian&#160;Council&#160;<br/>
convened.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
While Zeus was talking—some&#160;long speech about the&#160;bravery&#160;of the gods, etc.—Annabeth walked in and&#160;<br/>stood next&#160;to&#160;me. She looked good for someone who'd recently&#160;passed out.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Miss&#160;much?&#34;&#160;she whispered.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Nobody's planning to&#160;kill&#160;us, so far,&#34; I&#160;whispered back.&#160;<br/>
&#34;First time today.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I cracked up, but Grover nudged me&#160;because Hera was giving&#160;us a dirty&#160;look.&#160;<br/>
&#34;As for&#160;my&#160;brothers,&#34; Zeus said, &#34;we&#160;are thankful&#34;—he cleared his&#160;throat like the words&#160;were&#160;hard to&#160;<br/>
get out—&#34;erm,&#160;thankful for the aid of&#160;Hades.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The lord&#160;of the dead nodded. He had a&#160;smug look&#160;on his face, but I figure&#160;he'd earned the right. He&#160;<br/>
patted his son&#160;Nico on the shoulders, and&#160;Nico&#160;looked&#160;happier than I'd ever seen him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;And, of course,&#34; Zeus&#160;continued,&#160;though&#160;he looked like his pants&#160;were&#160;smoldering, &#34;we&#160;must . . . um&#160;<br/>
. . . thank Poseidon.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;sorry,&#160;brother,&#34; Poseidon said. &#34;What was that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;We&#160;must thank Poseidon,&#34;&#160;Zeus growled. &#34;Without&#160;whom&#160;. . . it would've been difficult—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Difficult?&#34; Poseidon asked innocently.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Impossible,&#34; Zeus said. &#34;Impossible to defeat Typhon.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The gods murmured agreement and pounded their weapons in approval.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Which leaves us,&#34; Zeus said, &#34;only&#160;the matter&#160;of thanking our&#160;young demigod heroes, who defended&#160;<br/>
Olympus so well—even if&#160;there are a few dents in my throne.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He called Thalia forward first, since she was his&#160;daughter, and promised her help in filling the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=183></a>Hunters'&#160;ranks.&#160;<br/>
Artemis smiled. &#34;You&#160;have&#160;done well,&#160;my&#160;lieutenant.&#160;You&#160;have made&#160;me&#160;proud, and all&#160;those Hunters&#160;<br/>
who perished in my&#160;service will never be forgotten. They&#160;will<i>&#160;</i>achieve Elysium,&#160;I am&#160;sure.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She glared pointedly&#160;at Hades.&#160;<br/>
He shrugged.&#160;&#34;Probably.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Artemis glared&#160;at him&#160;some&#160;more.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Okay,&#34; Hades grumbled. &#34;I'll streamline their application process.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Thalia beamed with&#160;pride.&#160;&#34;Thank&#160;you,&#160;my&#160;lady.&#34; She bowed to the gods, even Hades, and then&#160;<br/>
limped over to stand by&#160;Artemis's side.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tyson, son of Poseidon!&#34;&#160;Zeus&#160;called.&#160;Tyson looked&#160;nervous, but&#160;he went to stand in the&#160;middle of&#160;<br/>
the Council, and Zeus grunted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Doesn't&#160;miss&#160;many&#160;meals, does he?&#34;&#160;Zeus&#160;muttered. &#34;Tyson, for&#160;your&#160;bravery in&#160;the war, and for&#160;<br/>
leading the Cyclopes,&#160;you&#160;are appointed&#160;a general in&#160;the armies of Olympus. You shall&#160;henceforth lead&#160;<br/>your brethren&#160;into war whenever required by&#160;the gods.&#160;And&#160;you shall have a new . . . um&#160;. . . what kind of&#160;<br/>weapon would&#160;you like? A sword? An axe?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Stick!&#34; Tyson said, showing his broken&#160;club.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Very&#160;well,&#34;&#160;Zeus said. &#34;We will grant&#160;you a new,&#160;er, stick. The best stick that may&#160;be found.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hooray!&#34; Tyson cried, and all the Cyclopes cheered and&#160;pounded him&#160;on the back as he rejoined&#160;<br/>
them.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Grover Underwood of the&#160;satyrs!&#34; Dionysus called.&#160;<br/>
Grover came&#160;forward nervously.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, stop chewing your shirt,&#34; Dionysus chided. &#34;Honestly, I'm not going to&#160;blast you.&#160;For your&#160;<br/>
bravery&#160;and sacrifice, blah,&#160;blah, blah, and since we&#160;have an unfortunate vacancy, the gods&#160;have seen fit&#160;<br/>to name&#160;you&#160;a&#160;member of the Council of&#160;Cloven Elders.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover collapsed on the spot.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, wonderful,&#34; Dionysus&#160;sighed,&#160;as several naiads&#160;came forward to&#160;help Grover. &#34;Well, when he&#160;<br/>
wakes up, someone tell him&#160;that he&#160;will no longer&#160;be&#160;an outcast, and that all satyrs, naiads, and other&#160;<br/>spirits of nature will henceforth treat him&#160;as&#160;a lord&#160;of the Wild,&#160;with all rights, privileges,&#160;and honors,&#160;<br/>blah, blah,&#160;blah. Now please, drag him&#160;off before he&#160;wakes up and starts groveling.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;FOOOOOD,&#34; Grover moaned, as the nature spirits carried him&#160;away.&#160;<br/>
I figured&#160;he'd be okay. He&#160;would wake&#160;up as a lord&#160;of the Wild&#160;with a bunch of beautiful naiads&#160;<br/>
taking care of him.&#160;Life could be worse.&#160;<br/>
Athena called,&#160;&#34;Annabeth&#160;Chase,&#160;my&#160;own daughter.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth squeezed&#160;my&#160;arm,&#160;then walked forward and knelt at her&#160;mother's feet.&#160;<br/>
Athena smiled. &#34;You, my&#160;daughter, have&#160;exceeded&#160;all expectations. You have used your wits, your&#160;<br/>
strength, and your courage to defend&#160;this city, and our seat of power. It has&#160;come&#160;to&#160;our attention that&#160;<br/>Olympus is . . . well, trashed. The Titan lord did much&#160;damage that will have to&#160;be repaired. We could&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=184></a>rebuild it by&#160;magic, of course, and make it just as&#160;it was. But the gods feel that the city&#160;could&#160;be&#160;<br/>improved. We will take this as an opportunity. And&#160;you, my&#160;daughter, will design these improvements.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth looked up, stunned. &#34;My&#160;. .&#160;.&#160;my&#160;lady?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Athena smiled wryly.&#160;&#34;You&#160;<i>are&#160;&#160;</i>an architect, are&#160;you not? You have studied the techniques of&#160;<br/>
Daedalus himself. Who better to redesign Olympus&#160;and make it a&#160;monument that will last for another&#160;<br/>eon?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You mean . . . I can design whatever I want?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;As your heart desires,&#34; the goddess said.&#160;&#34;Make us a city&#160;for the ages.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;As long as&#160;you have plenty&#160;of statues of&#160;me,&#34; Apollo added.&#160;<br/>
&#34;And me,&#34; Aphrodite agreed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, and&#160;me!&#34; Ares said.&#160;&#34;Big statues with huge wicked swords and—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;All right!&#34;&#160;Athena interrupted. &#34;She&#160;gets the point. Rise, my&#160;daughter, official architect of&#160;<br/>
Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth rose in a trance and walked back toward me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Way&#160;to&#160;go,&#34;&#160;I told her,&#160;grinning.&#160;<br/>
For once she&#160;was at a loss&#160;for words.&#160;&#34;I'll . .&#160;. I'll have&#160;to start planning&#160;. .&#160;. Drafting&#160;paper, and, um,&#160;<br/>
pencils—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;PERCY JACKSON!&#34; Poseidon announced. My&#160;name echoed around&#160;the chamber.&#160;<br/>
All talking died down. The room&#160;was silent except for the crackle&#160;of the hearth fire. Everyone's eyes&#160;<br/>
were on&#160;me—all the gods, the demigods, the Cyclopes, the&#160;spirits. I walked into&#160;the&#160;middle of the throne&#160;<br/>room. Hestia&#160;smiled&#160;at&#160;me reassuringly. She was in&#160;the form&#160;of a girl now,&#160;and she seemed happy&#160;and&#160;<br/>content to be&#160;sitting<i>&#160;</i>by&#160;her&#160;fire again. Her smile gave&#160;me courage to keep walking.&#160;<br/>
First I bowed to Zeus. Then&#160;I knelt at my father's&#160;feet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rise,&#160;my&#160;son,&#34; Poseidon&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
I stood uneasily.&#160;<br/>
&#34;A great hero&#160;must be rewarded,&#34; Poseidon said. &#34;Is&#160;there anyone here who would deny&#160;that&#160;my&#160;son&#160;<br/>
is deserving?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I waited&#160;for someone to pipe up. The gods never agreed on anything, and many&#160;of them&#160;still didn't&#160;<br/>
like me, but not a single one protested.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The Council&#160;agrees,&#34; Zeus&#160;said. &#34;Percy Jackson, you will have one gift from&#160;the gods.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I hesitated. &#34;Any&#160;gift?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Zeus nodded&#160;grimly. &#34;I know what you&#160;will ask. The greatest gift of all. Yes, if&#160;you want it, it&#160;shall be&#160;<br/>
yours. The gods have not&#160;bestowed this gift&#160;on a mortal hero in many centuries, but, Perseus Jackson—if&#160;<br/>you wish it—you shall be&#160;made&#160;a god. Immortal.&#160;Undying.&#160;You shall serve as&#160;your father's&#160;lieutenant for&#160;<br/>all time.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at him,&#160;stunned. &#34;Um&#160;. . . a god?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=185></a>Zeus rolled&#160;his eyes. &#34;A dimwitted god, apparently. But yes. With the consensus of the entire&#160;<br/>
Council, I can make you immortal. Then&#160;I will have to&#160;put&#160;up with&#160;you forever.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hmm,&#34; Ares&#160;mused. &#34;That means I&#160;can&#160;smash him&#160;to&#160;a pulp as often as I want, and he'll just keep&#160;<br/>
coming back for more. I like this idea.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I approve as well,&#34; Athena said, though&#160;she was looking at Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
I glanced back. Annabeth&#160;was trying not to meet&#160;my eyes. Her face was pale.&#160;I flashed back to two&#160;<br/>
years ago, when I'd thought&#160;she&#160;was going to take the&#160;pledge to Artemis and become a Hunter. I'd been on&#160;<br/>the edge of a&#160;panic attack, thinking&#160;that I'd lose&#160;her. Now, she looked pretty&#160;much the same&#160;way.&#160;<br/>
I thought about the Three Fates, and the way&#160;I'd&#160;seen&#160;my&#160;life flash by. I could avoid all that. No&#160;<br/>
aging, no death, no body in the grave. I could be&#160;a&#160;teenager forever, in top&#160;condition, powerful, and&#160;<br/>immortal, serving my&#160;father. I could&#160;have&#160;power and eternal life.&#160;<br/>
Who could refuse that?&#160;<br/>
Then I looked at Annabeth again. I thought about my&#160;friends from camp:&#160;Charles&#160;Beckendorf,&#160;<br/>
Michael Yew, Silena Beauregard, so many&#160;others&#160;who were now dead. I thought about Ethan&#160;Nakamura&#160;<br/>and Luke.&#160;<br/>
And I knew&#160;what to do.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
The Council&#160;was silent. The gods frowned at&#160;each other like they must have misheard.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No?&#34; Zeus said. &#34;You are . . . turning&#160;<i>down&#160;</i>our generous&#160;gift?&#34;&#160;<br/>
There was&#160;a dangerous edge&#160;to his voice,&#160;like a thunderstorm&#160;about to erupt.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;honored and everything,&#34; I said. &#34;Don't get&#160;me&#160;wrong.&#160;It's&#160;just . . . I've got a lot of life left to live.&#160;<br/>
I'd hate to peak in my&#160;sophomore year.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The gods were glaring at&#160;me, but Annabeth had her hands over&#160;her mouth. Her eyes were&#160;shining.&#160;<br/>
And that kind&#160;of made up for it.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I do want a&#160;gift, though,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;Do&#160;you promise to grant my&#160;wish?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Zeus thought&#160;about this.&#160;&#34;If it is within our power.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It is,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;And it's not even difficult. But I need&#160;your promise on the River Styx.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; Dionysus cried. &#34;You don't trust us?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Someone once told me,&#34; I said, looking&#160;at Hades, &#34;you should always&#160;get a solemn&#160;oath.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hades shrugged. &#34;Guilty.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Very&#160;well!&#34;&#160;Zeus growled. &#34;In the name of the Council, we&#160;swear by&#160;the River Styx&#160;to grant your&#160;<br/>
<i>reasonable&#160;</i>request as long&#160;as it is within our power.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The other gods muttered assent. Thunder boomed, shaking the throne room. The deal was&#160;made.&#160;<br/>
&#34;From&#160;now on, I want to you properly&#160;recognize the&#160;children of the gods,&#34; I said. &#34;All the children . . .&#160;<br/>
of&#160;<i>all&#160;</i>the gods.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Olympians shifted uncomfortably.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=186></a>&#34;Percy,&#34; my&#160;father said, &#34;what exactly&#160;do&#160;you mean?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Kronos couldn't have risen if it hadn't&#160;been for a&#160;lot of&#160;demigods who felt&#160;abandoned&#160;by&#160;their&#160;<br/>
parents,&#34; I said. &#34;They&#160;felt&#160;angry,&#160;resentful, and&#160;unloved, and they&#160;had a good reason.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Zeus's royal nostrils flared. &#34;You dare accuse—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No more undetermined children,&#34; I said. &#34;I want&#160;you to&#160;promise to claim&#160;your children—all your&#160;<br/>
demigod children—by&#160;the&#160;time they&#160;turn&#160;thirteen. They&#160;won't be left out in the&#160;world on their own at the&#160;<br/>mercy&#160;of monsters. I want them&#160;claimed and brought&#160;to&#160;camp&#160;so they&#160;can&#160;be trained right, and survive.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Now, wait just a&#160;moment,&#34; Apollo said, but I was on a roll.&#160;<br/>
&#34;And the&#160;minor gods,&#34; I said. &#34;Nemesis, Hecate, Morpheus, Janus, Hebe-—they&#160;all deserve a general&#160;<br/>
amnesty&#160;and&#160;a place at Camp&#160;Half-Blood. Their children shouldn't&#160;be ignored. Calypso and the other&#160;<br/>peaceful Titan-kind should be pardoned&#160;too. And Hades—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you calling me&#160;a&#160;<i>minor god</i>?&#34;<i>&#160;</i>Hades bellowed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#160;my&#160;lord,&#34; I said quickly. &#34;But&#160;your&#160;children should not be left out. They&#160;should have a cabin&#160;at&#160;<br/>
camp. Nico has proven that. No unclaimed demigods&#160;will be&#160;crammed into the Hermes cabin anymore,&#160;<br/>wondering who their parents are. They'll have their&#160;own cabins, for all the gods. And no more pact of the&#160;<br/>Big Three. That didn't work anyway.&#160;You've got to&#160;stop trying&#160;to get rid&#160;of powerful demigods. We're&#160;<br/>going to&#160;train them&#160;and accept them&#160;instead. All children of the gods will be welcome and&#160;treated with&#160;<br/>respect.&#160;That is my&#160;wish.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Zeus snorted. &#34;Is that all?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Poseidon said, &#34;you&#160;ask much.&#160;You presume much.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I hold&#160;you to&#160;your&#160;oath,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;All of&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I got a lot of steely&#160;looks.&#160;Strangely, it was&#160;Athena&#160;who spoke up: &#34;The boy&#160;is&#160;correct. We have been&#160;<br/>
unwise to ignore our children. It proved a strategic weakness in this war and almost caused our&#160;<br/>destruction. Percy&#160;Jackson, I have had&#160;my&#160;doubts about&#160;you, but perhaps&#34;—she&#160;glanced at Annabeth, and&#160;<br/>then spoke as if the words had a sour taste—&#34;perhaps I was mistaken. I move that we accept the&#160;boy's&#160;<br/>plan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Humph,&#34; Zeus said. &#34;Being told what to&#160;do by&#160;a mere child. But I suppose . .&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;All in favor,&#34; Hermes said.&#160;<br/>
All the gods raised their hands.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;thanks,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
I turned, but&#160;before I could leave, Poseidon called, &#34;Honor guard!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Immediately&#160;the Cyclopes&#160;came forward and made two lines from the thrones to the door—an aisle&#160;<br/>
for me to walk through.&#160;They&#160;came to attention.&#160;<br/>
&#34;All hail, Perseus Jackson,&#34; Tyson said.&#160;&#34;Hero of Olympus . . . and my&#160;big brother!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=187></a>TWENTY-ONE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
BLACKJACK &#160;GETS&#160;<br/>
JACKED&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Annabeth and I were&#160;on&#160;our way&#160;out&#160;when I spotted Hermes&#160;in&#160;a side&#160;courtyard of the palace.&#160;He&#160;was&#160;<br/>staring at an Iris-message in&#160;the mist of a fountain.&#160;<br/>
I glanced at Annabeth. &#34;I'll meet you at the elevator.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You sure?&#34;&#160;Then she studied my&#160;face. &#34;Yeah, you're&#160;sure.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes didn't seem to notice&#160;me&#160;approach. The Iris-message images were going so fast&#160;I could hardly&#160;<br/>
understand them. Mortal newscasts from all over the country&#160;flashed by: scenes of Typhon's destruction,&#160;<br/>the wreckage our battle had left across&#160;Manhattan, the&#160;president doing a news conference, the&#160;mayor of&#160;<br/>New York, some army&#160;vehicles riding down the Avenue of the Americas.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Amazing,&#34; Hermes&#160;murmured. He turned toward&#160;me. &#34;Three thousand&#160;years, and I will never get&#160;<br/>
over the power of the Mist . . . and&#160;mortal ignorance.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thanks, I guess.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, not&#160;you.&#160;Although, I suppose I should wonder, turning&#160;down immortality.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It was the right choice.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes looked at&#160;me&#160;curiously, then&#160;returned his attention to&#160;the Iris-message. &#34;Look at them.&#160;<br/>
They've already&#160;decided&#160;Typhon was a&#160;freak series of&#160;storms. Don't I wish. They haven't figured out&#160;how&#160;<br/>all the statues in Lower&#160;Manhattan got&#160;removed from their pedestals&#160;and hacked to pieces. They&#160;keep&#160;<br/>showing a shot of Susan B. Anthony&#160;strangling Frederick Douglass.&#160;But I imagine they'll even come&#160;up&#160;<br/>with a logical explanation for that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;How bad is the city?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes shrugged. &#34;Surprisingly,&#160;not too bad. The&#160;mortals&#160;are shaken, of course. But this is New&#160;<br/>
York. I've never seen such a resilient&#160;bunch of humans. I imagine they'll be back to normal in a few&#160;<br/>weeks; and of course I'll be helping.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;the&#160;messenger of the&#160;gods. It's&#160;my&#160;job to&#160;monitor what the mortals are saying, and if&#160;necessary,&#160;<br/>
help them&#160;make sense of&#160;what's happened. I'll reassure them. Trust&#160;me, they'll put this down to a freak&#160;<br/>earthquake or a solar flare.&#160;Anything&#160;but&#160;the truth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He sounded&#160;bitter. George and Martha curled around his caduceus, but they&#160;were&#160;silent, which&#160;made&#160;<br/>
me think that&#160;Hermes was&#160;<i>really&#160;</i>really&#160;angry.&#160;I probably should've kept quiet,&#160;but I said, &#34;I&#160;owe<i>&#160;</i>you&#160;an&#160;<br/>apology.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes gave&#160;me a cautious&#160;look.&#160;&#34;And why&#160;is&#160;that?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I thought&#160;you were&#160;a bad&#160;father,&#34; I admitted.&#160;&#34;I thought&#160;you abandoned Luke because you&#160;knew his&#160;<br/>
future and didn't do anything to stop&#160;it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=188></a>&#34;I&#160;<i>did&#160;</i>know his future,&#34; Hermes&#160;said&#160;miserably.&#160;<br/>
&#34;But you knew&#160;more than&#160;just the bad stuff—that he'd turn evil. You understood&#160;what he&#160;would do in&#160;<br/>
the end. You&#160;knew he'd&#160;make the right choice. But&#160;you couldn't&#160;tell him,&#160;could&#160;you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes stared at the fountain. &#34;No one&#160;can tamper&#160;with fate, Percy, not even a god. If I had warned&#160;<br/>
him&#160;what&#160;was to come, or tried to influence his choices, I would've&#160;made things even worse. Staying&#160;<br/>silent, staying&#160;away&#160;from&#160;him&#160;. . . that was the hardest thing I've ever done.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You had to&#160;let him&#160;find his own path,&#34; I&#160;said, &#34;and play&#160;his part in&#160;saving Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes&#160;sighed. &#34;I should not have&#160;gotten&#160;mad at Annabeth. When Luke&#160;visited her in San Francisco&#160;.&#160;<br/>
. . well, I knew she would have a part to play&#160;in his&#160;fate. I foresaw that&#160;much. I thought perhaps she could&#160;<br/>do what I could not and save him.&#160;When she refused to&#160;go with him,&#160;I could barely&#160;contain&#160;my&#160;rage. I&#160;<br/>should&#160;have known better. I&#160;was really&#160;angry&#160;with myself.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Annabeth did save him,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Luke died a hero. He sacrificed himself to kill Kronos.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I appreciate&#160;your words,&#160;Percy.&#160;But Kronos isn't dead. You can't&#160;kill a Titan.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I don't know,&#34; Hermes grumbled. &#34;None of us do.&#160;Blown to dust. Scattered to the wind.&#160;With luck,&#160;<br/>
he's spread so thin that&#160;he'll never be able to form&#160;a consciousness&#160;again,&#160;much less a body. But don't&#160;<br/>mistake him&#160;for dead, Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My&#160;stomach did a queasy&#160;somersault. &#34;What about the other Titans?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;In hiding,&#34;&#160;Hermes&#160;said. &#34;Prometheus sent Zeus&#160;a&#160;message&#160;with a bunch of excuses for supporting&#160;<br/>
Kronos. 'I&#160;was just trying to&#160;minimize the damage,' blah, blah. He'll keep his head low for&#160;a few&#160;centuries&#160;<br/>if he's&#160;smart.&#160;Krios has fled, and Mount Othrys&#160;has&#160;crumbled into ruins. Oceanus slipped back into the&#160;<br/>deep ocean&#160;when it was&#160;clear&#160;Kronos had lost. Meanwhile,&#160;my&#160;son Luke is dead. He died believing I&#160;<br/>didn't care about him.&#160;I will never forgive&#160;myself.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes slashed his caduceus through the&#160;mist. The Iris-picture disappeared.&#160;<br/>
&#34;A long time ago,&#34; I said, &#34;you told me&#160;the hardest thing about being a god&#160;was not being&#160;able&#160;to help&#160;<br/>
your children.&#160;You also told&#160;me&#160;that you couldn't&#160;give up on&#160;your&#160;family, no matter how tempting they&#160;<br/>made it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And now&#160;you know I'm&#160;a hypocrite?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, you were right, Luke&#160;loved you.&#160;At the end, he&#160;realized his fate. I think he realized why&#160;you&#160;<br/>
couldn't help&#160;him.&#160;He remembered what&#160;was important.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Too late for&#160;him&#160;and&#160;me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You have other children.&#160;Honor Luke&#160;by&#160;recognizing&#160;them. All the gods can do&#160;that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes's&#160;shoulders sagged. &#34;They'll&#160;try,&#160;Percy.&#160;Oh, we'll all try&#160;to&#160;keep our promise. And&#160;maybe for a&#160;<br/>
while things&#160;will get better. But we&#160;gods have never&#160;been good at&#160;keeping oaths.&#160;You were born because&#160;<br/>of a broken&#160;promise, eh? Eventually&#160;we'll<i>&#160;</i>become forgetful. We always&#160;do.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You can change.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes laughed. &#34;After three thousand&#160;years, you think the gods can change their nature?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=189></a>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said. &#34;I do.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes seemed surprised by&#160;that. &#34;You think&#160;. . .&#160;Luke actually&#160;loved me? After all that happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;sure of it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Hermes stared at the fountain. &#34;I'll give&#160;you&#160;a list of&#160;my&#160;children.&#160;There's a boy in Wisconsin. Two&#160;<br/>
girls in Los Angeles. A few others. Will&#160;you see that they&#160;get to camp?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I promise,&#34; I said. &#34;And I&#160;won't forget.&#34;&#160;<br/>
George and&#160;Martha twirled around the&#160;caduceus. I&#160;know snakes can't smile, but they&#160;seemed to be&#160;<br/>
trying.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy&#160;Jackson,&#34; Hermes&#160;said, &#34;you might just teach&#160;us a thing&#160;or two.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Another god&#160;was&#160;waiting for me on the&#160;way&#160;out of Olympus. Athena stood in the&#160;middle of the road with&#160;<br/>her arms&#160;crossed and a look&#160;on&#160;her face that made&#160;me think&#160;<i>Uh-oh.&#160;</i>She'd changed out&#160;of her armor, into&#160;<br/>jeans and a white blouse, but she didn't look any less warlike. Her&#160;gray&#160;eyes blazed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, Percy,&#34; she said. &#34;You will stay&#160;mortal.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Um,&#160;yes,&#160;ma'am.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I would know&#160;your reasons.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I want to be&#160;a regular guy.&#160;I want to grow&#160;up. Have,&#160;you know, a regular high&#160;school experience.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And my&#160;daughter?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I couldn't leave her,&#34; I admitted,&#160;my&#160;throat dry.&#160;&#34;Or&#160;Grover,&#34; I added quickly.&#160;&#34;Or—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Spare&#160;me.&#34; Athena stepped close to&#160;me, and I could feel her&#160;aura of power&#160;making my&#160;skin itch. &#34;I&#160;<br/>
once warned&#160;you, Percy&#160;Jackson, that to save a friend&#160;you would destroy&#160;the world. Perhaps I was&#160;<br/>mistaken. You seem&#160;to have saved both&#160;your friends&#160;and the world. But think&#160;very&#160;carefully&#160;about&#160;how&#160;<br/>you&#160;proceed from&#160;here. I have given&#160;you the benefit of the doubt.&#160;Don't&#160;mess up.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Just to prove&#160;her point,&#160;she erupted in a&#160;column&#160;of flame, charring the front of my&#160;shirt.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Annabeth was waiting for&#160;me at the elevator. &#34;Why&#160;do&#160;you smell like smoke?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Long story,&#34;&#160;I said. Together we&#160;made&#160;our way&#160;down to&#160;the street level. Neither of us said&#160;a word.&#160;<br/>
The music was awful—Neil Diamond or&#160;something.&#160;I should've made that part of my&#160;gift from&#160;the gods:&#160;<br/>better elevator tunes.&#160;<br/>
When we got into the lobby, I found my&#160;mother and Paul arguing with the bald security&#160;guy, who'd&#160;<br/>
returned to his post.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm telling you,&#34; my&#160;mom yelled, &#34;we have to go&#160;up! My&#160;son—&#34; Then she saw&#160;me and&#160;her eyes&#160;<br/>
widened. &#34;Percy!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She hugged the breath right out of&#160;me.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We saw the building lit up blue,&#34; she said. &#34;But then you didn't&#160;come&#160;down. You went up&#160;<i>hours&#160;</i><br/>
ago!&#34; &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=190></a>&#34;She was getting a bit anxious,&#34; Paul said drily.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;all right,&#34;&#160;I promised&#160;as&#160;my&#160;mom&#160;hugged Annabeth. &#34;Everything's okay&#160;now.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Mr. Blofis,&#34;&#160;Annabeth said, &#34;that was wicked sword work.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Paul shrugged. &#34;It seemed&#160;like the thing&#160;to do. But Percy,&#160;is this really&#160;. . . I mean, this story&#160;about the&#160;<br/>
six hundredth&#160;floor?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Olympus,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Yeah.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Paul looked at&#160;the ceiling&#160;with a dreamy expression.&#160;&#34;I'd&#160;like to see that.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Paul,&#34; my&#160;mom&#160;chided. &#34;It's not for mortals. Anyway, the important thing is we're&#160;safe. All of&#160;us.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was&#160;about to relax. Everything felt perfect. Annabeth and I were okay.&#160;My&#160;mom&#160;and&#160;Paul had&#160;<br/>
survived. Olympus was saved.&#160;<br/>
But the life of a demigod is never&#160;so easy.&#160;Just then&#160;Nico ran in&#160;from the&#160;street, and his face&#160;told me&#160;<br/>
something was wrong.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's Rachel,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;I just&#160;ran into&#160;her down on&#160;32nd&#160;Street.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth frowned. &#34;What's she done this&#160;time?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's where she's gone,&#34; Nico said. &#34;I told her she&#160;would die<i>&#160;</i>if she&#160;tried, but she insisted. She&#160;just took&#160;<br/>
Blackjack and—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;She took&#160;my&#160;pegasus?&#34; I&#160;demanded.&#160;<br/>
Nico nodded.&#160;&#34;She's&#160;heading to Half-Blood Hill. She&#160;said she had to get to camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
TWENTY-TWO&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
I &#160;AM &#160;DUMPED&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Nobody&#160;steals&#160;my&#160;pegasus. Not even Rachel. I wasn't&#160;sure if I was&#160;more angry&#160;or&#160;amazed or worried.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What was she thinking?&#34;&#160;Annabeth said as we ran&#160;for the river.&#160;Unfortunately, I had a pretty good&#160;<br/>
idea, and it filled me with dread.&#160;<br/>
The traffic was horrible. Everybody was out on&#160;the&#160;streets gawking at the war zone damage. Police&#160;<br/>
sirens wailed&#160;on every&#160;block. There was&#160;no possibility&#160;of catching a cab, and the&#160;pegasi had flown away. I&#160;<br/>would've settled for some Party&#160;Ponies, but they&#160;had disappeared along with&#160;most of the root beer in&#160;<br/>Midtown. So&#160;we ran, pushing&#160;through mobs of dazed&#160;mortals that clogged the sidewalks.&#160;<br/>
&#34;She'll never get through the defenses,&#34;&#160;Annabeth said. &#34;Peleus will eat her.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I hadn't considered that. The Mist wouldn't fool Rachel like it would most people. She'd be able to&#160;<br/>
find the camp&#160;no problem, but I'd been hoping&#160;the magical boundaries would just&#160;keep her out&#160;like a force&#160;<br/>field. It hadn't occurred to&#160;me that Peleus&#160;might attack.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=191></a>&#34;We've got to hurry.&#34; I glanced at Nico. &#34;I don't suppose you could conjure up some skeleton horses.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He wheezed&#160;as he ran. &#34;So tired . . . couldn't summon a dog bone.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Finally&#160;we scrambled over the embankment to the&#160;shore, and I let out a loud whistle. I hated doing it.&#160;<br/>
Even with the sand dollar I'd given the East River&#160;for a&#160;magic&#160;cleaning, the water here&#160;was&#160;pretty&#160;<br/>polluted. I didn't want to&#160;make any&#160;sea animals sick, but they&#160;came to my&#160;call.&#160;<br/>
Three wake&#160;lines appeared in the gray&#160;water,&#160;and a pod of hippocampi broke the surface. They&#160;<br/>
whinnied unhappily,&#160;shaking the river muck from their manes.&#160;They&#160;were beautiful creatures, with&#160;<br/>multicolored&#160;fish tails, and&#160;the heads&#160;and forelegs of&#160;white stallions. The hippocampus in front was&#160;much&#160;<br/>bigger than the others—a ride fit for a Cyclops.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rainbow!&#34; I called. &#34;How's&#160;it going, buddy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He neighed a complaint.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah, I'm sorry,&#34; I said. &#34;But it's an emergency.&#160;We&#160;need to get to camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He snorted.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tyson?&#34; I said. &#34;Tyson&#160;is&#160;fine! I'm&#160;sorry he's&#160;not&#160;here. He's&#160;a big general now in the Cyclops&#160;army.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;NEEEEIGGGGH!&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah, I'm sure he'll still bring&#160;you apples. Now, about&#160;that ride . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
In no time,&#160;Annabeth, Nico, and I were zipping up the&#160;East River faster than Jet Skis. We sped under&#160;<br/>
the Throgs Neck Bridge and headed for&#160;Long Island&#160;Sound.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
It seemed like forever until we saw the beach at camp. We thanked the&#160;hippocampi and&#160;waded ashore,&#160;<br/>only&#160;to&#160;find&#160;Argus waiting for us. He stood in&#160;the sand with his arms crossed, his hundred eyes glaring at&#160;<br/>us.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is she here?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
He nodded grimly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Is everything&#160;okay?&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>
Argus shook&#160;his head.&#160;<br/>
We followed him&#160;up the trail. It was&#160;surreal being back at camp, because everything looked so&#160;<br/>
peaceful: no burning buildings, no wounded fighters.&#160;The cabins were bright in the sunshine, and the&#160;<br/>fields glittered with dew.&#160;But the place was&#160;mostly&#160;empty.&#160;<br/>
Up at the Big&#160;House, something&#160;was definitely&#160;wrong.&#160;Green light&#160;was shooting&#160;out all the windows,&#160;<br/>
just like I'd seen in&#160;my&#160;dream about May&#160;Castellan. Mist—the&#160;magical kind—swirled around the yard.&#160;<br/>Chiron lay&#160;on&#160;a horse-size stretcher by&#160;the volleyball pit, a bunch of satyrs standing around him.&#160;<br/>Blackjack cantered nervously&#160;in the grass.&#160;<br/>
<i>Don't&#160;blame me, boss!&#160;</i>he&#160;pleaded when he saw&#160;me.&#160;<i>The weird girl made me do it!</i>&#160;<br/>
Rachel Elizabeth Dare stood at&#160;the bottom&#160;of the&#160;porch steps.&#160;Her arms were raised like she was&#160;<br/>
waiting for someone inside the house to throw her a ball.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=192></a>&#34;What's she doing?&#34; Annabeth demanded. &#34;How did she get past the barriers?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;She flew,&#34; one of the satyrs said,&#160;looking accusingly&#160;at Blackjack. &#34;Right&#160;past the dragon, right&#160;<br/>
through the&#160;magic boundaries.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel!&#34; I called, but the&#160;satyrs stopped me&#160;when I tried to go&#160;any closer.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy, don't,&#34; Chiron warned. He winced as he&#160;tried to move.&#160;His left&#160;arm&#160;was in a sling, his two&#160;<br/>
back legs were&#160;in splints, and his head was wrapped in bandages. &#34;You can't&#160;interrupt.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I thought&#160;you explained things to&#160;her!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I did. And I&#160;invited her here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I stared at him&#160;in disbelief. &#34;You said&#160;you'd never let anyone try&#160;again! You said—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I know what I said, Percy. But I was wrong. Rachel had a vision about the&#160;curse of Hades. She&#160;<br/>
believes it&#160;may be lifted now. She convinced me she&#160;deserves a&#160;chance.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And if the curse&#160;<i>isn't&#160;</i>lifted?&#160;If Hades hasn't gotten to that&#160;yet, she'll&#160;go crazy!&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Mist swirled around Rachel. She shivered like she was going into shock.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey!&#34; I shouted. &#34;Stop!&#34;&#160;<br/>
I ran toward&#160;her, ignoring&#160;the satyrs. I got within&#160;ten feet&#160;and hit something like an invisible beach&#160;<br/>
ball. I bounced back and landed in the grass.&#160;<br/>
Rachel opened her eyes and turned. She&#160;looked like she was sleepwalking—like she could see&#160;me,&#160;<br/>
but only&#160;in&#160;a&#160;dream.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's all right.&#34; Her voice sounded far away. &#34;This is&#160;why&#160;I've come.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You'll be destroyed!&#34;&#160;<br/>
She shook&#160;her head. &#34;This&#160;is where I belong, Percy.&#160;I&#160;finally understand why.&#34;&#160;<br/>
It sounded&#160;too much like what May&#160;Castellan had said.&#160;I&#160;had to&#160;stop her,&#160;but&#160;I&#160;couldn't even get to my&#160;<br/>
feet.&#160;<br/>
The house rumbled. The door flew open and green light poured out. I recognized the warm&#160;musty&#160;<br/>
smell of snakes.&#160;<br/>
Mist curled into a hundred smoky&#160;serpents, slithering up the porch&#160;columns,&#160;curling around the house.&#160;<br/>
Then the Oracle appeared in&#160;the doorway.&#160;<br/>
The withered mummy&#160;shuffled forward in her rainbow dress. She looked even&#160;worse than usual,&#160;<br/>
which is saying a lot. Her hair was falling out&#160;in clumps. Her leathery&#160;skin was cracking like the seat of a&#160;<br/>worn-out bus. Her glassy&#160;eyes stared blankly&#160;into&#160;space, but I got the creepiest feeling she was being&#160;<br/>drawn straight toward Rachel.&#160;<br/>
Rachel held out her arms. She didn't look scared.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You've waited too long,&#34;&#160;Rachel&#160;said. &#34;But I'm&#160;here now.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The sun blazed&#160;more brightly. A&#160;man&#160;appeared above&#160;the porch, floating in the air—a blond dude in&#160;a&#160;<br/>
white toga, with sunglasses and a cocky&#160;smile.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Apollo,&#34; I&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=193></a>He winked at me but held up&#160;his finger to&#160;his lips.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel Elizabeth Dare,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#160;have the gift&#160;of prophecy.&#160;But it is also&#160;a curse. Are&#160;you sure&#160;<br/>
you want this?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel nodded. &#34;It's&#160;my&#160;destiny.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Do&#160;you accept the risks?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I do.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then proceed,&#34; the god said.&#160;<br/>
Rachel&#160;closed&#160;her eyes. &#34;I accept this role. I pledge&#160;myself to&#160;Apollo, God of Oracles. I open&#160;my&#160;eyes&#160;<br/>
to the future&#160;and embrace&#160;the past.&#160;I accept the spirit of Delphi,&#160;Voice of the Gods, Speaker of Riddles,&#160;<br/>Seer of Fate.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I didn't know where she was getting the&#160;words, but they flowed out of&#160;her as the Mist thickened. A&#160;<br/>
green column&#160;of smoke, like a huge python,&#160;uncoiled from&#160;the&#160;mummy's&#160;mouth and slithered down the&#160;<br/>stairs, curling affectionately&#160;around Rachel's&#160;feet. The Oracle's&#160;mummy&#160;crumbled, falling away&#160;until it&#160;<br/>was nothing&#160;but a pile of&#160;dust in an old tie-dyed&#160;dress. Mist enveloped Rachel in a column.&#160;<br/>
For a moment&#160;I couldn't see her at all. Then the smoke cleared.&#160;<br/>
Rachel collapsed and curled into the fetal position.&#160;Annabeth, Nico, and&#160;I rushed&#160;forward, but&#160;Apollo&#160;<br/>
said, &#34;Stop! This is the most&#160;delicate part.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What's going on?&#34; I&#160;demanded. &#34;What&#160;do&#160;you mean?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Apollo studied&#160;Rachel with concern. &#34;Either the spirit takes hold, or&#160;it doesn't.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And if it doesn't?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Five syllables,&#34; Apollo said, counting them&#160;on his fingers.&#160;<i>&#34;That would&#160;be real bad.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
Despite Apollo's&#160;warning, I ran forward and knelt over Rachel. The smell of the attic was gone. The&#160;<br/>
Mist sank into&#160;the ground&#160;and the green light faded.&#160;But Rachel was still pale. She was barely&#160;breathing.&#160;<br/>
Then her eyes fluttered open. She focused on me&#160;with&#160;difficulty.&#160;&#34;Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you okay?&#34;&#160;<br/>
She tried to sit up. &#34;Ow.&#34; She pressed her hands to her temples.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel,&#34; Nico&#160;said, &#34;your&#160;life aura almost faded completely. I could&#160;<i>see&#160;</i>you dying.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;all right,&#34; she murmured. &#34;Please, help me up. The visions—they're a little disorienting.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Are you sure&#160;you're okay?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
Apollo drifted down from the porch. &#34;Ladies and&#160;gentlemen,&#160;may&#160;I introduce the new&#160;Oracle of&#160;<br/>
Delphi.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're kidding,&#34; Annabeth&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
Rachel&#160;managed a weak smile. &#34;It's a little surprising&#160;to&#160;me&#160;too,&#160;but this is&#160;my&#160;fate. I saw&#160;it when&#160;I&#160;<br/>
was in New York. I know why I was born with true&#160;sight. I was meant to become the Oracle.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I blinked.&#160;&#34;You mean you&#160;can tell the future now?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not all the time,&#34; she said. &#34;But&#160;there are visions, images, words&#160;in my&#160;mind. When someone asks&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=194></a>me a question, I . . . Oh no—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's starting,&#34; Apollo announced.&#160;<br/>
Rachel doubled over like someone had punched her.&#160;Then she stood up straight&#160;and her eyes glowed&#160;<br/>
serpent green.&#160;<br/>
When she spoke, her voice<i>&#160;</i>sounded tripled—like three Rachels were talking at once:&#160;<br/>
<i>&#34;Seven half-bloods shall&#160;answer the call.</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>To storm or fire, the world must fall.</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>An oath to keep with a final breath,</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>And foes bear&#160;arms to the Doors of Death.&#34;</i>&#160;<br/>
At the last word, Rachel collapsed. Nico and I caught her and helped her to the porch. Her skin was&#160;<br/>
feverish.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm&#160;all right,&#34;&#160;she said, her voice returning to&#160;normal.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What was that?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
She shook&#160;her head, confused. &#34;What was what?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I believe,&#34; Apollo said,&#160;&#34;that we just heard the next&#160;Great Prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What does it&#160;mean?&#34; I demanded.&#160;<br/>
Rachel frowned. &#34;I don't even remember&#160;what I said.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; Apollo&#160;mused. &#34;The spirit will only&#160;speak through&#160;you occasionally. The rest of the time, our&#160;<br/>
Rachel will be&#160;much as she's always&#160;been. There's no&#160;point in grilling her, even if she has just issued the&#160;<br/>next big&#160;prediction for the future of the world.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; I said. &#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Percy,&#34; Apollo said, &#34;I wouldn't worry too much. The last Great Prophecy&#160;about&#160;<i>you&#160;&#160;</i>took almost&#160;<br/>
seventy&#160;years to complete.&#160;This one may&#160;not even&#160;happen in&#160;your lifetime.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I thought about the lines Rachel had spoken in that creepy&#160;voice:<i>&#160;</i>about storm&#160;and fire and the Doors&#160;<br/>
of Death. &#34;Maybe,&#34; I&#160;said,&#160;&#34;but it&#160;didn't&#160;sound so&#160;good.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No,&#34; said Apollo cheerfully. &#34;It certainly didn't. She's going&#160;to make a wonderful Oracle!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
It was hard to drop&#160;the subject, but Apollo insisted&#160;that Rachel needed to rest, and she did&#160;look pretty&#160;<br/>disoriented.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm sorry, Percy,&#34; she said. &#34;Back on Olympus, I didn't explain everything to you, but the&#160;calling&#160;<br/>
frightened me. I didn't&#160;think&#160;you'd understand.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I still don't,&#34; I admitted. &#34;But I guess I'm&#160;happy&#160;for&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Rachel smiled. &#34;Happy probably&#160;isn't the right word. Seeing the future isn't&#160;going to be&#160;easy, but it's&#160;<br/>
my&#160;destiny. I&#160;only&#160;hope my&#160;family&#160;. .&#160;.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She didn't finish her thought.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Will&#160;you still go to Clarion Academy?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=195></a>&#34;I made a promise to&#160;my&#160;father. I guess I'll try&#160;to&#160;be a normal kid during the school&#160;year, but—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;But right now you need sleep,&#34; Apollo&#160;scolded. &#34;Chiron, I don't think the attic is the proper place for&#160;<br/>
our new Oracle, do&#160;you?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;No, indeed.&#34;&#160;Chiron&#160;looked a lot&#160;better now that&#160;Apollo&#160;had worked some&#160;medical&#160;magic&#160;on him.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Rachel&#160;may&#160;use a guest room&#160;in the Big House for now, until we give the matter&#160;more thought.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'm thinking a cave in the hills,&#34; Apollo mused. &#34;With torches and a big purple curtain over the&#160;<br/>
entrance . . .&#160;really&#160;mysterious. But inside, a totally&#160;decked-out pad with a game room&#160;and one of those&#160;<br/>home theater&#160;systems.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Chiron cleared&#160;his throat loudly.&#160;<br/>
&#34;What?&#34; Apollo demanded.&#160;<br/>
Rachel kissed&#160;me&#160;on the cheek. &#34;Good-bye, Percy,&#34; she whispered. &#34;And I don't have to see the future&#160;<br/>
to tell&#160;you what to do&#160;now,&#160;do I?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Her eyes seemed&#160;more piercing than before.&#160;<br/>
I blushed. &#34;No.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good,&#34; she said. Then she turned and&#160;followed Apollo&#160;into&#160;the Big&#160;House.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The rest of the day&#160;was as&#160;strange as&#160;the beginning.&#160;Campers&#160;trickled in from New York by&#160;car, pegasus,&#160;<br/>and chariot. The wounded&#160;were cared for. The dead&#160;were given proper funeral rites at the campfire.&#160;<br/>
Silena's shroud was hot pink, but embroidered with&#160;an electric spear. The Ares and Aphrodite cabins&#160;<br/>
both claimed&#160;her as a hero, and lit the&#160;shroud together. No one mentioned the word&#160;<i>spy.&#160;&#160;</i>That secret&#160;<br/>burned to&#160;ashes as the designer perfume&#160;smoke drifted into&#160;the sky.&#160;<br/>
Even Ethan&#160;Nakamura was given a shroud—black&#160;silk&#160;with a logo of swords crossed under a set of&#160;<br/>
scales. As his&#160;shroud went up in flames, I hoped Ethan knew he had made a difference in the end. He'd&#160;<br/>paid a lot more than an eye, but the minor gods&#160;would&#160;finally get the&#160;respect they&#160;deserved.&#160;<br/>
Dinner at the pavilion was low-key. The only&#160;highlight was Juniper the tree nymph, who screamed,&#160;<br/>
&#34;Grover!&#34; and gave her boyfriend a flying tackle&#160;hug, making everybody cheer. They&#160;went down to the&#160;<br/>beach to take a&#160;moonlit walk, and I was happy&#160;for them, though&#160;the scene reminded me of Silena and&#160;<br/>Beckendorf, which made&#160;me sad.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. O'Leary&#160;romped around happily, eating everybody's&#160;table scraps. Nico sat&#160;at the&#160;main table with&#160;<br/>
Chiron and&#160;Mr. D, and&#160;nobody seemed to&#160;think this&#160;was out of&#160;place. Everybody&#160;was patting Nico on the&#160;<br/>back, complimenting him&#160;on his fighting. Even the&#160;Ares&#160;kids seemed to think&#160;he was pretty&#160;cool. Hey,&#160;<br/>show up with&#160;an army&#160;of&#160;undead warriors to save the day,&#160;and suddenly&#160;you're everybody's best friend.&#160;<br/>
Slowly, the dinner crowd trickled away. Some went&#160;to the campfire for a sing-along. Others went to&#160;<br/>
bed. I sat at the Poseidon table by&#160;myself and watched the&#160;moonlight on Long&#160;Island Sound.&#160;I could see&#160;<br/>Grover and Juniper at the&#160;beach, holding hands and&#160;talking. It was peaceful.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey.&#34; Annabeth slid next&#160;to me&#160;on the bench. &#34;Happy&#160;birthday.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She was holding a huge misshapen cupcake with blue icing.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=196></a>I stared at her.&#160;&#34;What?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's August 18th,&#34; she said.&#160;&#34;Your birthday,&#160;right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
I was&#160;stunned. It hadn't even occurred to me, but&#160;she was right. I had turned sixteen this&#160;morning—<br/>
the same&#160;morning I'd made the choice to give Luke the knife. The prophecy&#160;had come&#160;true right on&#160;<br/>schedule, and I hadn't even thought about&#160;the fact that it was&#160;my&#160;birthday.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Make a wish,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Did&#160;you&#160;bake&#160;this yourself?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Tyson helped.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That explains&#160;why&#160;it&#160;looks&#160;like a chocolate brick,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;With extra blue cement.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth laughed.&#160;<br/>
I thought for&#160;a second, then blew out the candle.&#160;<br/>
We cut it in&#160;half and shared, eating with our&#160;fingers. Annabeth sat next to me, and we watched the&#160;<br/>
ocean. Crickets and monsters were&#160;making noise in the woods, but&#160;otherwise it was quiet.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You saved the world,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We saved the world.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;And Rachel is the new Oracle, which&#160;means she won't be dating anybody.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You don't sound&#160;disappointed,&#34; I noticed.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth shrugged. &#34;Oh,&#160;I&#160;don't care.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Uh-huh.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She raised an eyebrow. &#34;You got something to say&#160;to&#160;me, Seaweed&#160;Brain?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You'd probably&#160;kick my&#160;butt.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You&#160;<i>know&#160;</i>I'd&#160;kick your butt.&#34;&#160;<br/>
I brushed the cake off&#160;my&#160;hands. &#34;When I was at the&#160;River Styx, turning invulnerable . . .&#160;Nico said I&#160;<br/>
had to concentrate on one thing that kept&#160;me anchored&#160;to the world,&#160;that made&#160;me&#160;want to stay&#160;mortal.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth kept&#160;her eyes on&#160;the horizon.&#160;&#34;Yeah?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Then up&#160;on&#160;Olympus,&#34; I said, &#34;when they&#160;wanted to&#160;make&#160;me a god and stuff, I&#160;kept thinking—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, you&#160;so wanted&#160;to.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well,&#160;maybe a little. But I didn't, because I thought—I didn't want things to stay&#160;the same for&#160;<br/>
eternity,&#160;because things could always&#160;get better. And&#160;I was thinking . . .&#34; My&#160;throat felt really&#160;dry.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Anyone in&#160;particular?&#34; Annabeth asked, her voice soft.&#160;<br/>
I looked&#160;over&#160;and saw that she was trying&#160;not to&#160;smile.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're laughing at me,&#34; I&#160;complained.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I am&#160;not!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You are&#160;<i>so&#160;</i>not making this easy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Then she laughed for real,&#160;and she put&#160;her hands around my&#160;neck.&#160;&#34;I am&#160;never,&#160;<i>ever&#160;</i>going to make&#160;<br/>
things easy&#160;for you,&#160;Seaweed Brain. Get&#160;used to it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=197></a>When she kissed&#160;me, I had the feeling my brain was melting right&#160;through my&#160;body.&#160;<br/>
I could've stayed&#160;that way&#160;forever, except a&#160;voice behind us growled, &#34;Well, it's about time!&#34;&#160;<br/>
Suddenly&#160;the pavilion was filled&#160;with torchlight and campers. Clarisse led the way&#160;as the&#160;<br/>
eavesdroppers charged and hoisted us both onto their shoulders.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Oh, come on!&#34; I complained. &#34;Is there no privacy?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;The lovebirds need to cool&#160;off!&#34; Clarisse said with glee.&#160;<br/>
&#34;The canoe lake!&#34; Connor&#160;Stoll shouted.&#160;<br/>
With a huge&#160;cheer, they&#160;carried us down the hill,&#160;but they&#160;kept us close enough to&#160;hold hands.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth was laughing, and I couldn't&#160;help laughing too, even though my&#160;face was completely&#160;red.&#160;<br/>
We held hands right up&#160;to the moment they&#160;dumped us in the water.&#160;<br/>
Afterward, I had the last laugh. I made an air&#160;bubble at the bottom&#160;of the lake. Our friends kept&#160;<br/>
waiting for us&#160;to come&#160;up, but hey—when you're the son of Poseidon,&#160;you&#160;don't have to hurry.&#160;<br/>
And it was pretty&#160;much the best underwater kiss of all time.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
TWENTY-THREE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
WE &#160;SAY &#160;GOOD-BYE,&#160;<br/>
SORT &#160;OF&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Camp&#160;went late that summer. It lasted two&#160;more weeks, right up to<i>&#160;</i>the start of a new school&#160;year, and I&#160;<br/>have to admit&#160;they&#160;were the best two weeks of my&#160;life.&#160;<br/>
Of course, Annabeth would kill me&#160;if I said anything&#160;different, but&#160;there was a lot of&#160;other great stuff&#160;<br/>
going on too. Grover had taken over the satyr&#160;seekers&#160;and was sending them&#160;out across the&#160;world to find&#160;<br/>unclaimed half-bloods. So&#160;far, the gods had kept&#160;their promise. New demigods were popping&#160;up all over&#160;<br/>the place—not just in America, but in a lot of other countries as well.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We can hardly&#160;keep up,&#34;&#160;Grover admitted one afternoon as we were taking a break at the canoe lake.&#160;<br/>
&#34;We're going&#160;to need a bigger travel budget, and I could use a hundred&#160;more satyrs.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah, but the satyrs&#160;you&#160;<i>have&#160;</i>are working super hard,&#34; I said. &#34;I think they're scared of&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Grover blushed. &#34;That's silly. I'm&#160;not scary.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;You're a lord of the Wild,&#160;dude. The chosen one of Pan. A&#160;member of the Council of—&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Stop it!&#34;<i>&#160;</i>Grover protested. &#34;You're as&#160;bad as Juniper. I think she&#160;wants&#160;me&#160;to run for&#160;president next.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He&#160;chewed on&#160;a tin can as&#160;we&#160;stared&#160;across the&#160;pond at the line of&#160;new cabins under construction. The&#160;<br/>
U-shape would soon&#160;be a&#160;complete rectangle, and the demigods had really&#160;taken to the new task with&#160;<br/>gusto.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=198></a>Nico had some undead builders working on the Hades cabin. Even though he&#160;was&#160;still the&#160;only&#160;kid in&#160;<br/>
it, it was going to look pretty cool:&#160;solid&#160;obsidian walls with a skull&#160;over the&#160;door and torches&#160;that burned&#160;<br/>with green fire twenty-four&#160;hours a day.&#160;Next to that&#160;were the&#160;cabins of Iris, Nemesis, Hecate, and several&#160;<br/>others I didn't recognize. They&#160;kept adding new ones to&#160;the blueprints every&#160;day.&#160;It was going so well,&#160;<br/>Annabeth and Chiron were talking about adding&#160;an&#160;entirely&#160;new wing of cabins just so they&#160;could&#160;have&#160;<br/>enough room.&#160;<br/>
The Hermes&#160;cabin was a&#160;lot less crowded now, because&#160;most of the unclaimed kids had received&#160;<br/>
signs from&#160;their godly&#160;parents. It happened almost every&#160;night, and every&#160;night&#160;more demigods straggled&#160;<br/>over the property&#160;line with the satyr guides, usually&#160;with some&#160;nasty&#160;monsters&#160;pursuing them, but almost&#160;<br/>all of them&#160;made it through.&#160;<br/>
&#34;It's going to&#160;be a lot different next summer,&#34; I said. &#34;Chiron's expecting we'll have twice as&#160;many&#160;<br/>
campers.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#34; Grover agreed, &#34;but it'll be the same old place.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He sighed contentedly.&#160;<br/>
I watched as&#160;Tyson led a group of Cyclops builders.&#160;They&#160;were hoisting huge&#160;stones in place for the&#160;<br/>
Hecate cabin, and I knew it was a delicate job. Each stone was engraved with magical writing, and if they&#160;<br/>dropped&#160;one,&#160;it would either&#160;explode or&#160;turn everyone&#160;within half a mile into a tree. I figured nobody&#160;but&#160;<br/>Grover would&#160;like that.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll be traveling a lot,&#34; Grover warned, &#34;between&#160;protecting nature&#160;and finding&#160;half-bloods. I&#160;may&#160;not&#160;<br/>
see you as much.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Won't change anything,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;You're still my&#160;best friend.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He grinned. &#34;Except for Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;That's different.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yeah,&#34; he agreed. &#34;It sure is.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
In the late&#160;afternoon, I was taking one last walk along the beach&#160;when a familiar voice said, &#34;Good day&#160;<br/>for fishing.&#34;&#160;<br/>
My dad, Poseidon, was standing&#160;knee-deep in the surf, wearing his typical Bermuda shorts, beat-up&#160;<br/>
cap, and a real subtle pink-and-green Tommy&#160;Bahama shirt. He&#160;had a deep-sea fishing rod&#160;in his hands,&#160;<br/>and when he&#160;cast it the line went way&#160;out—like halfway&#160;across Long Island Sound.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Hey, Dad,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;What&#160;brings&#160;you here?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He winked. &#34;Never really&#160;got to&#160;talk in&#160;private on Olympus. I wanted to thank&#160;you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Thank me?&#160;You came&#160;to&#160;the rescue.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yes,&#160;and I got&#160;my&#160;palace&#160;destroyed in the process,&#160;but you know—palaces&#160;can be rebuilt. I've gotten&#160;<br/>
so many thank-you&#160;cards from&#160;the other gods.&#160;Even&#160;Ares wrote one, though&#160;I think&#160;Hera forced him&#160;to.&#160;<br/>It's&#160;rather gratifying. So, thank&#160;you.&#160;I suppose even the gods can learn new tricks.&#34;&#160;<br/>
The Sound began to boil. At the end of my&#160;dad's line, a huge green sea&#160;serpent erupted from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=199></a>water. It thrashed and fought,&#160;but Poseidon just sighed. Holding his fishing&#160;pole with&#160;one hand,&#160;he&#160;<br/>whipped out&#160;his knife and&#160;cut the line. The monster&#160;sank below the&#160;surface.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Not eating size,&#34; he complained. &#34;I have to release the little ones or the game wardens will be all&#160;<br/>
over me.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Little ones?&#34;&#160;<br/>
He grinned. &#34;You're doing&#160;well with those new cabins,&#160;by&#160;the way. I suppose this means I can claim&#160;<br/>
all those other sons and daughters of mine&#160;and send&#160;you some&#160;siblings next summer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Ha-ha.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Poseidon reeled in his empty line.&#160;<br/>
I shifted my&#160;feet. &#34;Um,&#160;you&#160;<i>were&#160;</i>kidding, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>
Poseidon gave&#160;me one of his inside-joke winks, and&#160;I&#160;still didn't know whether he&#160;was&#160;serious or not.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I'll see you&#160;soon, Percy.&#160;And remember, know&#160;which&#160;fish are big enough to land,&#160;eh?&#34;&#160;<br/>
With that he&#160;dissolved in the sea breeze,&#160;leaving a fishing&#160;pole lying in the sand.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
That evening was the last&#160;night&#160;of camp—the bead&#160;ceremony.&#160;The Hephaestus cabin had designed the&#160;<br/>bead this year. It showed the Empire State Building,&#160;and etched in tiny&#160;Greek letters, spiraling around the&#160;<br/>image, were&#160;the names of&#160;all the heroes who had died&#160;defending&#160;Olympus. There were too many&#160;names,&#160;<br/>but I was proud to wear the bead. I put it on my&#160;camp&#160;necklace—four beads now. I felt like an old-timer.&#160;I&#160;<br/>thought about the first campfire I'd&#160;ever attended, back when I was twelve,&#160;and how I'd&#160;felt so at home.&#160;<br/>That at least&#160;hadn't changed.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Never forget this summer!&#34; Chiron told us. He had healed remarkably&#160;well, but he still trotted in&#160;<br/>
front of the fire with a slight limp. &#34;We&#160;have discovered bravery&#160;and friendship and courage this summer.&#160;<br/>We have upheld the honor&#160;of the camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>
He smiled at me, and everybody cheered. As I looked&#160;at the fire,&#160;I saw a little girl in a&#160;brown dress&#160;<br/>
tending the flames. She&#160;winked at&#160;me&#160;with red glowing eyes. No one else&#160;seemed to notice her, but I&#160;<br/>realized&#160;maybe she preferred it that way.&#160;<br/>
&#34;And now,&#34;&#160;Chiron said,&#160;&#34;early&#160;to bed!&#160;Remember, you must vacate your cabins by&#160;noon tomorrow&#160;<br/>
unless you've made arrangements to stay&#160;the&#160;year with us. The cleaning harpies will eat any&#160;stragglers,&#160;<br/>and I'd hate to end the summer on a sour note!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The next morning, Annabeth and I stood at the&#160;top of Half-Blood&#160;Hill. We watched the buses and vans&#160;<br/>pull away, taking most of the campers&#160;back to the real world. A few old-timers would be staying&#160;behind,&#160;<br/>and a few of the newcomers, but I was&#160;heading back to Goode High School for&#160;my&#160;sophomore year—the&#160;<br/>first time&#160;in my&#160;life I'd ever done two&#160;years at the same school.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Good-bye,&#34;&#160;Rachel&#160;said to us as she shouldered her bag. She looked pretty&#160;nervous, but she was&#160;<br/>
keeping a promise to her father and attending&#160;Clarion Academy in New Hampshire. It would be&#160;next&#160;<br/>summer before we got our&#160;Oracle back.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=200></a>&#34;You'll do great.&#34; Annabeth hugged her.&#160;Funny, she&#160;seemed to get&#160;along fine with&#160;Rachel these days.&#160;<br/>
Rachel bit her lip. &#34;I hope you're right. I'm a little&#160;worried. What if somebody&#160;asks what's&#160;on the next&#160;<br/>
math test and I start&#160;spouting a prophecy&#160;in the&#160;middle of geometry&#160;class?&#160;<i>The Pythagorean&#160;theorem shall&#160;</i><br/>
<i>be problem two.&#160;</i>. . . Gods, that would&#160;be embarrassing.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Annabeth laughed, and&#160;to&#160;my&#160;relief, it made Rachel&#160;smile.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well,&#34; she said, &#34;you two&#160;be good to each other.&#34; Go figure, but&#160;she looked at&#160;<i>me&#160;</i>like I&#160;was some&#160;<br/>
kind of troublemaker.&#160;Before I could protest, Rachel&#160;wished us&#160;well and ran&#160;down the hill to catch her&#160;<br/>ride.&#160;<br/>
Annabeth, thank goodness, would be&#160;staying in New York. She'd&#160;gotten permission from&#160;her parents&#160;<br/>
to attend a boarding school in the city so she&#160;could be close&#160;to Olympus and oversee the rebuilding&#160;<br/>efforts.&#160;<br/>
&#34;And close to me?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Well, someone's got a big sense of his&#160;own importance.&#34; But she laced her fingers through&#160;mine.&#160;I&#160;<br/>
remembered what she'd told me in New York, about building something permanent, and&#160;I thought—just&#160;<br/>maybe—we&#160;were off to a good&#160;start.&#160;<br/>
The guard dragon Peleus curled contentedly around&#160;the pine tree underneath the Golden Fleece and&#160;<br/>
began to snore, blowing steam&#160;with every breath.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You've been&#160;thinking about Rachel's prophecy?&#34;&#160;I asked Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
She frowned.&#160;&#34;How did&#160;you know?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Because I know you.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She bumped&#160;me&#160;with her shoulder. &#34;Okay,&#160;so I have.&#160;<i>Seven half-bloods shall answer the call.&#160;</i>I&#160;<br/>
wonder who they'll be. We're going to&#160;have so many&#160;new faces next summer.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Yep,&#34; I agreed. &#34;And all that stuff about the world falling in storm or fire.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She pursed her lips. &#34;And&#160;foes at the Doors of Death.&#160;I don't know, Percy,&#160;but I&#160;don't like it.&#160;I&#160;thought&#160;<br/>
. . . well, maybe we'd&#160;get some&#160;<i>peace&#160;</i>for a change.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Wouldn't&#160;be Camp&#160;Half-Blood if it&#160;was peaceful,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;I guess you're right . .&#160;. Or maybe the prophecy&#160;won't happen for&#160;years.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#34;Could&#160;be a&#160;problem&#160;for another generation of&#160;demigods,&#34; I agreed. &#34;Then&#160;we can kick back and&#160;<br/>
enjoy.&#34;&#160;<br/>
She nodded, though she still seemed uneasy. I didn't blame her, but it was hard to feel too upset on a&#160;<br/>
nice day,&#160;with&#160;her next to&#160;me, knowing&#160;that I wasn't&#160;really&#160;saying&#160;good-bye.&#160;We had lots of time.&#160;<br/>
&#34;Race you to&#160;the road?&#34;&#160;I said.&#160;<br/>
&#34;You are so going to&#160;lose.&#34;&#160;She took&#160;off&#160;down Half-Blood Hill and I&#160;sprinted after her.&#160;<br/>
For once, I didn't look back.&#160;<br/>
