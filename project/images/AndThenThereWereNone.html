&#160;AGATHA CHRISTIE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 1<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;IN THE CORNER of a first-class smoking carriage, Mr. Justice Wargrave,<br/>
&#160;lately&#160;retired from the bench, puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye<br/>
&#160;through the&#160;political news in the Times.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He laid the paper down and glanced out of the window. They were running now<br/>
&#160;&#160;through Somerset. He glanced at his watch-another two hours to go.&#160;&#160;He went<br/>
&#160;over in his mind all that had appeared in the papers about Indian Island.&#160;<br/>
&#160;There had been its original purchase by an American millionaire who was crazy<br/>
&#160;&#160;about yachting-and an account of the luxurious modern house he had built on<br/>
&#160;this&#160;&#160;little island off the Devon coast. The unfortunate fact that the new<br/>
&#160;third wife&#160;&#160;of the American millionaire was a bad sailor had led to the<br/>
&#160;subsequent putting&#160;&#160;up of the house and island for sale. Various glowing<br/>
&#160;advertisements of it had&#160;&#160;appeared in the papers. Then came the first bald<br/>
&#160;statement that it had been&#160;&#160;bought-by a Mr. Owen. After that the rurnours<br/>
&#160;of the gossip writers had started.&#160;&#160;Indian Island had really been bought by<br/>
&#160;Miss Gabrielle Turl, the Hollywood film&#160;&#160;star! She wanted to spend some<br/>
&#160;months there free from all publicity! Busy Bee had&#160;&#160;hinted delicately that<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2></a>&#160;it was to be an abode for Royalty??! Mr. Merryweather had&#160;&#160;had it whispered<br/>
&#160;to him that it had been bought for a honeymoon-Young Lord L--&#160;had<br/>
&#160;surrendered to Cupid at last! Jonas knew for a fact that it had been&#160;<br/>
&#160;purchased by the Admiralty with a view to carrying out some very hush hush<br/>
&#160;&#160;experiments!<br/>
&#160;&#160;Definitely, Indian Island was news!<br/>
&#160;&#160;From his pocket Mr. Justice Wargrave drew out a letter. The handwriting was<br/>
&#160;&#160;practically illegible but words here and there stood out with unexpected<br/>
&#160;clarity.&#160;&#160;Dearest Lawrence . . . such years since I heard anything of you<br/>
&#160;. . . must come&#160;&#160;to Indian Island . . . the most enchanting place . . . so<br/>
&#160;much to talk over . .&#160;&#160;. old days . . . communion with Nature . . . bask<br/>
&#160;in sunshine . . . 12.40 from Paddington . . .&#160;meet you at Oakbridge . . .<br/>
&#160;and his correspondent signed herself with<br/>
&#160;a flourish&#160;his ever Constance Culmington.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave cast back in his mind to remember when exactly he had<br/>
&#160;last&#160;&#160;seen Lady Constance Culmington. It must be seven -no, eight years ago.<br/>
&#160;She had&#160;&#160;then been going to Italy to bask in the sun and be at one with<br/>
&#160;Nature and the&#160;&#160;contaditd. Later, he had heard, she had proceeded to Syria<br/>
&#160;where she proposed to&#160;&#160;bask in yet stronger sun and live at one with Nature<br/>
&#160;and the bedouin.&#160;&#160;Constance Culmington, he reflected to himself, was exactly<br/>
&#160;the sort of woman who&#160;&#160;would buy an island and surround herself with<br/>
&#160;mystery! Nodding his head in gentle&#160;&#160;approval of his logic, Mr. Justice<br/>
&#160;Wargrave allowed his head to nod.&#160;He slept. . . .<br/>

&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3></a>&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne, in a third-class carriage with five other travellers in<br/>
&#160;it,&#160;&#160;leaned her head back and shut her eyes. How hot it was travelling by<br/>
&#160;train&#160;&#160;to-day! It would be nice to get to the sea! Really a great piece of<br/>
&#160;luck getting&#160;&#160;this job. When you wanted a holiday post it nearly always<br/>
&#160;meant looking after a&#160;&#160;swarm of children-secretarial holiday posts were much<br/>
&#160;more difficult to get. Even&#160;&#160;the agency hadn't held out much hope.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then the letter had come.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I have received your name from the Skilled Women's Agency together with<br/>
&#160;their&#160;&#160;recommendation. I understand they know you personally. I shall be<br/>
&#160;glad to pay you&#160;&#160;the salary you ask and shall expect you to take up your<br/>
&#160;duties on August 8th. The&#160;&#160;train is the 12.40 from Paddington and you will<br/>
&#160;be met at Oakbridge station. I&#160;&#160;enclose five pound notes for expenses.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Yours truly,<br/>
&#160;&#160;Una Nancy Owen.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And at the top was the stamped address Indian Island, Sticklehaven,&#160;Devon.<br/>
&#160;. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Indian Island! Why, there had been nothing else in the papers lately! All<br/>
&#160;&#160;sorts of hints and interesting rumours. Though probably<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;193<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;that was mostly untrue. But the house had certainly been built by a<br/>
&#160;millionaire&#160;and was said to be absolutely the last word in luxury.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne, tired by a recent strenuous term at school, thought to&#160;<br/>
&#160;herself-&#34;Being a games mistress in a third-class school isn't much of a<br/>
&#160;catch.&#160;school.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then, with a cold feeling round her heart, she thought: &#34;But I'm lucky<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;have even this. After all, people don't like a Coroner's Inquest, even<br/>
&#160;if the&#160;&#160;Coroner did acquit me of all blame!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He had even complimented her on her presence of mind and courage, she<br/>
&#160;remembered.&#160;&#160;For an inquest it couldn't have gone better. And Mrs. Hamilton<br/>
&#160;had been kindness&#160;&#160;itself to her- Only Hugo(but she wouldn't think of Hugo!)<br/>
&#160;&#160;Suddenly, in spite of the heat in the carriage she shivered and wished she<br/>
&#160;wasn't&#160;&#160;going to the sea. A picture rose clearly before her mind. Cyril's<br/>
&#160;head, bobbing&#160;&#160;up and down, swimming to the rock. . . . Up and down-up and<br/>
&#160;down. . . . And&#160;&#160;herself, swimming in easy practised strokes after him-<br/>
&#160;cleaving her way through&#160;&#160;the water but knowing, only too surely, that she<br/>
&#160;wouldn't be in time. . . .&#160;&#160;The sea-its deep warm blue-mornings spent lying<br/>
&#160;out on the sands-Hugo-Hugo who&#160;&#160;had said he loved her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She must not think of Hugo. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She opened her eyes and frowned across at the man opposite her. A tall man<br/>
&#160;with&#160;&#160;a brown face, light eyes set rather close together and an arrogant<br/>
&#160;almost cruel&#160;&#160;mouth.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She thought to herself:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I bet he's been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some<br/>
&#160;interesting&#160;&#160;things. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. If only I could get a job at some decent<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard, summing up the girl opposite in a mere flash of<br/>
&#160;&#160;his quick moving eyes thought to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Quite attractive-a bit schoolmistressy perhaps.<br/>
&#160;&#160;A cool customer, he should imagine-and one who could hold her<br/>
&#160;&#160;own-in love or war. He'd rather like to take her on. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;He frowned. No, cut out all that kind of stuff. This was business. He'd got<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;keep his mind on the job.<br/>
&#160;&#160;194&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;What exactly was up, he wondered? That little Jew had been damned<br/>
&#160;mysterious.&#160;&#160;&#34;Take it or leave it, Captain Lombard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He had said thoughtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A hundred guineas, eh?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He had said it in a casual way as though a hundred guineas was nothing to<br/>
&#160;him.&#160;&#160;A hundred guineas when he was literally down to his last square meal!<br/>
&#160;He had&#160;&#160;fancied, though, that the little Jew had not been deceived-that was<br/>
&#160;the damnable&#160;&#160;part about Jews, you couldn't deceive them about money-they<br/>
&#160;knewl<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>&#160;&#160;He had said in the same casual tone:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And you can't give me any further information?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Isaac Morris had shaken his little bald head very positively.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, Captain Lombard, the matter rests there. It is understood by my client<br/>
&#160;that&#160;&#160;your reputation is that of a good man in a tight place. I am empowered<br/>
&#160;to hand&#160;&#160;you one hundred guineas in return for which you will travel to<br/>
&#160;Sticklehaven,&#160;&#160;Devon. The nearest station is Oakbridge, you will be met<br/>
&#160;there and motored to&#160;&#160;Sticklehaven where a motor launch will convey you to<br/>
&#160;Indian Island. There you&#160;&#160;will hold yourself at the disposal of my client.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard had said abruptly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;For how long?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not longer than a week at most.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Fingering his small moustache, Captain Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You understand I can't undertake anything-illegal?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He had darted a very sharp glance at the other as he had spoken. There had<br/>
&#160;been&#160;&#160;a very faint smile on the thick Semitic lips of Mr. Morris as he<br/>
&#160;answered&#160;&#160;gravely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If anything illegal is proposed, you will, of course, be at perfect<br/>
&#160;liberty to&#160;&#160;withdraw.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Damn the smooth little brute, he had smiled! It was as though he knew very<br/>
&#160;well&#160;&#160;that in Lombard's past actions legality had not always been a sine qua<br/>
&#160;non. .&#160;&#160;Lombard's own lips parted in a grin.<br/>
&#160;&#160;By Jove, he'd sailed pretty near the wind once or twice! But he'd always<br/>
&#160;got away&#160;&#160;with it! There wasn't much he drew the line at really. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;No, there wasn't much he'd draw the fine at. He fancied that he was going<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;enjoy himself at Indian Island. . . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;195<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;In a non-smoking carriage Miss Emily Brent sat very upright as was her<br/>
&#160;custom.&#160;&#160;She was sixty-five and she did not approve of lounging. Her father,<br/>
&#160;a Colonel of&#160;&#160;the old school, had been particular about deportment.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The present generation was shamelessly lax-in their carriage, and in every<br/>
&#160;other&#160;&#160;way.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Enveloped in an aura of righteousness and unyielding principles, Miss Brent<br/>
&#160;sat&#160;&#160;in her crowded third-class carriage and triumphed over its discomfort<br/>
&#160;and its&#160;&#160;heat. Every one made such a fuss over things nowadays! They wanted<br/>
&#160;injections&#160;&#160;before they had teeth pulled -they took drugs if they couldn't<br/>
&#160;sleep-they wanted&#160;&#160;easy chairs and cushions and the girls allowed their<br/>
&#160;figures to slop about anyhow&#160;&#160;and lay about half naked on the beaches in<br/>
&#160;summer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent's lips set closely. She would like to make an example of certain<br/>
&#160;&#160;people.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She remembered last year's summer holiday. This year, however, it would be<br/>
&#160;quite&#160;&#160;different. Indian Island. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mentally she reread the letter which she had already read so many times.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>&#160;&#160;Dear Miss Brent,<br/>
&#160;&#160;I do hope you remember me? We were together at Bellhaven Guest House in<br/>
&#160;August&#160;&#160;some years ago, and we seemed to have so much in common.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I am starting a guest house of my own on an island og the coast of Devon.<br/>
&#160;I think&#160;&#160;there is really an opening for a place where there is good plain<br/>
&#160;cooking and a&#160;&#160;nice old-fashioned type of person. None of this nudity and<br/>
&#160;gramophones half the&#160;&#160;night. I shall be very glad if you could see your way<br/>
&#160;to spending your summer&#160;&#160;holiday on Indian Island-quite free-as my guest.<br/>
&#160;Would early in August suit you?&#160;&#160;Perhaps the 81h.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Yours sincerely,<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;U. N. -<br/>
&#160;&#160;What was the name? The signature was rather difficult to read. Emily Brent<br/>
&#160;&#160;thought impatiently: &#34;So many people write their signatures quite<br/>
&#160;illegibly.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;i<br/>
&#160;~ 11<br/>
&#160;&#160;~ I<br/>

&#160;&#160;196&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She let her mind run back over the people at Bellhaven. She had been there<br/>
&#160;two&#160;&#160;summers running. There had been that nice middleaged woman-Mrs.-Mrs.-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=9></a>&#160;now what was&#160;&#160;her name?-her father had been a Canon. And there had been a<br/>
&#160;Miss Olton-Ormen- No,&#160;&#160;surely it was Oliver! Yes-Oliver.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Indian Island! There had been things in the paper about Indian Island-<br/>
&#160;something&#160;&#160;about a film star-or was it an American millionaire?<br/>
&#160;&#160;Of course often those places went very cheap-islands didn't suit everybody.<br/>
&#160;They&#160;&#160;thought the idea was romantic but when they came to live there they<br/>
&#160;realized the&#160;&#160;disadvantages and were only too glad to sell.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent thought to herself: &#34;I shall be getting a free holiday at any<br/>
&#160;rate.&#34;&#160;&#160;With her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being<br/>
&#160;paid, that was&#160;&#160;indeed something to take into consideration. If only she<br/>
&#160;could remember a little&#160;&#160;more about Mrs.-or was it MissOliver?<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur looked out of the carriage window. The train was just<br/>
&#160;coming&#160;&#160;into Exeter where he had to change. Damnable, these slow branch line<br/>
&#160;trains! This&#160;&#160;place, Indian Island, was really no distance at all as the<br/>
&#160;crow flies.&#160;&#160;He hadn't got it clear who this fellow Owen was. A friend of<br/>
&#160;Spoof Leggard's,&#160;&#160;apparently-and of Johnny Dyer's.<br/>
&#160;&#160;-One or two of your old cronies are coming-would like to have a talk over<br/>
&#160;old&#160;&#160;times.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Well, he'd enjoy a chat about old times. He'd had a fancy lately that<br/>
&#160;fellows&#160;&#160;were rather fighting shy of him. All owing to that damned rumour!<br/>
&#160;By God, it was&#160;&#160;pretty hard-nearly thirty years ago now! Armitage had<br/>
&#160;talked, he supposed. Damned&#160;&#160;young pup! What did he know about it? Oh, well,<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a>&#160;no good brooding about these&#160;&#160;things! One fancied things sometimes-fancied<br/>
&#160;a fellow was looking at you queerly.&#160;&#160;This Indian Island now, he'd be<br/>
&#160;interested to see it. A lot of gossip flying&#160;&#160;about. Looked as though there<br/>
&#160;might be something in the<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;rumour that the Admiralty or the War Office or the Air Force had got hold<br/>
&#160;of&#160;it. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Young Elmer Robson, the American millionaire, had actually built the place.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Spent thousands on it, so it was said. Every mortal luxury. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Exeter! And an hour to wait! And he didn't want to wait. He wanted to get<br/>
&#160;on.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. ..<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;6<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong was driving his Morris across Salisbury Plain. He was very<br/>
&#160;tired.&#160;&#160;. . . Success had its penalties. There had been a time when he had<br/>
&#160;sat in his&#160;&#160;consulting room in Harley Street, correctly apparelled,<br/>
&#160;surrounded with the most&#160;&#160;up-to-date appliances and the most luxurious<br/>
&#160;furnishings and waited-waited&#160;&#160;through the empty days for his venture to<br/>
&#160;succeed or fail. . . *<br/>
&#160;&#160;Well, it had succeeded! He'd been lucky! Lucky and skilful of course. He<br/>
&#160;was a&#160;&#160;good man at his job-but that wasn't enough for success. You had to<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=11></a>&#160;have luck as&#160;&#160;well. And he'd had it! An accurate diagnosis, a couple of<br/>
&#160;grateful women&#160;&#160;patients-women with money and position-and word had got<br/>
&#160;about. &#34;You ought to try&#160;&#160;Armstrong -quite a young man-but so clever- Pam<br/>
&#160;had been to all sorts of people&#160;&#160;for years and he put his finger on the<br/>
&#160;trouble at once!&#34; The ball had started&#160;&#160;rolling.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And now Dr. Armstrong had definitely arrived. His days were full. He had<br/>
&#160;little&#160;&#160;leisure. And so, on this August morning, he was glad that he was<br/>
&#160;leaving London&#160;&#160;and going to be for some days on an island off the Devon<br/>
&#160;coast. Not that it was&#160;&#160;exactly a holiday. The letter he had received had<br/>
&#160;been rather vague in its terms,&#160;&#160;but there was nothing vague about the<br/>
&#160;accompanying cheque. A whacking fee. These&#160;&#160;Owens must be rolling in money.<br/>
&#160;Some little difficulty, it seemed, a husband who&#160;&#160;was worried about his<br/>
&#160;wife's health and wanted a report on it without her being&#160;&#160;alarmed. She<br/>
&#160;wouldn't hear of seeing a doctor. Her nerves-<br/>
&#160;&#160;Nerves! The doctor's eyebrows went up. These women and their nerves! Well,<br/>
&#160;it was&#160;&#160;good for business, after all. Half the women who consulted him had<br/>
&#160;nothing the&#160;&#160;matter with them but boredom, but they wouldn't thank you for<br/>
&#160;telling them so!&#160;&#160;And one could usually find something.<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A slightly uncommon condition of the-some long word-nothing at all<br/>
&#160;serious-but&#160;&#160;it just needs putting right. A simple treatment.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Well, medicine was mostly faith-healing when it came to it. And he had a<br/>
&#160;good&#160;&#160;manner-he could inspire hope and belief.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lucky that he'd managed to pull himself together in time after that<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a>&#160;business&#160;&#160;ten-no, fifteen years ago. It had been a near thing, that! He'd<br/>
&#160;been going to&#160;&#160;pieces. The shock had pulled him together. He'd cut out drink<br/>
&#160;altogether. By&#160;&#160;Jove, it had been a near thing though. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;With a devastating ear-splitting blast on the hom an enormous Super Sports<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dalmain car rushed past him at eighty miles an hour. Dr. Armstrong nearly<br/>
&#160;went&#160;&#160;into the hedge. One of these young fools who tore round the country.<br/>
&#160;He hated&#160;&#160;them. That had been a near shave, too. Damned young fool!<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;7<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Tony Marston, roaring down into Mere, thought to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The amount of cars crawling about the roads is frightful. Always something<br/>
&#160;&#160;blocking your way. And they will drive in the middle of the road! Pretty<br/>
&#160;hopeless&#160;&#160;driving in England, anyway. . . . Not like France where you really<br/>
&#160;could let out.&#160;&#160;. . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Should he stop here for a drink, or push on? Heaps of time! Only another<br/>
&#160;hundred&#160;&#160;miles and a bit to go. He'd have a gin and gingerbeer. Fizzing hot<br/>
&#160;day!&#160;&#160;This island place ought to be rather good fun-if the weather lasted.<br/>
&#160;Who were&#160;&#160;these Owens, he wondered? Rich and stinking, probably. Badger was<br/>
&#160;rather good at&#160;&#160;nosing people like that out. Of course, he had to, poor old<br/>
&#160;chap, with no money&#160;&#160;of his own. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Hope they'd do one well in drinks. Never knew with these fellows who'd made<br/>
&#160;their&#160;&#160;money and weren't born to it. Pity that story about Gabrielle Turl<br/>
&#160;having bought&#160;&#160;Indian Island wasn't true. He'd like to have been in with<br/>
&#160;that film star crowd.&#160;&#160;Oh, well, he supposed there'd be a few girls there.<br/>
&#160;. . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a>&#160;&#160;Coming out of the Hotel, he stretched himself, yawned, looked up at the<br/>
&#160;blue sky&#160;&#160;and climbed into the Dalmain.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Several young women looked at him admiringly-his six feet of well-<br/>
&#160;proportioned&#160;&#160;body, his crisp hair, tanned face, and intensely blue eyes.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He let in the clutch with a roar and leapt up the narrow street. Old men<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;errand boys jumped for safety. The latter looked after the car<br/>
&#160;admiringly.&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston proceeded on his triumphal progress.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;8<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Blore was in the slow train from Plymouth. There was only one other<br/>
&#160;person&#160;&#160;in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye.<br/>
&#160;At the present&#160;&#160;moment he had dropped off to sleep.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Blore was writing carefully in a little notebook.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's the lot,&#34; he muttered to himself. &#34;Emily Brent, Vera Claythorne,<br/>
&#160;Dr.&#160;&#160;Armstrong, Anthony Marston, old Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard,<br/>
&#160;General&#160;&#160;Macarthur, C.M.G., D.S.O. Manservant and wife: Mr. and Mrs.<br/>
&#160;Rogers.&#34;&#160;&#160;He closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. He glanced<br/>
&#160;over at the&#160;&#160;comer and the slumbering man.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Had one over the eight,&#34; diagnosed Mr. Blore accurately.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He went over things carefully and conscientiously in his mind.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Job ought to be easy enough,&#34; he ruminated. &#34;Don't see how I can slip up<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=14></a>&#160;on it.&#160;&#160;Hope I look all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass. The face<br/>
&#160;reflected&#160;&#160;there was of a slightly military cast with a moustache. There was<br/>
&#160;very little&#160;&#160;expression in it. The eyes were grey and set rather close<br/>
&#160;together.&#160;&#160;&#34;Might be a Major,&#34; said Mr. Blore. &#34;No, I forgot. There's that<br/>
&#160;old military&#160;&#160;gent. He'd spot me at once.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;South Africa,&#34; said Mr. Blore, &#34;that's my line! None of these people have<br/>
&#160;&#160;anything to do with South Africa, and I've just been reading that travel<br/>
&#160;folder&#160;&#160;so I can talk about it all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Fortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials. As a man of means<br/>
&#160;from&#160;&#160;South Africa, Mr. Blore felt that he could enter into any society<br/>
&#160;unchallenged.&#160;&#160;Indian Island. He remembered Indian Island as a boy.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Smelly sort of rock covered with gulls-stood about a mile from the coast.<br/>
&#160;It had&#160;got its name from its resemblance to a man's head-an American Indian<br/>
&#160;profile.&#160;&#160;Funny idea to go and build a house on it! Awful in bad weather!<br/>
&#160;But millionaires&#160;&#160;were full of wbims!<br/>
&#160;&#160;200&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The old man in the comer woke up and said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You can't never tell at sea-never!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Blore said soothingly, &#34;That's right. You can't.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The old man hiccuped twice and said plaintively:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's a squall coming.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, no, mate, it's a lovely day.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The old man said angrily:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=15></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;There's a squall ahead. I can smell it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Maybe you're right,&#34; said Mr. Blore pacifically.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The train stopped at a station and the old fellow rose unsteadily.&#160;&#160;&#34;Thish<br/>
&#160;where I get out.&#34; He fumbled with the window. Mr. Blore helped him.&#160;&#160;The old<br/>
&#160;man stood in the doorway. He raised a solemn hand and blinked his bleary&#160;<br/>
&#160;eyes.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Watch and pray,&#34; he said. &#34;Watch and pray. The day of judgment is at<br/>
&#160;hand.&#34;&#160;&#160;He collapsed through the doorway onto the platform. From a recumbent<br/>
&#160;position he&#160;&#160;looked up at Mr. Blore and said with immense dignity:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm talking to you, young man. The day of judgment is very close at hand.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Subsiding onto his seat Mr. Blore thought to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He's nearer the day of judgment than I am!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But there, as it happens, he was wrong. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;OUTSIDE OAKBRIDGE STATION a little group of people stood in momentary<br/>
&#160;uncertainty.&#160;Behind them stood porters with suitcases. One of these called<br/>
&#160;&#34;Jim!&#34;&#160;&#160;The driver of one of the taxis stepped forward.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'm for Indian Island, maybe?&#34; he asked in a soft Devon voice. Four<br/>
&#160;voices&#160;&#160;gave assent-and then immediately afterwards gave quick surreptitious<br/>
&#160;glances at&#160;&#160;each other.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The driver said, addressing his remarks to Mr. Justice Wargrave as the<br/>
&#160;senior&#160;&#160;member of the party:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There are two taxis here, sir. One of them must wait till the slow<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;train from Exeter gets in-a matter of five minutes-there's one gentleman<br/>
&#160;coming&#160;by that. Perhaps one of you wouldn't mind waiting? You'd be more<br/>
&#160;comfortable that&#160;way.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythome, her own secretarial position clear in her mind, spoke at<br/>
&#160;once.&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll wait,&#34; she said, &#34;if you will go on?&#34; She looked at the other<br/>
&#160;three, her&#160;&#160;glance and voice had that slight suggestion of command mi<br/>
&#160;&#160;it that comes from having occupied a position of authority. She might have<br/>
&#160;been&#160;directing which tennis sets the girls were to play in.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent said stiffly, &#34;Thank you,&#34; bent her head and entered one of the<br/>
&#160;taxis,&#160;&#160;the door of which the driver was holding open.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave followed her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Captain Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll wait with Miss-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Claythome,&#34; said Vera.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My name is Lombard, Philip Lombard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The porters were piling luggage on the taxi. Inside, Mr. Justice Wargrave<br/>
&#160;said&#160;&#160;with due legal caution:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Beautiful weather we are having.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, indeed.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A very distinguished old gentleman, she thought to herself. Quite unlike<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;usual type of man in seaside guest houses. Evidently Mrs. or Miss<br/>
&#160;Oliver had good&#160;&#160;connections. . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave inquired:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do you know this part of the world well?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I have been to Cornwall and to Torquay, but this is my first visit to this<br/>
&#160;part&#160;&#160;of Devon.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I also am unacquainted with this part of the world.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The taxi drove off.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The driver of the second taxi said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Like to sit inside while you're waiting?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said decisively:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not at all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Captain Lombard smiled.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That sunny wall looks more attractive. Unless you'd rather go inside the<br/>
&#160;&#160;station?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, indeed. It's so delightful to get out of that stuffy train.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He answered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;202&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, travelling by train is rather trying in this weather.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said conventionally:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I do hope it lasts-the weather, I mean. Our English summers are so<br/>
&#160;treacherous.&#34;&#160;With a slight lack of originality Lombard asked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do you know this part of the world well?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, I've never been here before.&#34; She added quickly, conscientiously<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a>&#160;determined&#160;&#160;to make her position clear at once, &#34;I haven't even seen my<br/>
&#160;employer yet.&#34;&#160;&#34;Your employer?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I'm Mrs. Owen's secretary.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, I see.&#34; Just imperceptibly his manner changed. It was slightly more<br/>
&#160;&#160;assured-easier in tone. He said: &#34;Isn't that rather unusual?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera laughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, no, I don't think so. Her own secretary was suddenly taken ill and she<br/>
&#160;wired&#160;&#160;to an agency for a substitute and they sent me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So that was it. And suppose you don't like the post when you've got<br/>
&#160;there?&#34;&#160;Vera laughed again.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, it's only temporary-a holiday post. I've got a permanent job at a<br/>
&#160;girls'&#160;&#160;school. As a matter of fact I'm frightfully thrilled at the prospect<br/>
&#160;of seeing&#160;&#160;Indian Island. There's been such a lot about it in the papers.<br/>
&#160;Is it really very&#160;&#160;fascinating?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know. I haven't seen it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, really? The Owens are frightfully keen on it, I suppose. What are they<br/>
&#160;like?&#160;&#160;Do tell me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard thought: Awkward, this-am I supposed to have met them or not? He<br/>
&#160;said&#160;&#160;quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's a wasp crawling up your arm. No-keep quite still.&#34; He made a<br/>
&#160;convincing&#160;&#160;pounce. &#34;There. It's gone!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, thank you. There are a lot of wasps about this summer.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I suppose it's the heat. Who are we waiting for, do you know?&#34;&#160;&#34;I<br/>
&#160;haven't the least idea.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The loud drawn out scream of an approaching train was heard. Lombard said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=19></a>&#160;&#34;That will be the train now.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was a tall soldierly old man who appeared at the eidt from the platform.<br/>
&#160;His&#160;&#160;grey hair was clipped close and he had a neatly trimmed white<br/>
&#160;moustache.&#160;&#160;His porter, staggering slightly under the weight of the solid<br/>
&#160;leather suitcase,&#160;&#160;indicated Vera and Lombard.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera came forward in a competent manner. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I am Mrs. Owen's secretary. There is a car here waiting.&#34; She added: &#34;This<br/>
&#160;is&#160;&#160;Mr. Lombard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The faded blue eyes, shrewd in spite of their age, sized up Lombard. For<br/>
&#160;a moment&#160;&#160;a judgment showed in them-had there been any one to read it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Good-looking fellow. Something just a little wrong about him. . . .')&#160;<br/>
&#160;The three of them got into the waiting taxi. They drove through the sleepy<br/>
&#160;&#160;streets of little Oakbridge and continued about a mile on the main Plymouth<br/>
&#160;road.&#160;&#160;Then they plunged into a maze of cross country lanes, steep, green<br/>
&#160;and narrow.&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't know this part of Devon at all. My little place is in East Devon-<br/>
&#160;just on&#160;&#160;the border-line of Dorset.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It really is lovely here. The hills and the red earth and everything so<br/>
&#160;green&#160;&#160;and luscious looking.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a>&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said critically:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's a bit shut in. . . . I like open country myself. Where you can see<br/>
&#160;what's&#160;&#160;coming. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said to him:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You've seen a bit of the world, I fancy?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard shrugged his shoulders disparagingly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've knocked about here and there, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought to himself: &#34;He'll ask me now if I was old enough to be in the<br/>
&#160;War.&#160;&#160;These old boys always do.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But General Macarthur did not mention the War.<br/>
&#160;&#160;204&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They came up over a steep hill and down a zig-zag, track to Sticklehaven-a<br/>
&#160;mere&#160;&#160;cluster of cottages with a fishing boat or two drawn up on the beach.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Illuminated by the setting sun, they had their first glimpse of Indian<br/>
&#160;Island&#160;&#160;jutting up out of the sea to the south.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said, surprised:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's a long way out.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She had pictured it differently, close to shore, crowned with a beautiful<br/>
&#160;white&#160;&#160;house. But there was no house visible, only the boldly silhouetted<br/>
&#160;rock with its&#160;&#160;faint resemblance to a giant Indian's head. There was<br/>
&#160;something sinister about&#160;&#160;it. She shivered faintly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Outside a little inn, the Seven Stars, three people were sitting. There was<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;hunched elderly figure of the judge, the upright form of Miss Brent,<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=21></a>&#160;and a third&#160;&#160;man-a big bluff man who came forward and introduced himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Thought we might as well wait for you,&#34; he said. &#34;Make one trip of it.<br/>
&#160;Allow me&#160;&#160;to introduce myself. Name's Davis. Natal, South Africa's, my natal<br/>
&#160;spot, ha, ha!&#34;&#160;He laughed breezily.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave looked at him with active malevolence. He seemed to<br/>
&#160;be&#160;&#160;wishing that he could order the court to be cleared. Miss Emily Brent<br/>
&#160;was clearly&#160;&#160;not sure if she liked Colonials.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Any one care for a little nip before we embark?&#34; asked Mr. Davis<br/>
&#160;hospitably.&#160;&#160;Nobody assenting to this proposition, Mr. Davis turned and held<br/>
&#160;up a finger.&#160;&#160;&#34;Mustn't delay, then. Our good host and hostess will be<br/>
&#160;expecting us,&#34; he said.&#160;&#160;He might have noticed that a curious constraint<br/>
&#160;came over the other members of&#160;&#160;the party. It was as though the mention of<br/>
&#160;their host and hostess had a curiously&#160;&#160;paralyzing effect upon the guests.<br/>
&#160;&#160;In response to Davis' beckoning finger, a man detached himself from a<br/>
&#160;nearby wall&#160;&#160;against which he was leaning and came up to them. His rolling<br/>
&#160;gait proclaimed&#160;&#160;hirn a man of the sea. He had a weather-beaten face and<br/>
&#160;dark eyes with a slightly&#160;&#160;evasive expression. He spoke in his soft Devon<br/>
&#160;voice.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Will you be ready to be starting for the island, ladies and gentlemen? The<br/>
&#160;&#160;boat's waiting. There's two gentlemen coming by car, but Mr. Owen's orders<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=22></a>&#160;was&#160;&#160;not to wait for them as they might arrive at any time.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The party got up. Their guide led them along a small stone jetty. Alongside<br/>
&#160;it&#160;&#160;a motor boat was lying.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's a very small boat.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The boat's owner said persuasively:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She's a fine boat, that, Ma'am. You could go to Plymouth in her as easy<br/>
&#160;as&#160;&#160;winking.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There are a good many of us.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She'd take double the number, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said in his pleasant easy voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's quite all right. Glorious weather-no swell.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rather doubtfully, Miss Brent permitted herself to be helped into the boat.<br/>
&#160;The&#160;&#160;others followed suit. There was as yet no fraternizing among the party.<br/>
&#160;It was&#160;&#160;as though each member of it was puzzled by the other members.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They were just about to cast loose when their guide paused, boathook in<br/>
&#160;hand.&#160;&#160;Down the steep track into the village a car was coming. A car so<br/>
&#160;fantastically&#160;&#160;powerful, so superlatively beautiful that it had all the<br/>
&#160;nature of an apparition.&#160;&#160;At the wheel sat a young man, his hair blown back<br/>
&#160;by the wind. In the blaze of&#160;&#160;the evening light he looked, not a man, but<br/>
&#160;a young God, a Hero God out of some&#160;&#160;Northern Saga.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He touched the hom and a great roar of sound echoed from the rocks of the<br/>
&#160;bay.&#160;&#160;It was a fantastic moment. In it, Anthony Marston seemed to be<br/>
&#160;something more&#160;&#160;than mortal. Afterwards, more than one of those present<br/>
&#160;remembered that moment.<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Fred Narracott sat by the engine thinking to himself that this was a queer<br/>
&#160;&#160;lot. Not at all his idea of what Mr. Owen's guests were likely to be. He'd<br/>
&#160;&#160;expected something altogether more classy. Togged up<br/>
&#160;&#160;206&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;women and gentlemen in yachting costume and all very rich and important<br/>
&#160;looking.&#160;&#160;Not at all like Mr. Elmer Robson's parties. A faint grin came to<br/>
&#160;Fred Narracott's&#160;&#160;lips as he remembered the millionaire's guests. That had<br/>
&#160;been a party if you&#160;&#160;like-and the drink they'd got through!<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;This Mr. Owen must be a very different sort of gentleman. Funny it was,<br/>
&#160;thought&#160;&#160;Fred, that he'd never yet set eyes on Owen-,or his Missus either.<br/>
&#160;Never been down&#160;&#160;here yet, he hadn't. Everything ordered and paid for by<br/>
&#160;that Mr. Morris.&#160;&#160;Instructions always very clear and payment prompt, but it<br/>
&#160;was odd, all the same.&#160;&#160;The papers said there was some mystery about Owen.<br/>
&#160;Mr. Narracott agreed with&#160;&#160;them.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Perhaps, after all, it was Miss Gabrielle Turl who had bought the island.<br/>
&#160;But&#160;&#160;that theory departed from him as he surveyed his passengers. Not this<br/>
&#160;lot-none&#160;&#160;of them looked likely to have anything to do with a film star.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He summed them up dispassionately.<br/>
&#160;&#160;One old maid-the sour kind-he knew them well enough. She was a Tartar, he<br/>
&#160;could&#160;&#160;bet. Old military gentleman-real Army by the look of him. Nice<br/>
&#160;looking young&#160;&#160;lady-but the ordinary kind, not glamourous-no Hollywood touch<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a>&#160;about her. That&#160;&#160;bluff cheery genthe wasn't a real gentleman. Retired<br/>
&#160;tradesman, that's what he&#160;&#160;is, thought Fred Narracott. The other gentleman,<br/>
&#160;the lean hungry looking&#160;&#160;gentleman with the quick eyes, he was a queer one,<br/>
&#160;he was. Just possible he might&#160;&#160;have something to do with the pictures.<br/>
&#160;&#160;No, there was only one satisfactory passenger in the boat. The last<br/>
&#160;gentleman,&#160;&#160;the one who had arrived in the car (and what a car! A car such<br/>
&#160;as had never been&#160;&#160;seen in Sticklehaven before. Must have cost hundreds and<br/>
&#160;hundreds, a car like&#160;&#160;that.). He was the right kind. Born to money, he was.<br/>
&#160;If the party had been all&#160;&#160;like him . he'd understand it. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Queer business when you came to think of it-the whole thing was queer-very<br/>
&#160;queer.&#160;&#160;.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The boat churned its way round the rock. Now at last the house<br/>
&#160;&#160;came into view. The south side of the island was quite different. It shelved<br/>
&#160;gently down to the sea. The house was there facing south-<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;207 low and square and modem-looking<br/>
&#160;with&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;rounded windows letting in all<br/>
&#160;the light.&#160;An exciting house-a house that lived up to expectation!<br/>
&#160;&#160;Fred Narracott shut off the engine, they nosed their way gently into a<br/>
&#160;little&#160;&#160;natural inlet between rocks.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Must be difficult to land here in dirty weather.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=25></a>&#160;&#160;Fred Narracott said cheerfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Can't land on Indian Island when there's a southeasterly. Sometimes 'tis<br/>
&#160;cut off&#160;&#160;for a week or more.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythome thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The catering must be very difficult. That's the worst of an island. All<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;domestic problems are so worrying.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The boat grated against the rocks. Fred Narracott jumped out and he and<br/>
&#160;Lombard&#160;&#160;helped the others to alight. Narracott made the boat fast to a ring<br/>
&#160;in the rock.&#160;&#160;Then he led the way up steps cut in the rock.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ha, delightful spot!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But he felt uneasy. Damned odd sort of place.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;As the party ascended the steps, and came out on a terrace above, their<br/>
&#160;spirits&#160;&#160;revived. In the open doorway of the house a correct butler was<br/>
&#160;awaiting them, and&#160;&#160;something about his gravity reassured them. And then the<br/>
&#160;house itself was really&#160;&#160;most attractive, the view from the terrace<br/>
&#160;magnificent. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;The butler came forward bowing slightly. He was a tall lank man, grey-<br/>
&#160;haired and&#160;&#160;very respectable. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Will you come this way, please?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the wide hall drinks stood ready. Rows of bottles. Anthony Marston's<br/>
&#160;spirits&#160;&#160;cheered up a little. He'd just been thinking this was a rum kind<br/>
&#160;of show. None&#160;&#160;of his lot! What could old Badger have been thinking about<br/>
&#160;to let him in for&#160;&#160;this? However the drinks were all right. Plenty of ice,<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=26></a>&#160;too.<br/>
&#160;&#160;What was it the butler chap was saying?<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Owen-unfortunately delayed-unable to get here till to-morrow.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Instructions-everything they wanted-if they would like to go to their<br/>
&#160;rooms? .&#160;&#160;. . Dinner would be at 8 o'clock. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;208&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;6<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE&#160;&#160;209<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera had followed Mrs. Rogers upstairs. The woman had thrown open a door<br/>
&#160;at the&#160;&#160;end of a passage and Vera had walked into a delightful bedroom with<br/>
&#160;a big window&#160;&#160;that opened wide upon the sea and another looking east. She<br/>
&#160;uttered a quick&#160;&#160;exclarnation of pleasure.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mrs. Rogers was saying:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I hope you've got everything you want, Miss?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera looked round. Her luggage had been brought up and had been unpacked.<br/>
&#160;At one&#160;&#160;side of the room a door stood open into a pale blue tiled bathroom.<br/>
&#160;She said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, everything, I think.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'll ring the bell if you want anything, Miss?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mrs. Rogers had a flat monotonous voice. Vera looked at her curiously. What<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;white bloodless ghost of a woman! Very respectable looking, with her hair<br/>
&#160;dragged&#160;&#160;back from her face and her black dress. Queer light eyes that<br/>
&#160;shifted the whole&#160;&#160;time from place to place.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=27></a>&#160;&#160;Vera thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She looks frightened of her own shadow.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Yes, that was it-frightened!<br/>
&#160;&#160;She looked like a woman who walked in mortal fear. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;A little shiver passed down Vera's back. What on earth was the woman afraid<br/>
&#160;of?&#160;She said pleasantly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm Mrs. Owen's new secretary. I expect you know that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mrs. Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, Miss, I don't know anything. Just a list of the ladies and gentlemen<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;what rooms they were to have.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Mrs. Owen didn't mention me?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mrs. Rogers' eyelashes flickered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I haven't seen Mrs. Owen-not yet. We only came here two days ago.))<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Extraordinary people, these Owens, thought Vera. Aloud she said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What staff is there here?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=28></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Just me and Rogers, Miss.&#34;the host and<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera frowned. Eight people in the house-ten with<br/>
&#160;&#160;hostess-and only one married couple to do for them.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mrs. Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm a good cook and Rogers is handy about the house. I didn't know, of<br/>
&#160;course,&#160;&#160;that there was to be such a large party.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But you can manage?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, yes, Miss, I can manage. If there's to be large parties often, perhaps<br/>
&#160;Mrs.&#160;&#160;Owen could get extra help in.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said, &#34;I expect so.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mrs. Rogers turned to go. Her feet moved noiselessly over the floor. She<br/>
&#160;drifted&#160;&#160;from the room like a shadow.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera went over to the window and sat down on the window seat. She was<br/>
&#160;faintly&#160;&#160;disturbed. Everything-somehow-was a little queer. The absence of<br/>
&#160;the Owens, the&#160;&#160;pale ghostlike Mrs. Rogers. And the guests! Yes, the guests<br/>
&#160;were queer too. An&#160;&#160;oddly assorted party.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I wish I'd seen the Owens. . . . I wish I knew what they were like.&#34;&#160;She<br/>
&#160;got up andwalked restlessly about the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;A perfect bedroom decorated throughout in the modem style. Off white rugs<br/>
&#160;on the&#160;&#160;gleaming parquet floor-faintly tinted walls-a long mirror surrounded<br/>
&#160;by lights.&#160;&#160;A mantelpiece bare of ornaments save for an enormous block of<br/>
&#160;white marble shaped&#160;&#160;like a bear, a piece of modem sculpture in which was<br/>
&#160;inset a clock. Over it, in&#160;&#160;a gleaming chromium frame, was a big square of<br/>
&#160;parchment-a poem.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=29></a>&#160;&#160;She stood in front of the fireplace and read it. It was the old nursery<br/>
&#160;rhyme&#160;&#160;that she remembered from her childhood days.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then<br/>
&#160;there were nine.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then<br/>
&#160;there&#160;were eight.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Eight little Indian boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and<br/>
&#160;then&#160;there were seven.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves<br/>
&#160;and&#160;then there were six.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then<br/>
&#160;there were five.<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Five little Indian boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there<br/>
&#160;were four.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and<br/>
&#160;then&#160;there were three.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=30></a>&#160;&#160;Three little Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged one and then<br/>
&#160;there were two.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then<br/>
&#160;there&#160;was one.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;One little Indian boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then<br/>
&#160;there&#160;were none.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera smiled. Of course! This was Indian Island!<br/>
&#160;&#160;She went and sat again by the window looking out to sea.<br/>
&#160;&#160;How big the sea was! From here there was no land to be seen anywhere-just<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;vast expanse of blue water rippling in the evening sun.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The sea. . . . So peaceful to-day-sometimes so cruel . . . . The sea that<br/>
&#160;&#160;dragged you down to its depths. Drowned . . . . Found drowned. . . .<br/>
&#160;drowned.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Drowned at sea. . . . Drowned-drowned-<br/>
&#160;&#160;No, she wouldn't remember. . . . She would not think of it! All that was<br/>
&#160;over.&#160;. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;7<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong came to Indian Island just as the sun was sinking into the<br/>
&#160;sea. On&#160;&#160;the way across he had chatted to the boatman-a local man. He was<br/>
&#160;anxious to find&#160;&#160;out a little about these people who owned Indian Island,<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a>&#160;but the man Narracott&#160;&#160;seemed curiously ill M*formed, or perhaps unwilling<br/>
&#160;to talk.<br/>
&#160;&#160;So Dr. Armstrong chatted instead of the weather and of fishing.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He was tired after his long motor drive. His eyeballs ached. Driving west<br/>
&#160;you&#160;&#160;were driving against the sun.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Yes, he was very tired. The sea and perfect peace-that was what he needed.<br/>
&#160;He&#160;&#160;would like, really, to take a long holiday. But he couldn't afford to<br/>
&#160;do that.&#160;&#160;He could afford it financially, of course, but he couldn't afford<br/>
&#160;to drop out.&#160;&#160;You were soon forgotten nowadays. No, now that he had arrived,<br/>
&#160;he must keep his&#160;&#160;nose to the grindstone.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;211<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;All the same, this evening, I'll imagine to myself that I'm not going<br/>
&#160;back-that&#160;&#160;I've done with London and Harley Street and all the rest of it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was something magical about an island-the mere word suggested<br/>
&#160;fantasy. You&#160;&#160;lost touch with the world-an island was a world of its own.<br/>
&#160;A world, perhaps,&#160;&#160;from which you might never return.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm leaving my ordinary life behind me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And, smiling to himself, he began to make plans, fantastic plans for the<br/>
&#160;future.&#160;He was still smiling when he walked up the rock cut steps.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a>&#160;&#160;In a chair on the terrace an old gentleman was sitting and the sight of him<br/>
&#160;'Was&#160;&#160;vaguely familiar to Dr. Armstrong. Where had he seen that frog-like<br/>
&#160;face, that&#160;&#160;tortoise-like neck, that hunched up attitudeyes, and those pale<br/>
&#160;shrewd little&#160;&#160;eyes? Of course-old Wargrave. He'd given evidence once before<br/>
&#160;him. Always looked&#160;&#160;half asleep, but was shrewd as could be when it came to<br/>
&#160;a point of law. Had great&#160;&#160;power with a jury-it was said he could make their<br/>
&#160;minds up for them any day of&#160;&#160;the week. He'd got one or two unlikely<br/>
&#160;convictions out of them. A hanging judge,&#160;&#160;some people said.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Funny place to meet him . . . here-out of the world.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;8<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave thought to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Armstrong? Remember him in the witness box. Very correct and cautious. All<br/>
&#160;&#160;doctors are damned fools. Harley Street ones are the worst of the lot.&#34; And<br/>
&#160;&#160;his mind dwelt malevolently on a recent interview he had had with a suave<br/>
&#160;&#160;personage in that very street.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Aloud he grunted:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Drinks are in the hall.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I must go and pay my respects to my host and hostess.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave closed his eyes again, looking decidedly reptilian,<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You can't do that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;212&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=33></a>&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong was startled.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why not?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No host and hostess. Very curious state of affairs. Don't understand this<br/>
&#160;&#160;place.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong stared at him for a minute. When he thought the old gentleman<br/>
&#160;had&#160;&#160;actually gone to sleep, Wargrave said suddenly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;D'you know Constance Culmington?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Er-no, I'm afraid I don't.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's of no consequence,&#34; said the judge. &#34;Very vague woman-and practically<br/>
&#160;&#160;unreadable handwriting. I was just wondering if I'd come to the wrong<br/>
&#160;house.&#34;&#160;Dr. Armstrong shook his head and went on up to the house.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave reflected on the subject of Constance Culmington.&#160;<br/>
&#160;Undependable like all women.<br/>
&#160;&#160;His mind went on to the two women in the house, the tight-lipped old maid<br/>
&#160;and the&#160;&#160;girl. He didn't care for the girl, cold-blooded young hussy. No,<br/>
&#160;three women, if&#160;&#160;you counted the Rogers woman. Odd creature, she looked<br/>
&#160;scared to death.&#160;&#160;Respectable pair and knew their job.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers coming out on the terrace that minute, the judge asked him:&#160;&#34;Is<br/>
&#160;Lady Constance Culmington expected, do you know?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers stared at him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, Sir, not to my knowledge.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge's eyebrows rose. But he only grunted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Indian Island, eh? There's a nigger in the woodpile.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>

&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston was in his bath. He luxuriated in the steaming water. His<br/>
&#160;&#160;limbs had felt cramped after his long drive. Very few thoughts passed<br/>
&#160;through&#160;&#160;his head. Anthony was a creature of sensation-and of action.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Must go through with it, I suppose,&#34; and thereafter dismissed everything<br/>
&#160;from&#160;&#160;his mind.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;1.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I 1<br/>
&#160;&#160;1<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;213<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Warm steaming water-tired limbs-presently a shave-a cocktaildinner.&#160;And<br/>
&#160;after-?<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;10<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Blore was tying his tie. He wasn't very good at this sort of thing.<br/>
&#160;Did he look all right? He supposed so.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Nobody had been exactly cordial to him. all eyed each other-as though they<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=35></a>&#160;&#160;knew.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Well, it was up to him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He didn't mean to bungle his job.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He glanced up at the framed nursery rhyme over the mantelpiece.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Neat touch, having that there!<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;Remember this island when I was a kid. Never thought I'd be doing this sort<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;a job in a house here. Good thing, perhaps, that one can't foresee the<br/>
&#160;future<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. . Funny the way they<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;11<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur was frowning to himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Damn it all, the whole thing was deuced odd! Not at all what he'd been led<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;expect. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;For two pins he'd make an excuse and get away. the whole business. . . .<br/>
&#160;But the motor boat had gone back to the mainland.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd have to stay.<br/>
&#160;&#160;That fellow Lombard now, he was a queer chap.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Not straight. He'd swear the man wasn't straight.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;12<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=36></a>&#160;&#160;. . Throw up<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;As the gong sounded, Philip Lombard came out of his room and walked to the<br/>
&#160;&#160;head of the stairs. He moved like a panther, smoothly<br/>
&#160;&#160;214<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;and noiselessly. There was something of the panther about him altogether.<br/>
&#160;A&#160;beast of prey-pleasant to the eye. He was smiling to himself . A week-eh?<br/>
&#160;He&#160;was going to enjoy that week.<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;In her bedroom, Emily Brent, dressed in black silk ready for dinner, was<br/>
&#160;&#160;reading her Bible.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her lips moved as she followed the words:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they<br/>
&#160;&#160;hid is their own foot taken. The Lord is known by the judgment which he&#160;<br/>
&#160;executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. The wicked<br/>
&#160;shall&#160;&#160;be turned into hell.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her tight lips closed. She shut the Bible.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rising, she pinned a cairngorm brooch at her neck, and went down to dinner.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=37></a>&#160;&#160;DINNER WAS drawing to a close.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The food had been good, the wine perfect. Rogers waited well.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Every one was in better spirits. They had begun to talk to each other with<br/>
&#160;more&#160;&#160;freedom and intimacy.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave, mellowed by the excellent port, was being amusing in<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;caustic fashion, Dr. Armstrong and Tony Marston were listening to him.<br/>
&#160;Miss Brent&#160;&#160;chatted to General Macarthur, they had discovered some mutual<br/>
&#160;friends. Vera&#160;&#160;Claythorne was asking Mr. Davis intelligent questions about<br/>
&#160;South Africa. Mr.&#160;&#160;Davis was quite fluent on the subject. Lombard listened<br/>
&#160;to the conversation. Once&#160;&#160;or twice he looked up quickly, and his eyes<br/>
&#160;narrowed. Now and then his eyes&#160;&#160;played round the table, studying the<br/>
&#160;others.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston said suddenly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Quaint, these things, aren't they?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;215<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the centre of the round table, on a circular glass stand, were some<br/>
&#160;little&#160;&#160;china figures.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Indians,&#34; said Tony. &#34;Indian Island. I suppose that's the idea.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera leaned forward.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I wonder. How many are there? Ten?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes-ten there are.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=38></a>&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What fun! They're the ten little Indian boys of the nursery rhyme, I<br/>
&#160;suppose.&#160;&#160;In my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the<br/>
&#160;mantelpiece.&#34;&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In my room, too.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And mine.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And mine.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Everybody joined the chorus. Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's an amusing idea, isn't it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave grunted:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Remarkably childish,&#34; and helped himself to port.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent looked at Vera Claythorne. Vera Claythorne looked at Miss<br/>
&#160;Brent.&#160;&#160;The two women rose.<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the drawing-room, the French windows were open onto the terrace and the<br/>
&#160;&#160;sound of the sea murmuring against the rocks came up to them.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said: &#34;Pleasant sound.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said sharply: &#34;I hate it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent's eyes looked at her in surprise. Vera flushed. She said, more<br/>
&#160;&#160;composedly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't think this place would be very agreeable in a storm.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent agreed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've no doubt the house is shut up in winter,&#34; she said. &#34;You'd never get<br/>
&#160;&#160;servants to stay here for one thing.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It must be difficult to get servants anyway.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=39></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Mrs. Oliver has been lucky to get these two. The woman's a good cook.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Vera thou(yht:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Funny how elderly people always get names wrong.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I think Mrs. Owen has been very lucky indeed.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent had brought a small piece of embroidery out of her<br/>
&#160;&#160;216&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;bag. Now, as she was about to thread her needle, she paused. She said<br/>
&#160;sharply:&#160;&#34;Owen? Did you say Owen?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've never met any one called Owen in my life.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera stared.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But surely-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She did not finish her sentence. The door opened and the men joined them.<br/>
&#160;Rogers&#160;&#160;followed them into the room with the coffee tray.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge came and sat down by Emily Brent. Armstrong came up to Vera. Tony<br/>
&#160;&#160;Marston strolled to the open window. Blore studied with na*fve surprise a<br/>
&#160;&#160;statuette in brass-wondering perhaps if its bizarre angularities were really<br/>
&#160;&#160;supposed to be the female figure. General Macarthur stood with his back to<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;mantelpiece. He pulled at his little white moustache. That had been a<br/>
&#160;damned good&#160;&#160;dinner! His spirits were rising. Lombard turned over the pages<br/>
&#160;of Punch that lay&#160;&#160;with other papers on a table by the wall.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers went round with the coffee tray. The coffee was goodreally black and<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=40></a>&#160;very&#160;&#160;hot.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The whole party had dined well. They were satisfied with themselves and<br/>
&#160;with&#160;&#160;life. The hands of the clock pointed to twenty minutes past nine.<br/>
&#160;There was a&#160;&#160;silence-a comfortable replete silence.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Into that silence came The Voice. Without warning, inhuman, penetrating .<br/>
&#160;. .&#160;&#34;Ladies and gentlemen! Silence, please I&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Every one was startled. They looked round-at each other, at the walls. Who<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;speaking?<br/>
&#160;&#160;The Voice went on-a high clear voice.<br/>
&#160;&#160;You are charged with the following indictments:<br/>
&#160;&#160;Edward George Armstrong, that you did upon the 14th day of March, 1925,<br/>
&#160;cause the&#160;&#160;death of Louisa Mary Clees.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Caroline Brent, that upon the 5th November, 1931, you were<br/>
&#160;responsible for&#160;&#160;the death of Beatrice Taylor.<br/>
&#160;&#160;William Henry Blore, that you brought about the death of James Stephen<br/>
&#160;Landor on&#160;&#160;October 10th, 1928.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, that on the 11th day of August, 1935, you killed<br/>
&#160;Cyril&#160;&#160;Ogilvie Hamilton.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard, that upon a date in February, 1932, you were<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;217<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;guilty of the death of twenty-one men, members of an East African tribe.&#160;<br/>
&#160;John Gordon Macarthur, that on the 4th of January, 1917, you deliberately<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=41></a>&#160;sent&#160;&#160;your wife's lover, Arthur Richmond, to his death.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony James Marston, that upon the 14th day of November last, you were<br/>
&#160;&#160;guilty of the murder of John and Lucy Combes.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Thomas Rogers and Ethel Rogers, that on the 6th of May, 1929, you brought<br/>
&#160;&#160;about the death of Jennifer Brady.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lawrence John Wargrave, that upon the 10th day of June, 1930, you were<br/>
&#160;guilty&#160;&#160;of the murder of Edward Seton.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Prisoners at the bar, have you anything to say in your defence?<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The Voice had stopped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a moment's petrified silence and then a resounding crash! Rogers<br/>
&#160;had&#160;&#160;dropped the coffee tray!<br/>
&#160;&#160;At the same moment, from somewhere outside the room there came a scream and<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;sound of a thud.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard was the first to move. He leapt to the door and flung it open.<br/>
&#160;Outside,&#160;&#160;lying in a huddled mass, was Mrs. Rogers.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard called:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Marston.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony sprang to help him. Between them, they lifted up the woman and<br/>
&#160;carried&#160;&#160;her into the drawing-room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong came across quickly. He helped them to lift her onto the sofa<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;bent over her. He said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's nothing. She's fainted, that's all. She'll be round in a minute.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=42></a>&#160;Lombard said to Rogers:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Get some brandy.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers, his face white, his hands shaking, murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; and slipped quickly out of the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried out:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Who was that speaking? Where was he? It sounded-it sounded-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur spluttered out:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's going on here? What kind of a practical joke was that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His hand was shaking. His shoulders sagged. He looked suddenly ten years<br/>
&#160;older.&#160;Blore was mopping his face with a handkerchief.<br/>
&#160;&#160;218&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Only Mr. Justice Wargrave and Miss Brent seemed comparatively unmoved.<br/>
&#160;Emily&#160;&#160;Brent sat upright, her head held high. In both cheeks was a spot of<br/>
&#160;hard colour.&#160;&#160;The judge sat in his habitual pose, his head sunk down into<br/>
&#160;his neck. With one&#160;&#160;hand he gently scratched his ear. Only his eyes were<br/>
&#160;active, darting round and&#160;&#160;round the room, puzzled, alert with intelligence.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Again it was Lombard who acted. Armstrong being busy with the collapsed<br/>
&#160;woman,&#160;&#160;Lombard was free once more to take the initiative.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That voice? It sounded as though it were in the room.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Who was it? Who was it? It wasn't one of us.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Like the judge, Lombard's eyes wandered slowly round the room. They rested<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;minute on the open window, then he shook his head decisively. Suddenly<br/>
&#160;his eyes&#160;&#160;lighted up. He moved forward swiftly to where a door near the<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=43></a>&#160;fireplace led into&#160;&#160;an adjoining room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;With a swift gesture, he caught the handle and flung the door open. He<br/>
&#160;passed&#160;&#160;through and immediately uttered an exclamation of satisfaction.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;All, here we are.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The others crowded after him. Only Miss Brent remained alone sitting erect<br/>
&#160;in her&#160;&#160;chair.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inside the second room a table had been brought up close to the wall which<br/>
&#160;&#160;adjoined the drawing-room. On the table was a gramophone-an old-fashioned<br/>
&#160;type&#160;&#160;with a large trumpet attached. The mouth of the trumpet was against<br/>
&#160;the wall, and&#160;&#160;Lombard, pushing it aside, indicated where two or three small<br/>
&#160;holes had been&#160;&#160;unobtrusively bored through the wall.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Adjusting the gramophone he replaced the needle on the record and<br/>
&#160;immediately&#160;&#160;they heard again: &#34;You are charged with the following<br/>
&#160;indictments-&#34;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Turn it off! Turn it off! It's horrible!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard obeyed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said, with a sigh of relief:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A disgraceful and heartless practical joke, I suppose.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The small clear voice of Mr. Justice Wargrave murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So you think it's a joke, do you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Tile doctor stared at him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Wh&#34;t ~1- -I'l it 1-911<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=44></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;f<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;219<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The hand of the judge gently stroked his upper lip.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;At the moment I'm not prepared to give an opinion.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston broke in. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here, there's one thing you've forgotten. Who the devil turned the<br/>
&#160;thing&#160;&#160;on and set it going?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I think we must inquire into that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He led the way back into the drawing-room. The others followed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers had just come in with a glass of brandy. Miss Brent was bending over<br/>
&#160;&#160;the moaning form of Mrs. Rogers.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Adroitly Rogers slipped between the two women.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Allow me, Madam, I'll speak to her. Ethel-Ethel-it's all right. All right,<br/>
&#160;do&#160;&#160;you hear? Pull yourself together.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mrs. Rogers' breath came in quick gasps. Her eyes, staring frightened eyes,<br/>
&#160;&#160;went round and round the ring of faces. There was urgency in Rogers' tone.<br/>
&#160;&#34;Pull yourself together, Ethel.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong spoke to her soothingly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'll be all right now, Mrs. Rogers. Just a nasty turn.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Did I faint, sir?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=45></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It was The Voice-that awful voice-like a judgment-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her face turned green again, her eyelids fluttered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Where's that brandy?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers had put it down on a little table. Some one handed it to the doctor<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;he bent over the gasping woman with it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Drink this, Mrs. Rogers.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She drank, choking a little and gasping. The spirit did her good. The<br/>
&#160;colour&#160;&#160;returned to her face. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm all right now. It just-gave me a turn.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course it did. It gave me a turn too. Fair made me drop that tray.<br/>
&#160;Wicked&#160;&#160;lies, it was! I'd like to know-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He was interrupted. It was only a cough-a dry little cough but it<br/>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;el<br/>
&#160;&#160;had the effect of stopping him in full cry. He stared at Mr. Justice<br/>
&#160;Wargrave&#160;and the latter coughed again. Then lie said: &#34;Who put that record<br/>
&#160;on the&#160;gramophone? Was it you, Rogers?&#34; Rogers cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;220&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I didn't know what it was. Before God, I didn't know what it was, sir. If<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;had I'd never have done it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said drily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That is probably true. But I think you'd better explain, Rogers.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=46></a>&#160;&#160;The butler wiped his face with a handkerchief. He said earnestly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was just obeying orders, Sir, that's all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Whose orders?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Mr. Owen's.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Let me get this quite clear. Mr. Owen's orders were-what exactly?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was to put a record on the gramophone. I'd find the record mi the drawer<br/>
&#160;&#160;and my wife was to start the gramophone when I'd gone into the drawing-room<br/>
&#160;&#160;with the coffee tray.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A very remarkable story.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's the truth, sir. I swear to God it's the truth. I didn't know what it<br/>
&#160;&#160;was-not for a moment. It had a name on it-I thought it was just a piece of<br/>
&#160;&#160;music.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave looked at Lombard.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Was there a title on it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard nodded. He grinned suddenly, showing his white pointed teeth.&#160;&#160;He<br/>
&#160;said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Quite right, Sir. It was entitled Swan Song. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur broke out suddenly. He exclaimed:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=47></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;The whole thing is preposterous-preposterous! Slinging accusations about<br/>
&#160;like&#160;&#160;this! Something must be done about it. This fellow Owen whoever he is-<br/>
&#160;&#34;&#160;Emily Brent interrupted. She said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's just it, who is he?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge interposed. He spoke with the authority that a lifetime in the<br/>
&#160;&#160;courts had given him. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That is exactly what we must go into very carefully. I should sug-<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;gest that you get your wife to bed first of afl, Rogers. Then come back<br/>
&#160;here.&#34;&#160;&#34;Yes, Sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll give you a hand, Rogers.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Leaning on the two men, Mrs. Rogers tottered out of the room. When they had<br/>
&#160;gone&#160;&#160;Tony Marston said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't know about you, Sir, but I could do with a drink.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I agree.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Tony said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll go and forage.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He went out of the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He returned a second or two later.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Found them all waiting on a tray outside ready to be brought in.&#34; He set<br/>
&#160;down his&#160;burden carefully. The next minute or two was spent in dispensing<br/>
&#160;drinks. General&#160;Macarthur had a stiff whiskey and so did the judge. Every<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=48></a>&#160;one felt the need of a&#160;stimulant. Only Emily Brent demanded and obtained a<br/>
&#160;glass of water.&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong re-entered the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She's all right,&#34; he said. &#34;I've given her a sedative to take. What's<br/>
&#160;that, a&#160;&#160;drink? I could do with one.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Several of the men refilled their glasses. A moment or two later Rogers&#160;<br/>
&#160;re-entered the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave took charge of the proceedings. The room became an<br/>
&#160;impromptu&#160;&#160;court of law.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now then, Rogers, we must get to the bottom of this. Who is this Mr.<br/>
&#160;Owen?&#34;&#160;&#160;Rogers stared.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He owns this place, Sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I am aware of the fact. What I want you to teH me is what you yourself<br/>
&#160;know&#160;&#160;about the man.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers shook his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I can't say, Sir. You see, I've never seen him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a faint stir in the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You've never seen him? What d'yer mean?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We've only been here just under a week, Sir, my wife and 1. We were<br/>
&#160;engaged by&#160;&#160;letter, through an agency. The Regina Agency in Plymouth.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;222&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Old established firm,&#34; he volunteered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=49></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Have you got that letter?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;`I letter engaging us? No, Sir. I didn't keep it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Go on with your story. You were engaged, as you say, by letter.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, sir. We were to arrive on a certain day. We did. Everything was in<br/>
&#160;order&#160;&#160;here. Plenty of food in stock and everything very nice. Just needed<br/>
&#160;dusting and&#160;&#160;that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What next?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nothing, sir. We got orders-by letter again-to prepare the rooms for a&#160;<br/>
&#160;houseparty and then yesterday by the afternoon post I got another letter from<br/>
&#160;Mr.&#160;&#160;Owen. It said he and Mrs. Owen were detained and to do the best we<br/>
&#160;could and it&#160;&#160;gave the instructions about dinner and coffee and putting on<br/>
&#160;the gramophone&#160;&#160;record.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Surely you've got that letter?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, Sir, I've got it here.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He produced it from a pocket. The judge took it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;H'm,&#34; he said. &#34;Headed Ritz Hotel and typewritten.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;With a quick movement Blore was beside him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If you'll just let me have a look.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He twitched it out of the other's hand, and ran his eye over it. He<br/>
&#160;murmured:&#160;&#160;&#34;Coronation machine. Quite new-no defects. Ensign paper-the most<br/>
&#160;widely used&#160;&#160;make. You won't get anything out of that. Might be<br/>
&#160;fingerprints, but I doubt it.&#34;&#160;&#160;Wargrave stared at him with sudden<br/>
&#160;attention.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=50></a>&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston was standing beside Blore looking over his shoulder. He<br/>
&#160;said:&#160;&#160;&#34;Got some fancy Christian names, hasn't he? Ulick Norman Owen. Quite<br/>
&#160;a mouthful.&#34;&#160;&#160;The old judge said with a slight start:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I am obliged to you, Mr. Marston. You have drawn my attention to a curious<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;suggestive point.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He looked round at the others and thrusting his neck forward like an angry<br/>
&#160;&#160;tortoise, he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I think the time has come for us all to pool our information. It would be<br/>
&#160;well,&#160;&#160;I think, for everybody to come forward with all the information they<br/>
&#160;have&#160;&#160;regarding the owner of this house.&#34; He paused<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;223<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;and then went on. &#34;We are all his guests. I think it would be profitable if<br/>
&#160;each&#160;one of us were to explain exactly how that came about.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a moment's pause and then Emily Brent spoke with decision.&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;There's something very peculiar about all this,&#34; she said. &#34;I received a<br/>
&#160;letter&#160;&#160;with a signature that was not very easy to read. It purported to be<br/>
&#160;from a woman&#160;&#160;I had met at a certain summer resort two or three years ago.<br/>
&#160;I took the name to&#160;&#160;be either Ogden or Oliver. I am acquainted with a Mrs.<br/>
&#160;Oliver and also with a&#160;&#160;Miss Ogden. I am quite certain that I have never<br/>
&#160;met, or become friendly with,&#160;&#160;anyone of the name of Owen.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You have that letter, Miss Brent?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=51></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I will fetch it for you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She went away and returned a minute later with the letter.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge read it. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I begin to understand. . . . Miss Claythorne?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera explained the circumstances of her secretarial engagement. The judge<br/>
&#160;said:&#160;&#160;&#34;Marston?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Got a wire. From a pal of mine. Badger Berkeley. Surprised me at the time<br/>
&#160;&#160;because I had an idea the old horse had gone to Norway. Told me to roll up<br/>
&#160;here.&#34;&#160;&#160;Again Wargrave nodded. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Dr. Armstrong?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was called in professionally.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I see. You had no previous acquaintanceship with the family?&#34; &#34;No. A<br/>
&#160;colleague&#160;&#160;of mine was mentioned in the letter.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;To give verisimilitude. . . . Yes, and that colleague, I presume, was&#160;<br/>
&#160;momentarily out of touch with you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well-er-yes.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard, who had been staring at Blore, said suddenly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here, I've just thought of something-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge lifted a hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In a minute-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But 1-1)<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We will take one thing at a time, Mr. Lombard. We are at present inquiring<br/>
&#160;into&#160;&#160;the causes which have resulted in our being assembled here to-night.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=52></a>&#160;General&#160;&#160;Macarthur?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;224&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Pulling at his moustache, the General muttered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Got a letter-from this fellow Owen-mentioned some old pals of mine who<br/>
&#160;were to&#160;&#160;be here-hoped I'd excuse informal invitation. Haven't kept the<br/>
&#160;letter, I'm&#160;&#160;afraid.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Mr. Lombard?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard's brain had been active. Was he to come out in the open, or not?<br/>
&#160;He made&#160;&#160;up his mind.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Same sort of thing,&#34; he said. &#34;Invitation, mentioned of mutual friends-I<br/>
&#160;fell&#160;&#160;for it all right. I've tom up the letter.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave turned his attention to Mr. Blore. His forefinger<br/>
&#160;stroked&#160;&#160;his upper lip and his voice was dangerously polite.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said: &#34;Just now we had a somewhat disturbing experience. An apparently<br/>
&#160;&#160;disembodied voice spoke to us all by name, uttering certain precise<br/>
&#160;accusations&#160;&#160;against us. We will deal with those accusations presently. At<br/>
&#160;the moment I am&#160;&#160;interested in a minor point. Amongst the names recited was<br/>
&#160;that of William Henry&#160;&#160;Blore. But as far as we know there is no one named<br/>
&#160;Blore amongst us. The name of&#160;&#160;Davis was not mentioned. What have you to say<br/>
&#160;about that, Mr. Davis?&#34;&#160;Blore said sulkily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Cat's out of the bag, it seems. I suppose I'd better admit that my name<br/>
&#160;isn't&#160;&#160;Davis.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You are William Henry Blore?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's right.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=53></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I will add something,&#34; said Lombard. &#34;Not only are you here under a false<br/>
&#160;name,&#160;&#160;Mr. Blore, but in addition I've noticed this evening that you're a<br/>
&#160;first-class&#160;&#160;liar. You claim to have come from Natal, South Africa. I know<br/>
&#160;South Africa and&#160;&#160;Natal and I'm prepared to swear that you've never set foot<br/>
&#160;in South Africa in&#160;&#160;your life.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;All eyes were turned on Blore. Angry suspicious eyes. Anthony Marston moved<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;step nearer to him. His fists clenched themselves.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now then, you swine,&#34; he said. &#34;Any explanation?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore flung back his head and set his square jaw.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You gentlemen have got me wrong,&#34; he said. &#34;I've got my credentials and<br/>
&#160;you can&#160;&#160;see them. I'm an ex-C.I.D. man. I run a detective agency in<br/>
&#160;Plymouth. I was put&#160;&#160;on this job.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave asked: &#34;By whom?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;This man Owen. Enclosed a handsome money order for expenses and instructed<br/>
&#160;me&#160;&#160;as to what he wanted done. I was to join the<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;houseparty, posing as a guest. I was given all your names. I was to watch<br/>
&#160;you&#160;all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Any reason given?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said bitterly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Mrs. Owen's jewels. Mrs. Owen my foot! I don't believe there's any such<br/>
&#160;person.&#34;&#160;&#160;Again the forefinger of the judge stroked his lip, this time<br/>
&#160;appreciatively.&#160;&#160;&#34;Your conclusions are, I think, justified,&#34; he said. &#34;Ulick<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=54></a>&#160;Norman Owen! In Miss&#160;&#160;Brent's letter, though the signature of the surname<br/>
&#160;is a mere scrawl the&#160;&#160;Christian names are reasonably clear-Una Nancy -in<br/>
&#160;either case, you notice, the&#160;&#160;same initials. Ulick Norman OwenUna Nancy<br/>
&#160;Owen-each time, that is to say, U. N.&#160;&#160;Owen. Or by a slight stretch of<br/>
&#160;fancy, UNKNOWN!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But this is fantastic-mad!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge nodded gently.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, yes. I've no doubt in my own mind that we have been invited here by<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;madman-probably a dangerous homicidal lunatic.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;THERE WAS a moment's silence-a silence of dismay and bewilderment. Then the<br/>
&#160;judge's small clear voice took up the thread once more.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We will now proceed to the next stage of our inquiry. First, however, I<br/>
&#160;will&#160;&#160;just add my own credentials to the list.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He took a letter from his pocket and tossed it onto the table.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;This purports to be from an old friend of mine, Lady Constance Culmington.<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;have not seen her for some years. She went to the East. It is exactly the<br/>
&#160;kind&#160;&#160;of vague incoherent letter she would write, urging me to join her here<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;referring to her host and hostess in the vaguest of terms. The same<br/>
&#160;technique,&#160;&#160;you will observe. I only mention it because it agrees with the<br/>
&#160;other&#160;&#160;evidence-from all of which emerges one interesting point. Whoever it<br/>
&#160;was who&#160;&#160;enticed us here, that person knows or has taken the trouble to find<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=55></a>&#160;out a good&#160;&#160;deal about us all. He, whoever he may be, is aware of my<br/>
&#160;friendship for<br/>&#160;&#160;226<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lady Constance-and is familiar with her epistolary style. He knows something<br/>
&#160;about&#160;Dr. Armstrong's colleagues and their present whereabouts. He knows the<br/>
&#160;nickname&#160;of Mr. Marston's friend and the kind of telegrams he sends. He<br/>
&#160;knows exactly where&#160;Miss Brent was two years ago for her holiday and the<br/>
&#160;kind of people she met there.&#160;He knows all about General Macarthur's old<br/>
&#160;cronies.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused. Then he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He knows, you see, a good deal. And out of his knowledge concerning us,<br/>
&#160;he has&#160;&#160;made certain definite accusations.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Immediately a babel broke out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur shouted:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A pack of damn lies! Slander!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried out:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's iniquitous!&#34; Her breath came fast. &#34;Wicked!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said hoarsely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A lie-a wicked lie . . . we never did-neither of us.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston growled:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't know what the damned fool was getting at!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The upraised hand of Mr. Justice Wargrave calmed the tumult.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said, picking his words with care:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=56></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I wish to say this. Our unknown friend accuses me of the murder of one<br/>
&#160;Edward&#160;&#160;Seton. I remember Seton perfectly well. He came up before me for<br/>
&#160;trial in June&#160;&#160;of the year 1930. He was charged with the murder of an<br/>
&#160;elderly woman. He was very&#160;&#160;ably defended and made a good impression on the<br/>
&#160;jury in the witness box.&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, on the evidence, he was certainly<br/>
&#160;guilty. I summed up accordingly,&#160;&#160;and the jury brought in a verdict of<br/>
&#160;Guilty. In passing sentence of death I&#160;&#160;concurred with the verdict. An<br/>
&#160;appeal was lodged on the grounds of misdirection.&#160;&#160;The appeal was rejected<br/>
&#160;and the man was duly executed. I wish to say before you&#160;&#160;all that my<br/>
&#160;conscience is perfectly clear on the matter. I did my duty and&#160;&#160;nothing<br/>
&#160;more. I passed sentence on a rightly convicted murderer.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong was remembering now. The Seton case! The verdict had come as a<br/>
&#160;great&#160;&#160;surprise. He had met Matthews, K.C., on one of the days of the trial<br/>
&#160;dining at&#160;&#160;a restaurant. Matthews had been confident. &#34;Not a doubt of the<br/>
&#160;verdict. Acquittal&#160;&#160;practically certain.&#34; And then afterwards he had heard<br/>
&#160;comments: &#34;Judge was dead&#160;&#160;against him. Turned the jury right round and they<br/>
&#160;brought him in guilty. Quite&#160;&#160;legal, though. Old Wargrave knows his law.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#34;it was almost as though he had a&#160;&#160;private down on the fellow.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;All these memories rushed through the doctor's mind. Before he<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;could consider the wisdom of the question he had asked impulsively:&#160;&#160;&#34;Did<br/>
&#160;you know Seton at all? I mean previous to the case.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The hooded reptilian eyes met his. In a clear cold voice the judge said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=57></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I knew nothing of Seton previous to the case.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The fellow's lying-I know he's lying.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne spoke in a trembling voice. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'd like to tell you. About that child-Cyril Hamilton. I was nursery<br/>
&#160;governess&#160;&#160;to him. He was forbidden to swim out far. One day, when my<br/>
&#160;attention was&#160;&#160;distracted, he started off. I swam after him<br/>
&#160; &#160;I couldn't get there in time. . . . It was awful. . . . But it wasn't my<br/>
&#160;fault.&#160; &#160;At the inquest the Coroner exonerated me. And his mother-she was<br/>
&#160;so kind. If&#160; &#160;even she didn't blame me, why shouldwhy should this awful<br/>
&#160;thing be said? It's&#160; &#160;not f air-not fair.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She broke down, weeping bitterly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur patted her shoulder. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;) I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There, there, my dear. Of course it's not true. Fellow's a madman. A<br/>
&#160;madman! Got&#160;&#160;a bee in his bonnet! Got hold of the wrong end of the stick all<br/>
&#160;round.&#34;&#160;&#160;He stood erect, squaring his shoulders. He barked out:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Best really to leave this sort of thing unanswered. However, feel I ought<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;say-no truth-no truth whatever in what he said about-eryoung Arthur<br/>
&#160;Richmond.&#160;&#160;Richmond was one of my officers. I sent him on a reconnaissance.<br/>
&#160;He was killed.&#160;&#160;Natural course of events in war time. Wish to say resent<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=58></a>&#160;very much-slur on my&#160;&#160;wife. Best woman in the world. Absolutely-Caesar's<br/>
&#160;wife!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur sat down. His shaking hand pulled at his moustache. The<br/>
&#160;effort&#160;&#160;to speak had cost him a good deal.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard spoke. His eyes were amused. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;About those natives-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Marston said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What about them?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard grinned.<br/>
&#160;&#160;228&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Story's quite true! I left 'em! Matter of self-preservation. We were lost<br/>
&#160;in the&#160;&#160;bush. I and a couple of other fellows took what food there was and<br/>
&#160;cleared out.&#34;&#160;General Macarthur said sternly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You abandoned your men-left them to starve?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not quite the act of a pukka sahib, I'm afraid. But self-preservation's<br/>
&#160;a man's&#160;&#160;first duty. And natives don't mind dying, you know. They don't feel<br/>
&#160;about it as&#160;&#160;Europeans do.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera lifted her face from her hands. She said, staring at him:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You left them-to die?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard answered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I left them to die.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His amused eyes looked into her horrified ones.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston said in a slow puzzled voice:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=59></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I've just been thinking-John and Lucy Combes. Must have been a couple of<br/>
&#160;kids&#160;&#160;I ran over near Cambridge. Beastly bad luck.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said acidly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;For them, or for you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, I was thinking-for me-but of course, you're right, Sir, it was<br/>
&#160;damned bad&#160;&#160;luck on them. Of course it was a pure accident. They rushed out<br/>
&#160;of some cottage&#160;&#160;or other. I had my licence endorsed for a year. Beastly<br/>
&#160;nuisance.&#34;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said warmly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;This speeding's all wrong-all wrong! Young men like you are a danger to<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;community.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Speed's come to stay. English roads are hopeless, of course. Can't get up<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;decent pace on them.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He looked round vaguely for his glass, picked it up off a table and went<br/>
&#160;over to&#160;&#160;the side table and helped himself to another whiskey and soda. He<br/>
&#160;said over his&#160;&#160;shoulder:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, anyway, it wasn't my fault. Just an accident!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;229<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=60></a>&#160;&#160;The manservant, Rogers, had been moistening his lips and twisting his<br/>
&#160;hands. He&#160;&#160;said now in a low deferential voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If I might just say a word, Sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Go ahead, Rogers.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers cleared his throat and passed his tongue once more over his dry<br/>
&#160;lips.&#160;&#160;&#34;There was a mention, sir, of me and Mrs. Rogers. And of Miss Brady.<br/>
&#160;There isn't&#160;&#160;a word of truth in it, sir. My wife and I were with Miss Brady<br/>
&#160;till she died. She&#160;&#160;was always in poor health, Sir, always from the time we<br/>
&#160;came to her. There was&#160;&#160;a storm, Sir, that night-the night she was taken<br/>
&#160;bad. The telephone was out of&#160;&#160;order. We couldn't get the doctor to her. I<br/>
&#160;went for him, sir, on foot. But he&#160;&#160;got there too late. We'd done everything<br/>
&#160;possible for her, Sir. Devoted to her,&#160;&#160;we were. Any one will tell you the<br/>
&#160;same. There was never a word said against us.&#160;&#160;Not a word.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard looked thoughtfully at the man's twitching face, his dry lips, the<br/>
&#160;fright&#160;&#160;in his eyes. He remembered the crash of the falling coffee tray. He<br/>
&#160;thought, but&#160;&#160;did not say, &#34;Oh, yeah?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore spoke-spoke in his hearty bullying official manner.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Came into a little something at her death, though? Eh?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers drew himself up. He said stiffly: -<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Miss Brady left us a legacy in recognition of our faithful services. And<br/>
&#160;why&#160;&#160;not, I'd like to know?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What about yourself, Mr. Blore?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=61></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;What about me?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Your name was included in the list.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore went purple.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Landor, you mean? That was the bank robbery-London and Commercial.&#34;&#160;Mr.<br/>
&#160;Justice Wargrave stirred. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I remember. It didn't come before me, but I remember the case. Landor was<br/>
&#160;&#160;convicted on your evidence. You were the police officer in charge of the<br/>
&#160;case?&#34;<br/>&#160;&#160;230&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;iti was.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Landor got penal servitude for life and died in Dartmoor a year later. He<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;a delicate man.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He was a crook. It was he who knocked out the night watchman. The case was<br/>
&#160;quite&#160;&#160;clear against him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargave said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You were complimented, I think, on your able handling of the case.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Blore said sulkily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I got my promotion.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He added in a thick voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was only doing my duty.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard laughed-a sudden ringing laugh. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=62></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;What a duty-loving, law-abiding lot we all seem to be! Myself excepted.<br/>
&#160;What&#160;&#160;about you, doctor-and your little professional mistake? Illegal<br/>
&#160;operation, was&#160;&#160;it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent glanced at him in sharp distaste and drew herself away a<br/>
&#160;little.&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong, very much master of himself, shook his head<br/>
&#160;goodhumouredly.&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm at a loss to understand the matter,&#34; he said. &#34;The<br/>
&#160;name meant nothing to me&#160;&#160;when it was spoken. What was it-Clees? Close? I<br/>
&#160;really can't remember having a&#160;&#160;patient of that name, or being connected<br/>
&#160;with a death in any way. The thing's a&#160;&#160;complete mystery to me. Of course,<br/>
&#160;it's a long time ago. It might possibly be one&#160;&#160;of my operation cases in<br/>
&#160;hospital. They come too late, so many of these people.&#160;&#160;Then, when the<br/>
&#160;patient dies, they always consider it's the surgeon's fault.&#34;&#160;&#160;He sighed,<br/>
&#160;shaking his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;Drunk-that's what it was-drunk. And I operated! Nerves all to pieces-hands<br/>
&#160;&#160;shaking. I killed her, all right. Poor devil-elderly woman-simple job if I'd<br/>
&#160;been&#160;&#160;sober. Lucky for me there's loyalty in our profession. The Sister<br/>
&#160;knew, of&#160;&#160;course-but she held her tongue. God, it gave me a shock! Pulled<br/>
&#160;me up. But who&#160;&#160;could have known about it-af ter all these years?<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;231<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=63></a>&#160;&#160;There was a silence in the room. Everybody was looking, covertly or openly,<br/>
&#160;at&#160;&#160;Emily Brent. It was a minute or two before she became aware of the<br/>
&#160;expectation.&#160;&#160;Her eyebrows rose on her narrow forehead. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Are you waiting for me to say something? I have nothing to say.&#34; The judge<br/>
&#160;said:&#160;&#160;&#34;Nothing, Miss Brent?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nothing.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her lips closed tightly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge stroked his face. He said mildly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You reserve your defence?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent said coldly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There is no question of defence. I have always acted in accordance with<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;dictates of my conscience. I have nothing with which to reproach<br/>
&#160;myself.&#34;&#160;&#160;There was an unsatisfied feeling in the air. But Emily Brent was<br/>
&#160;not one to be&#160;&#160;swayed by public opinion. She sat unyielding.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge cleared his throat once or twice. Then he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Our inquiry rests there. Now, Rogers, who else is there on this island<br/>
&#160;besides&#160;&#160;ourselves and you and your wife?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nobody, Sir. Nobody at all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're sure of that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Quite sure, Sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I am not yet clear as to the purpose of our Unknown host in getting us to<br/>
&#160;&#160;assemble here. But in my opinion this person, whoever he may be, is not sane<br/>
&#160;in&#160;&#160;the accepted sense of the word.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He may be dangerous. In my opinion it would be well for us to leave this<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=64></a>&#160;place&#160;&#160;as soon as possible. I suggest that we leave to-night.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I beg your pardon, sir, but there's no boat on the island.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No boat at all?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;How do you communicate with the mainland?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Fred Narracott, he comes over every morning, sir. He brings the bread and<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;milk and the post, and takes the orders.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;232&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Then in my opinion it would be well if we all left to-morrow morning as<br/>
&#160;soon&#160;&#160;as Narracott's boat arrives.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a chorus of agreement with only one dissentient voice. It was&#160;<br/>
&#160;Anthony Marston who disagreed with the majority.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A bit unsporting, what?&#34; he said. &#34;Ought to ferret out the mystery before<br/>
&#160;we&#160;&#160;go. Whole thing's like a detective story. Positively thrilling.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said acidly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;At my time of life, I have no desire for 'thrills,' as you call them.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Anthony said with a grin:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The legal life's narrowing! I'm all for crime! Here's to it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He picked up his drink and drank it off at a gulp. I<br/>
&#160;&#160;Too quickly, perhaps. He choked-choked badly. His face contorted, turned<br/>
&#160;&#160;purple. He gasped for breath-then slid down off his chair, the glass falling<br/>
&#160;&#160;from his hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=65></a>&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;IT WAS so sudden and so unexpected that it took every one's breath away.<br/>
&#160;They&#160;remained stupidly staring at the crumpled figure on the floor.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then Dr. Armstrong jumped up and went over to him, kneeling beside him.<br/>
&#160;When&#160;&#160;he raised his head his eyes were bewildered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said in a low awe-struck whisper:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My God! he's dead.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They didn't take it in. Not at once.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dead? Dead? That young Norse God in the prime of his health and strength.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Struck down all in a moment. Healthy young men didn't die like that, choking<br/>
&#160;&#160;over a whiskey and soda. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;No, they couldn't take it in.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong was peering into the dead man's face. He sniffed at the blue<br/>
&#160;&#160;twisted lips. Then he picked up the glass from which Anthony Marston had<br/>
&#160;been&#160;&#160;drinking.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Dead? D'you mean the fellow just choked and-and died?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The physician said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;233<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You can call it choking if you like. He died of asphyxiation right<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=66></a>&#160;enough.&#34;&#160;&#160;He was sniffing now at the glass. He dipped a finger into the<br/>
&#160;dregs and very&#160;&#160;cautiously just touched the finger with the tip of his<br/>
&#160;tongue.<br/>
&#160;&#160;His expression altered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Never knew a man could die like that-just of a choking fit!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said in a clear voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In the midst of life we are in death.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Annstrong stood up. He said brusquely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, a man doesn't die of a mere choking fit. Marston's death wasn't what<br/>
&#160;we call&#160;&#160;a natural death.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said almost in a whisper:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Was there-something-in the whiskey?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes. Can't say exactly. Everything points to one of the Cyanides. No<br/>
&#160;distinctive&#160;&#160;smell of Prussic Acid, probably Potassium Cyanide. It acts<br/>
&#160;pretty well&#160;&#160;instantaneously.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It was in his glass?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor strode to the table where the drinks were. He removed the<br/>
&#160;stopper from&#160;&#160;the whiskey and smelt and tasted it. Then he tasted the soda<br/>
&#160;water. He shook his&#160;&#160;head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;They're both all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You mean-he must have put the stuff in his glass himself?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=67></a>&#160;&#160;Armstrong nodded with a curiously dissatisfied expression. He said:&#160;&#34;Seems<br/>
&#160;like it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Suicide, eh? That's a queer go.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'd never think that he would kill himself. He was so alive. He&#160;&#160;was-<br/>
&#160;oh---enjoying himself! When he came down the hill in his car this evening he<br/>
&#160;&#160;looked-he looked-oh, I can't explain!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But they knew what she meant. Anthony Marston, in the height of his youth<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;manhood, had seemed like a being who was immortal. And now, crumpled<br/>
&#160;and broken,&#160;&#160;he lay on the floor.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Is there any possibility other than suicide?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;234&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Slowly every one shook his head. There could be no other explanation. The<br/>
&#160;drinks&#160;&#160;themselves were untampered with. They had all seen Anthony Marston<br/>
&#160;go across and&#160;&#160;help himself. It followed therefore that any Cyanide in the<br/>
&#160;drink must have been&#160;&#160;put there by Anthony Marston himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And yet-why should Anthony Marston commit suicide?<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said thoughtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You know, doctor, it doesn't seem right to me. I shouldn't have said Mr.<br/>
&#160;Marston&#160;&#160;was a suicidal type of gentleman.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong answered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I agree.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=68></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They had left it like that. What else was there to say? Together Armstrong<br/>
&#160;and&#160;Lombard had carried the inert body of Anthony Marston to his bedroom and<br/>
&#160;had laid&#160;him there covered over with a sheet. When they came downstairs<br/>
&#160;again, the others&#160;were standing in a group, shivering a little, though the<br/>
&#160;night was not cold. Emily&#160;Brent said: &#34;We'd better go to bed. It's late.&#34;<br/>
&#160;It was past twelve o'clock. The&#160;suggestion was a wise one-yet every one<br/>
&#160;hesitated. It was as though they clung to&#160;each other's company for<br/>
&#160;reassurance. The judge said: &#34;Yes, we must get some&#160;sleep.&#34; Rogers said: &#34;I<br/>
&#160;haven't cleared yet-in the dining-room.&#34; Lombard said&#160;curtly: &#34;Do it in the<br/>
&#160;morning.&#34; Armstrong said to him: &#34;Is your wife all right?&#34;&#160;&#34;I'll go and see,<br/>
&#160;Sir.&#34; He returned a minute or two later. &#34;Sleeping beautiful,&#160;she is.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#34;Good,&#34; said the doctor. &#34;Don't disturb her.&#34; &#34;No, sir. I'll just put&#160;things<br/>
&#160;straight in the dining-room and make sure everything's locked up right, and<br/>
&#160;then I'll turn in.&#34; He went across the hall into the dining-room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The others went upstairs, a slow unwilling procession.<br/>
&#160;&#160;If this had been an old house, with creaking wood, and dark shadows, and<br/>
&#160;heavily&#160;&#160;panelled walls, there might have been an eerie feeling. But this<br/>
&#160;house was the&#160;&#160;essence of modernity. There were no dark comers-no possible<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=69></a>&#160;sliding panels-it was&#160;&#160;flooded with electric lighteverything was new and<br/>
&#160;bright and shining. There was&#160;&#160;nothing hidden in this house, nothing<br/>
&#160;concealed. It had no atmosphere about it.&#160;&#160;Somehow, that was the most<br/>
&#160;frightening thing of all.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They exchanged good-nights on the upper landing. Each of them went into his<br/>
&#160;or&#160;&#160;her own room, and each of them automatically, almost without conscious<br/>
&#160;thought,&#160;&#160;locked the door. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;In his pleasant softly tinted room, Mr. Justice Wargrave removed his<br/>
&#160;garments and&#160;&#160;prepared himself for bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He was thinking about Edward Seton.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He remembered Seton very well. His fair hair, his blue eyes, his habit of<br/>
&#160;looking&#160;&#160;you straight in the face with a pleasant air of<br/>
&#160;straightforwardness. That was&#160;&#160;what had made so good an impression on the<br/>
&#160;jury.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Llewellyn, for the Crown, had bungled it a bit. He had been overvehement,<br/>
&#160;had&#160;&#160;tried to prove too much.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Matthews, on the other hand, for the Defence, had been good. His points had<br/>
&#160;told.&#160;&#160;His cross-examinations had been deadly. His handling of his client<br/>
&#160;in the witness&#160;&#160;box had been masterly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And Seton had come through the ordeal of cross-examination well. He had not<br/>
&#160;got&#160;&#160;excited or over-vehement. The jury had been impressed. It had seemed<br/>
&#160;to Matthews,&#160;&#160;perhaps, as though everything had been over bar the shouting.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=70></a>&#160;&#160;The judge wound up his watch carefully and placed it by the bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He remembered exactly how he had felt sitting there-listening, making<br/>
&#160;notes,&#160;&#160;appreciating everything, tabulating every scrap of evidence that<br/>
&#160;told against the&#160;&#160;prisoner.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd enjoyed that case! Matthews' final speech had been first-class.<br/>
&#160;Llewellyn,&#160;&#160;coming after it, had failed to remove the good impression that<br/>
&#160;the defending&#160;&#160;counsel had made.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then had come his own summing up. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Carefully, Mr. Justice Wargrave removed his false teeth and<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;dropped them into a glass of water. The shrunken lips fell in. It was a<br/>
&#160;cruel&#160;mouth now, cruel and predatory.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Hooding his eyes, the judge smiled to himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd cooked Seton's goose all right!<br/>
&#160;&#160;With a slightly rheumatic grunt, he climbed into bed and turned out the&#160;<br/>
&#160;electric light.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Downstairs in the dining-room, Rogers stood puzzled. He was staring at the<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=71></a>&#160;china figures in the centre of the table. He muttered to himself: &#34;That's a<br/>
&#160;rum&#160;go! I could have sworn there were ten of them.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur tossed from side to side.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Sleep would not come to him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the darkness he kept seeing Arthur Richmond's face.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd liked Arthur-he'd been damned fond of Arthur. He'd been pleased that<br/>
&#160;Leslie&#160;&#160;liked him too.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Leslie was so capricious. Lots of good fellows that Leslie would turn up<br/>
&#160;her nose&#160;&#160;at and pronounce dull. &#34;Dull!&#34; Just like that.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But she hadn't found Arthur Richmond dull. They'd got on well together from<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;beginning. They'd talked of plays and music and pictures together.<br/>
&#160;She'd teased&#160;&#160;him, made fun of him, ragged him. And he, Macarthur, had been<br/>
&#160;delighted at the&#160;&#160;thought that Leslie took quite a motherly interest in the<br/>
&#160;boy.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Motherly indeed! Damn fool not to remember that Richmond was twenty-eight<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;Leslie's twenty-nine.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd loved Leslie. He could see her now. Her heart-shaped face, and her<br/>
&#160;dancing&#160;&#160;deep grey eyes, and the brown curling mass of her hair. He'd loved<br/>
&#160;Leslie and&#160;&#160;&#160;he'd believed in her absolutely.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Out there in France, in the middle of all the hell of it, he'd sat thinking<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;her, taken her picture out of the breast pocket of his tunic.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then-he'd found out!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=72></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;It had come about exactly in the way things happened in books, The letter<br/>
&#160;in the&#160;&#160;wrong envelope. She'd been writing to them both and she'd put her<br/>
&#160;letter to&#160;&#160;Richmond in the envelope addressed to her husband. Even now, all<br/>
&#160;these years&#160;&#160;after, he could feel the shock of it-the pain. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;God, it had hurt!<br/>
&#160;&#160;And the business had been going on some time. The letter made that clear.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Week-ends! Richmond's last leave. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Leslie-Leslie and Arthur!<br/>
&#160;&#160;God damn the fellow! Damn his smiling face, his brisk &#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Liar and<br/>
&#160;&#160;hypocrite! Stealer of another man's wife!<br/>
&#160;&#160;It had gathered slowly-that cold murderous rage.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd managed to carry on as usual-to show nothing. He'd tried to make his<br/>
&#160;manner&#160;&#160;to Richmond just the same.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Had he succeeded? He thought so. Richmond hadn't suspected. Inequalities<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;temper were easily accounted for out there, where men's nerves were<br/>
&#160;continually&#160;&#160;snapping under the strain.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Only young Armitage had looked at him curiously once or twice. Quite a<br/>
&#160;young&#160;&#160;chap, but he'd had perceptions, that boy.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armitage, perhaps, had guessed-when the time came.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd sent Richmond deliberately to death. Only a miracle could have brought<br/>
&#160;him&#160;&#160;through unhurt. That miracle didn't happen. Yes, he'd sent Richmond to<br/>
&#160;his death&#160;&#160;and he wasn't sorry. It had been easy enough. Mistakes were being<br/>
&#160;made all the&#160;&#160;time, officers being sent to death needlessly. All was<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=73></a>&#160;confusion, panic. People&#160;&#160;might say afterwards, &#34;Old Macarthur lost his<br/>
&#160;nerve a bit, made some colossal&#160;&#160;blunders, sacrificed some of his best men.&#34;<br/>
&#160;They couldn't say more.&#160;&#160;But young Armitage was different. He'd looked at<br/>
&#160;his commanding officer very&#160;&#160;oddly. He'd known, perhaps, that Richmond was<br/>
&#160;being deliberately sent to death.&#160;&#160;(And after the War was over-had Armitage<br/>
&#160;talked?)<br/>
&#160;&#160;Leslie hadn't known. Leslie had wept for her lover (he supposed) but her<br/>
&#160;weeping&#160;&#160;was over by the time he'd come back to England. He'd never told her<br/>
&#160;that he'd&#160;&#160;found her out. They'd gone on together -only, somehow, she hadn't<br/>
&#160;seemed very&#160;&#160;real any more. And then, three or four years later, she'd got<br/>
&#160;double pneumonia&#160;&#160;and died.<br/>
&#160;&#160;That had been a long time ago. Fifteen years-sixteen years?<br/>
&#160;&#160;And he'd left the Army and come to live in Devon-bought the sort of little<br/>
&#160;place&#160;&#160;&#160;he'd always meant to have. Nice neighbourspleasant part of the world.<br/>
&#160;There was&#160;&#160;a bit of shooting and fishing. He'd gone to church on Sundays.<br/>
&#160;(But not the day&#160;&#160;that the lesson<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;was read about David putting Uriah in the forefront of the battle. Somehow<br/>
&#160;he&#160;couldn't face that. Gave him an uncomfortable feeling.)<br/>
&#160;&#160;Everybody had been very friendly. At first, that is. Later, he'd had an<br/>
&#160;uneasy&#160;&#160;feeling that people were talking about him behind his back. They<br/>
&#160;eyed him&#160;&#160;differently, somehow. As though they'd heard something-some lying<br/>
&#160;rumour. . . .&#160;(Armitage? Supposing Armitage had talked?)<br/>
&#160;&#160;He'd avoided people after that-withdrawn into himself. Unpleasant to feel<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=74></a>&#160;that&#160;&#160;people were discussing you.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And all so long ago. So-so purposeless now. Leslie had faded into the<br/>
&#160;distance&#160;&#160;and Arthur Richmond, too. Nothing of what had happened seemed to<br/>
&#160;matter any more.&#160;&#160;It made life lonely, though. He'd taken to shunning his<br/>
&#160;old Army friends.&#160;(If Armitage had talked, they'd know about it.)<br/>
&#160;&#160;And now-this evening-a hidden voice had blared out that old hidden story.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Had he dealt with it all right? Kept a stiff upper lip? Betrayed the right<br/>
&#160;amount&#160;&#160;of feeling-indignation, disgust-but no guilt, no discomfiture?<br/>
&#160;Difficult to tell.&#160;&#160;Surely nobody could have taken the accusation seriously.<br/>
&#160;There had been a pack&#160;&#160;of other nonsense, just as far-fetched. That charming<br/>
&#160;girl-the voice had accused&#160;&#160;her of drowning a child! Idiotic! Some madman<br/>
&#160;throwing crazy accusations about!&#160;&#160;Emily Brent, too-actually a niece of old<br/>
&#160;Tom Brent of the Regiment. It had&#160;&#160;accused her of murder! Any one could see<br/>
&#160;with half an eye that the woman was as&#160;&#160;pious as could be-the kind that was<br/>
&#160;hand and glove with parsons.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Damned curious business the whole thing! Crazy, nothing less.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ever since they had got here-when was that? Why, damn it, it was only this<br/>
&#160;&#160;afternoon! Seemed a good bit longer than that.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought: &#34;I wonder when we shall get away again.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;To-morrow, of course, when the motor boat came from the mainland.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Funny, just this minute he didn't want much to get away from the island.<br/>
&#160;. . .&#160;&#160;To go back to the mainland, back to his little house, back to all the<br/>
&#160;troubles&#160;&#160;and worries. Through the open window he could hear the waves<br/>
&#160;breaking on the&#160;&#160;rocks-a little louder now than earlier in the evening. Wind<br/>
&#160;was getting up, too.&#160;He thought: Peaceful sound. Peaceful place. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=75></a>&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;239<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought: Best of an island is once you get there-you can't go any<br/>
&#160;further .&#160;&#160;. . you've come to the end of things.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He knew, suddenly, that he didn't want to leave the island.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;6<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne lay in bed, wide awake, staring up at the ceiling. The light<br/>
&#160;beside her was on. She was frightened of the dark.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She was thinking:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Hugo . . . Hugo . . . Why do I feel you're so near to me tonight? . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Somewhere quite close. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Where is he really? I don't know. I never shall know. He just went away-<br/>
&#160;right&#160;&#160;away-out of my life.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was no good trying not to think of Hugo. He was close to her. She had<br/>
&#160;to think&#160;&#160;of him-to remember . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Cornwall . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;The black rocks, the smooth yellow sand. Mrs. Hamilton, stout, good-<br/>
&#160;humoured.&#160;&#160;Cyril, whining a little always, pulling at her hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I want to swim out to the rock, Miss Claythorne. Why can't I swim out to<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;rock?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Looking up-meeting Hugo's eyes watching her.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=76></a>&#160;&#160;The evenings after Cyril was in bed . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Come out for a stroll, Miss Claythorne.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I think perhaps I will.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The decorous stroll down to the beach. The moonlight-the soft Atlantic air.<br/>
&#160;And then, Hugo's arms round her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I love you. I love you. You know I love you, Vera?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Yes, she knew.<br/>
&#160;&#160;(Or thought she knew.)<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I can't ask you to marry me. I've not got a penny. It's all I can do to<br/>
&#160;keep&#160;&#160;myself. Queer, you know, once, for three months I had the chance of<br/>
&#160;being a rich&#160;&#160;man to look forward to. Cyril wasn't born until three months<br/>
&#160;after Maurice died.&#160;&#160;If he'd been a girl . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;If the child had been a girl, Hugo would have come into everything. He'd<br/>
&#160;been&#160;&#160;disappointed, he admitted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I hadn't built on it, of course. But it was a bit of a knock. Oh, well,<br/>
&#160;luck's&#160;&#160;luck! Cyril's a nice kid. I'm awfully fond of him.&#34; And he<br/>
&#160;&#160;240&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;was fond of him, too. Always ready to play games or amuse his small&#160;nephew.<br/>
&#160;No rancour in Hugo's nature.&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;Cyril wasn't really strong. A puny child-no stamina. The kind of child,&#160;<br/>
&#160;perhaps, who wouldn't live to grow up.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then-?<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Miss Claythorne, why can't I swim to the rock?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Irritating whiney repetition.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=77></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;It's too far, Cyril.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But, Miss Claythorne . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera got up. She went to the dressing-table and swallowed three aspirins.<br/>
&#160;She thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I wish I had some proper sleeping stuff.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If I were doing away with myself I'd take an overdose of Veronal -<br/>
&#160;something&#160;&#160;like that-not Cyanide!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She shuddered as she remembered Anthony Marston's convulsed purple face.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As she passed the mantelpiece, she looked up at the framed doggerel.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;<br/>
&#160;&#160;One choked his little self and then there were nine.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She thought to herself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's horrible-just like us this evening.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Why had Anthony Marston wanted to die?<br/>
&#160;&#160;She didn't want to die.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She couldn't imagine wanting to die.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Death was for-the other people. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 6<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;DR. ARMSTRONG was dreaming. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was very hot in the operating room. . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=78></a>&#160;&#160;Surely they'd got the temperature too high? The sweat was rolling down his<br/>
&#160;&#160;face. His hands were clammy. Difficult to hold the scalpel firmly. . . .&#160;<br/>
&#160;How beautifully sharp it was. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;241<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Easy to do a murder with a knife like that. And of course he was doing a<br/>
&#160;murder.&#160;&#160;The woman's body looked different. It had been a large unwieldy<br/>
&#160;body. This was&#160;&#160;a spare meagre body. And the face was hidden.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Who was it that he had to kill?<br/>
&#160;&#160;He couldn't remember. But he must know! Should he ask Sister?<br/>
&#160;&#160;Sister was watching him. No, he couldn't ask her. She was suspicious, he<br/>
&#160;could&#160;&#160;see that.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But who was it on the operating table?<br/>
&#160;&#160;They shouldn't have covered up the face like that.<br/>
&#160;&#160;If he could only see the face. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ah! that was better. A young probationer was pulling off the handkerchief.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent, of course. It was Emily Brent that he had to kill. How<br/>
&#160;malicious her&#160;&#160;eyes were! Her lips were moving. What was she saying?<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In the midst of life we are in death. 21<br/>
&#160;&#160;She was laughing now. No, nurse, don't put the handkerchief back. I've got<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;see. I've got to give the anaesthetic. Where's the ether? I must have<br/>
&#160;brought the&#160;&#160;ether with me. What have you done with the ether, Sister?<br/>
&#160;ChAteau Neuf du Pape?&#160;&#160;Yes, that will do quite as well.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=79></a>&#160;&#160;Take the handkerchief away, nurse.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Of course! I knew it all the time! It's Anthony Marston! His face is purple<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;convulsed. But he's not dead-he's laughing. I tell you he's laughing!<br/>
&#160;He's&#160;&#160;shaking the operating table.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Look out, man, look out. Nurse, steady it-steady-it-<br/>
&#160;&#160;With a start Dr. Armstrong woke up. It was morning. Sunlight was pouring<br/>
&#160;into the&#160;&#160;room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And some one was leaning over him-shaking him. It was Rogers. Rogers, with<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;white face, saying: &#34;Doctor-doctor!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong woke up completely.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He sat up in bed. He said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What is it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's the wife, doctor. I can't get her to wake. My God! I can't get her<br/>
&#160;to wake.&#160;&#160;And-and she don't look right to me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong was quick and efficient. He wrapped himself in his dressing-<br/>
&#160;gown&#160;&#160;and followed Rogers.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He bent over the bed where the woman was lying peacefully on her side. He<br/>
&#160;lifted&#160;&#160;the cold hand, raised the eyelid. It was some few minutes before be<br/>
&#160;straightened&#160;&#160;himself and turned from the bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers whispered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;242&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Is-she-is she-V<br/>
&#160;&#160;He passed a tongue over dry lips.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong nodded.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=80></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, she's gone.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His eyes rested thoughtfully on the man before him. Then they went to the<br/>
&#160;table&#160;&#160;by the bed, to the washstand, then back to the sleeping woman.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Was it-was it-'er 'eart, doctor?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong was a minute or two before replying. Then he said: &#34;What was<br/>
&#160;her&#160;&#160;health like normally?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She was a bit rheumaticky.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Any doctor been attending her recently?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Doctor?&#34; Rogers stared. &#34;Not been to a doctor for years-neither of us.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'd no reason to believe she suffered from heart trouble?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, doctor. I never knew of anything.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Did she sleep well?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Now Rogers' eyes evaded his. The man's hands came together and turned and<br/>
&#160;twisted&#160;&#160;uneasily. He muttered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She didn't sleep extra well-no.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Did she take things to make her sleep?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers stared at him, surprised.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Take things? To make her sleep? Not that I knew of. I'm sure she didn't.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong went over to the washstand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There were a certain number of bottles on it. Hair lotion, lavender water,<br/>
&#160;&#160;cascara, glycerine of cucumber for the hands, a mouth wash, tooth paste and<br/>
&#160;some&#160;&#160;Elliman's.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=81></a>&#160;&#160;Rogers helped by pulling out the drawers of the dressing-table. From there<br/>
&#160;they&#160;&#160;moved on to the chest of drawers. But there was no sign of sleeping<br/>
&#160;draughts or&#160;&#160;tablets.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She didn't have nothing last night, sir, except what you gave her. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;243<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;When the gong sounded for breakfast at nine o'clock it found every one up<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;awaiting the summons.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur and the judge had been pacing the terrace outside,&#160;<br/>
&#160;exchanging desultory comments on the political situation.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythome and Philip Lombard had been up to the summit of the island<br/>
&#160;&#160;behind the house. There they had discovered William Henry Blore, standing<br/>
&#160;&#160;staring at the mainland.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No sign of that motor boat yet. I've been watching for it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said, smiling:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Devon's a sleepy county. Things are usually late.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard was looking the other way, out to sea.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said abruptly:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=82></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;What d'you think of the weather?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Glancing up at the sky, Blore remarked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Looks all right to me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard pursed up his mouth into a whistle.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It will come on to blow before the day's out.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Squally-eh?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;From below them came the boom of a gong.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Breakfast? Well, I could do with some.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;As they went down the steep slope Blore said to Lombard in a ruminating<br/>
&#160;voice:&#160;&#160;&#34;You know, it beats me-why that young fellow wanted to do himself<br/>
&#160;in! I've&#160;&#160;been worrying about it all night.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera was a little ahead. Lombard hung back slightly. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Got any alternative theory?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'd want some proof. Motive, to begin with. Well off I should say he was.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent came out of the drawing-room door to meet them.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Is the boat coming?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not yet,&#34; said Vera.<br/>
&#160;&#160;244&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They went in to breakfast. There was a vast dish of eggs and bacon on the<br/>
&#160;&#160;sideboard and tea and coffee.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers held the door open for them to pass in, then shut it from the<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=83></a>&#160;outside.&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That man looks ill this morning.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong, who was standing by the window, cleared his throat. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You must excuse any-er-shortcomings this morning. Rogers has had to do the<br/>
&#160;best&#160;&#160;he can for breakfast single-handed. Mrs. Rogers has-er-not been able<br/>
&#160;to carry on&#160;&#160;this morning.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's the matter with the woman?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said easily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Let us start our breakfast. The eggs will be cold. Afterwards, there are<br/>
&#160;several&#160;&#160;matters I want to discuss with you all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They took the hint. Plates were filled, coffee and tea was poured. The meal<br/>
&#160;&#160;began.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Discussion of the island was, by mutual consent, tabooed. They spoke<br/>
&#160;instead in&#160;&#160;a desultory fashion of current events. The news from abroad,<br/>
&#160;events in the world&#160;&#160;of sport, the latest reappearance of the Loch Ness<br/>
&#160;monster.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then, when plates were cleared, Dr. Armstrong moved back his chair a<br/>
&#160;little,&#160;&#160;cleared his throat importantly and spoke.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I thought it better to wait until you had had your breakfast before<br/>
&#160;telling you&#160;&#160;of a sad piece of news. Mrs. Rogers died in her sleep.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There were startled and shocked ejaculations.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera exclaimed:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;How awful! Two deaths on this island since we arrived!&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=84></a>&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave, his eyes narrowed, said in his small precise clear<br/>
&#160;voice:&#160;&#34;H'm-very remarkable-what was the cause of death?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Impossible to say offhand.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There must be an autopsy?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I certainly couldn't give a certificate. I have no knowledge whatsoever<br/>
&#160;of the&#160;&#160;woman's state of health.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She was a very nervous-looking creature. And she had a shock last night.<br/>
&#160;It&#160;&#160;might have been heart failure, I suppose?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said drily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Her heart certainly failed to beat-but what caused it to fail is the&#160;<br/>
&#160;question. &#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;One word fell from Emily Brent. It fell hard and clear into the listening<br/>
&#160;&#160;group.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Conscience!&#34; she said.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong turned to her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What exactly do you mean by that, Miss Brent?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent, her lips tight and hard, said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You all heard. She was accused, together with her husband, of<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;having deliberately murdered her former employer-an old lad<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And you think?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=85></a>&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;(i<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;245<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;.7 .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I think that that accusation was true. You all saw her last night. She<br/>
&#160;broke&#160;&#160;down completely and fainted. The shock of having her wickedness<br/>
&#160;brought home to&#160;&#160;her was too much for her. She literally died of fear.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong shook his head doubtfully.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It is a possible theory,&#34; he said. &#34;One cannot adopt it without more exact<br/>
&#160;&#160;knowledge of her state of health. If there was cardiac weakness-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said quietly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Call it, if you prefer, an Act of God.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Every one looked shocked. Mr. Blore said uneasily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's carrying things a bit far, Miss Brent.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She looked at them with shining eyes. Her chin went up. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You regard it as impossible that a sinner should be struck down<br/>
&#160;&#160;by the wrath of God! I do not!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge stroked his chin. He murmured in a slightly ironic voice:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=86></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My dear lady, in my experience of ill-doing, Providence leaves the work<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;conviction and chastisement to us mortals-and the process is often<br/>
&#160;fraught with&#160;&#160;difficulties. There are no short cuts.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent shrugged her shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What did she have to eat and drink I t i h f bed?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nothing. &#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She didn't take anything? A cup of tea? A drink of water? I'll bet you she<br/>
&#160;had&#160;&#160;a cup of tea. That sort always does.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;as n g<br/>
&#160; &#160;., L a Ler she went up to<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;i<br/>
&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=87></a>&#160;&#160;246&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Rogers assures me she had nothing whatsoever.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ah,&#34; said Blore. &#34;But he might say so!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His tone was so significant that the doctor looked at him sharply.&#160;&#160;Philip<br/>
&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So that's your idea?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said aggressively:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, why not? We all heard that accusation last night. May be sheer&#160;<br/>
&#160;moonshine-just plain lunacy! On the other hand, it may not. Allow for the<br/>
&#160;moment&#160;&#160;that it's true. Rogers and his missus polished off that old lady.<br/>
&#160;Well, where&#160;&#160;does that get you? They've been feeling quite safe and happy<br/>
&#160;about it-&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera interrupted. In a low voice she said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, I don't think Mrs. Rogers ever felt safe.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore looked slightly annoyed at the interruption. &#34;Just like a woman,&#34; his<br/>
&#160;&#160;glance said.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He resumed:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's as may be. Anyway there's no active danger to them as far as they<br/>
&#160;know.&#160;&#160;Then, last night, some unknown lunatic spills the beans. What<br/>
&#160;happens? The woman&#160;&#160;cracks-she goes to pieces. Notice how her husband hung<br/>
&#160;over her as she was coming&#160;&#160;round. Not all husbandly solicitude! Not on your<br/>
&#160;life! He was like a cat on hot&#160;&#160;bricks. Scared out of his life as to what<br/>
&#160;she might say.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And there's the position for you! They've done a murder and got away with<br/>
&#160;it.&#160;&#160;But if the whole thing's going to be raked up, what's going to happen?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=88></a>&#160;Ten to&#160;&#160;one, the woman will give the show away. She hasn't got the nerve to<br/>
&#160;stand up and&#160;&#160;brazen it out. She's a living danger to her husband, that's<br/>
&#160;what she is. He's all&#160;&#160;right. He'll lie with a straight face till kingdom<br/>
&#160;comes-but he can't be sure of&#160;&#160;her! And if she goes to pieces, his neck's<br/>
&#160;in danger! So he slips something into&#160;&#160;a cup of tea and makes sure that her<br/>
&#160;mouth is shut permanently.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There was no empty cup by her bedside-there was nothing there at all. I<br/>
&#160;looked.&#34;&#160;&#160;Blore snorted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course there wouldn't be! First thing he'd do when she'd drunk it would<br/>
&#160;be&#160;&#160;to take that cup and saucer away and wash it up carefully.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a pause. Then General Macarthur said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It may be so. But I should hardly think it possible that a man would do<br/>
&#160;that-to&#160;&#160;his wife.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore gave a short laugh.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;When a man's neck's in danger, he doesn't stop to think too much about&#160;<br/>
&#160;sentiment.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a pause. Before any one could speak, the door opened and Rogers<br/>
&#160;came&#160;&#160;in.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said, looking from one to the other:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Is there anything more I can get you? I'm sorry there was so little toast,<br/>
&#160;&#160;but we've run right out of bread. The new bread hasn't come over from the<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=89></a>&#160;&#160;mainland yet.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave stirred a little in his chair. He asked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What time does the motor boat usually come over?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Between seven and eight, Sir. Sometimes it's a bit after eight. Don't know<br/>
&#160;&#160;what Fred Narracott can be doing this morning. If he's ill he'd send his&#160;<br/>
&#160;brother.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's the time now?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ten minutes to ten, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard's eyebrows rose. He nodded slowly to himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers waited a minute or two.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur spoke suddenly and explosively.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Sorry to hear about your wife, Rogers. Doctor's just been telling&#160;US.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers inclined his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He took up the empty bacon dish and went out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Again there was a silence.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;On the terrace outside Philip Lombard said: &#34;About this motor boat-&#34; Blore<br/>
&#160;looked at him. Blore nodded his head. He said: &#34;I know what you're thinking,<br/>
&#160;Mr. Lombard. I've asked myself the same question. Motor boat ought to have<br/>
&#160;been&#160;here nigh on two hours ago. It hasn't come? Why?&#34; &#34;Found the answer?&#34;<br/>
&#160;asked&#160;Lombard.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=90></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I ~<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i I :<br/>

&#160;&#160;~ I<br/>
&#160;&#160;248&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's not an accident-tbat's what I say. It's part and parcel of the whole<br/>
&#160;&#160;business. It's all bound up together.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It won't come, you think?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A voice spoke behind him-a testy impatient voice.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The motor boat's not coming,&#34; he said.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore turned his square shoulder slightly and viewed the last speaker&#160;<br/>
&#160;thoughtfully.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You think not too, General?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course it won't come. We're counting on the motor boat to take us off<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;island. That's the meaning of the whole business. We're not going to<br/>
&#160;leave the&#160;&#160;island. . . . None of us will ever leave. . . . It's the end, you<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=91></a>&#160;see-the end of&#160;&#160;everything.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He hesitated, then he said in a low strange voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's peace-real peace. To come to the end-not to have to go on. . . .<br/>
&#160;Yes,&#160;&#160;peace. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He turned abruptly and walked away. Along the terrace, then down the slope<br/>
&#160;&#160;towards the sea-obliquely-to the end of the island where loose rocks went<br/>
&#160;out&#160;&#160;into the water.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He walked a little unsteadily, like a man who was only half awake. Blore<br/>
&#160;said:&#160;&#160;&#34;There goes another one who's balmy! Looks as though it'll end with<br/>
&#160;the whole lot&#160;&#160;going that way.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't fancy you will, Blore.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The ex-Inspector laughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It would take a lot to send me off my head.&#34; He added drily: &#34;And I don't<br/>
&#160;think&#160;&#160;you'll be going that way either, Mr. Lombard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I feel quite sane at the minute, thank you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong came out onto the terrace. He stood there hesitating. To his<br/>
&#160;&#160;left were Blore and Lombard. To his right was Wargrave, slowly pacing up and<br/>
&#160;&#160;down, his head bent down.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong, after a moment of indecision, turned towards the latter.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=92></a>&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;249<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But at that moment Rogers came quickly out of the house.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Could I have a word with you, sir, please?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong turned.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He was startled at what he saw.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers' face was working. Its colour was greyish green. His hands shook.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was such a contrast to his restraint of a few minutes ago that Armstrong<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;quite taken aback.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34; Please, sir, if I could have a word with you. Inside, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor turned back and re-entered the house with the frenzied butler.<br/>
&#160;He&#160;&#160;said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's the matter, man? Pull yourself together.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In here, sir, come in here.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He opened the dining-room door. The doctor passed in. Rogers followed him<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;shut the door behind him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well,&#34; said Armstrong, &#34;what is it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The muscles of Rogers' throat were working. He was swallowing. He jerked<br/>
&#160;out:&#160;&#34;There's things going on, sir, that I don't understand.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said sharply: &#34;Things? What things?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'll think I'm crazy, sir. You'll say it isn't anything. But it's got<br/>
&#160;to be&#160;&#160;explained, sir. It's got to be explained. Because it doesn't make any<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=93></a>&#160;sense.&#34;&#160;&#34;Well, man, tell me what it is? Don't go on talking in riddles.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers swallowed again.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's those little figures, sir. In the middle of the table. The little<br/>
&#160;china&#160;&#160;figures. Ten of them, there were. I'll swear to that, ten of them.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, ten. We counted them last night at dinner.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers came nearer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's just it, sir. Last night, when I was clearing up, there wasn't but<br/>
&#160;nine,&#160;&#160;sir. I noticed it and thought it queer. But that's all I thought. And<br/>
&#160;now, sir,&#160;&#160;this morning. I didn't notice when I laid the breakfast. I was<br/>
&#160;upset and all&#160;&#160;that.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But now, sir, when I came to clear away. See for yourself if you don't<br/>
&#160;believe&#160;&#160;me.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's only eight, sir! Only eight! It doesn't make sense, does it? Only<br/>
&#160;eight.&#160;&#160;. . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 7<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AftER BREAKFAST, Emily Brent had suggested to Vera Claythome that they<br/>
&#160;should walk&#160;up to the summit again and watch for the boat. Vera had<br/>
&#160;acquiesced.&#160;&#160;The wind had freshened. Small white crests were appearing on<br/>
&#160;the sea. There were&#160;&#160;Do fishing boats out-and no sign of the motor boat.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The actual village of Sticklehaven could not be seen, only the hill above<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=94></a>&#160;it, a&#160;&#160;jutting out cliff of red rock concealed the actual little bay.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The man who brought us out yesterday seemed a dependable sort of person.<br/>
&#160;It is&#160;&#160;really very odd that he should be so late this morning.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera did not answer. She was fighting down a rising feeling of panic.&#160;&#160;She<br/>
&#160;said to herself angrily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You must keep cool. This isn't like you. You've always had excellent<br/>
&#160;nerves.&#34;&#160;&#160;Aloud she said after a minute or two:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I wish he would come. I-I want to get away.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said drily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've no doubt we all do.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's all so extraordinary. all.))<br/>
&#160;&#160;The elderly woman beside her said briskly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm very annoyed with myself for being so easily taken in. Really that<br/>
&#160;letter&#160;&#160;is absurd when one comes to examine it. But I had no doubts at the<br/>
&#160;time-none at&#160;&#160;all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera murmured mechanically:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I suppose not.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One takes things for granted too much,&#34; said Emily Brent.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera drew a deep shuddering breath.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do you really think-what you said at breakfast?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Be a little more precise, my dear. To what in particular are you<br/>
&#160;referring?&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera said in a low voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=95></a>&#160;&#160;. . There seems no-no meaning in it<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do you really think that Rogers and his wife did away with that old lady?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent gazed thoughtfully out to sea. Then she said: &#34;Personally, I am<br/>
&#160;&#160;quite sure of it. What do you think?&#34; &#34;I don't know what to think.&#34; Emily<br/>
&#160;&#160;Brent said: &#34;Everything goes to support the idea. The way the woman fainted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And the man dropped the coffee tray, remember. Then the way he spoke about<br/>
&#160;&#160;it-it didn't ring true. Oh, yes, I'm afraid they did it.&#34; Vera said: &#34;The<br/>
&#160;way&#160;&#160;she looked-scared of her own shadow! I've never seen a woman look so<br/>
&#160;&#160;frightened. by it . . . . 11 Miss Brent murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. . She must have been always haunted<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I remember a text that hung in my nursery as a child. 'Be sure thy sin<br/>
&#160;will find&#160;&#160;thee out.' It's very true, that. 'Be sure thy sin will find thee<br/>
&#160;out.&#34;'&#160;&#160;Vera scrambled to her feet. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But, Miss Brent-Miss Brent-in that case-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, my dear?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The others? What about the others?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't quite understand you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;All the other accusations-they-they weren't true? But if it's true about<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;Rogerses-&#34; She stopped, unable to make her chaotic thought clear.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent's brow, which had been frowning perplexedly, cleared.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ali, I understand you now. Well, there is that Mr. Lombard. He admits to<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=96></a>&#160;having&#160;&#160;abandoned twenty men to their deaths.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;They were only natives. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Black or white, they are our brothers.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Our black brothers-our black brothers. Oh, I'm going to laugh. I'm<br/>
&#160;hysterical.&#160;&#160;I'm not myself. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent continued thoughtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course, some of the other accusations were very far-fetched and<br/>
&#160;ridiculous.&#160;&#160;Against the judge, for instance, who was only doing<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;his duty in his public capacity. And the ex-Scotland Yard man. My own case,<br/>
&#160;too.&#34;&#160;&#160;She paused and then went on:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Naturally, considering the circumstances, I was not going to say anything<br/>
&#160;last&#160;&#160;night. It was not a fit subject to discuss before gentlemen. &#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera listened with interest. Miss Brent continued serenely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Beatrice Taylor was in service with me. Not a nice girl-as I found out too<br/>
&#160;late.&#160;&#160;I was very much deceived in her. She had nice manners and was very<br/>
&#160;clean and&#160;&#160;willing. I was very pleased with her. Of course all that was the<br/>
&#160;sheerest&#160;&#160;hypocrisy! She was a loose girl with no morals. Disgusting! It was<br/>
&#160;some time&#160;&#160;before I found out that she was what they call 'in trouble.&#34;' She<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=97></a>&#160;paused, her&#160;&#160;delicate nose wrinkling itself in distaste. &#34;It was a great<br/>
&#160;shock to me. Her&#160;&#160;parents were decent folk, too, who had brought her up very<br/>
&#160;strictly. I'm glad to&#160;&#160;say they did not condone her behaviour.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said, staring at Miss Brent:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What happened?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Naturally I did not keep her an hour under my roof. No one shall ever say<br/>
&#160;that&#160;&#160;I condoned immorality.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said in a lower voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What happened-to her?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The abandoned creature, not content with having one sin on her conscience,<br/>
&#160;&#160;committed a still graver sin. She took her own life.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera whispered, horror-struck:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She killed herself?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, she threw herself into the river.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera shivered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She stared at the calm delicate profile of Miss Brent. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What did you feel like when you knew she'd done that? Weren't you sorry?<br/>
&#160;Didn't&#160;&#160;you blame yourself?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent drew herself up.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I? I had nothing with which to reproach myself.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But if your-hardness-drove her to<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Her own action-her own sin-that was what drove her to it. If she had<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=98></a>&#160;behaved&#160;&#160;like a decent modest young woman none of this would have happened.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;it.1)<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;253<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She turned her face to Vera. There was no self-reproach, no uneasiness in<br/>
&#160;&#160;those eyes. They were hard and self-righteous. Emily Brent sat on the summit<br/>
&#160;&#160;of Indian Island, encased in her own armour of virtue. The little elderly<br/>
&#160;&#160;spinster was no longer slightly ridiculous to Vera. Suddenly-she was<br/>
&#160;terrible.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong came out of the dining-room and once more came out on the<br/>
&#160;terrace.&#160;&#160;The judge was sitting in a chair now, gazing placidly out to sea.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard and Blore were over to the left, smoking but not talking. As before,<br/>
&#160;the&#160;doctor hesitated for a moment. His eye rested speculatively on Mr.<br/>
&#160;Justice&#160;Wargrave. He wanted to consult with some one. He was conscious of<br/>
&#160;the judge's&#160;acute logical brain. But nevertheless he wavered. Mr. Justice<br/>
&#160;Wargrave might have&#160;a good brain but he was an elderly man. At this<br/>
&#160;juncture, Armstrong felt what was&#160;needed was a man of action.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He made up his mind.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Lombard, can I speak to you for a minute?&#34; Philip started.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=99></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The two men left the terrace. They strolled down the slope towards the<br/>
&#160;water.&#160;&#160;When they were out of earshot, Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I want a consultation.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard's eyebrows went up. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My dear fellow, I've no medical knowledge.&#34; &#34;No, no, I mean as to the<br/>
&#160;general&#160;&#160;situation.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, that's different.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Frankly, what do you think of the position?&#34; Lombard reflected a minute.<br/>
&#160;Then&#160;&#160;he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's rather suggestive, isn't it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What are your ideas on the subject of that woman? Do you accept Blore's<br/>
&#160;theory?&#34;&#160;&#160;Philip puffed smoke into the air. He said: &#34;It's perfectly<br/>
&#160;feasible-taken alone.&#34;&#160;&#160;&#34;Exactly.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;254<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong's tone sounded relieved. Philip Lombard was no fool. 'Me<br/>
&#160;latterwent on:&#160;&#160;&#34;That is, accepting the premise that Mr. and Mrs. Rogers<br/>
&#160;have successfully got&#160;&#160;away with murder in their time. And I don't see why<br/>
&#160;they shouldn't. What do you&#160;&#160;think they did exactly? Poisoned the old lady?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It might be simpler than that. I asked Rogers this morning what this Miss<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=100></a>&#160;Brady&#160;&#160;had suffered from. His answer was enlightening. I don't need to go<br/>
&#160;into medical&#160;&#160;details, but in a certain form of cardiac trouble, amyl<br/>
&#160;nitrite is used. When an&#160;&#160;attack comes on an ampoule of amyl nitrite is<br/>
&#160;broken and it is inhaled. If amyl&#160;&#160;nitrite were withheldwell, the<br/>
&#160;consequences might easily be fatal.&#34;&#160;Philip Lombard said thoughtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;As simple as that. It must have been-rather tempting.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, no positive action. No arsenic to obtain and administernothing&#160;<br/>
&#160;definite-just-negation! And Rogers hurried through the night to fetch a<br/>
&#160;doctor&#160;&#160;and they both felt confident that no one could ever know.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And, even if any one knew, nothing could ever be proved against them,&#34;<br/>
&#160;added&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He frowned suddenly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course-that explains a good deal.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said, puzzled:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I beg your pardon.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I mean-it explains Indian Island. There are crimes that cannot be brought<br/>
&#160;home&#160;&#160;to their perpetrators. Instance, the Rogerses'. Another instance, old<br/>
&#160;Wargrave,&#160;&#160;who committed his murder strictly within the law.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You believe that story?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard smiled.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, yes, I believe it. Wargrave murdered Edward Seton all right, murdered<br/>
&#160;him&#160;&#160;as surely as if he'd stuck a stiletto through him! But he was clever<br/>
&#160;enough to&#160;&#160;do it from the judge's seat in wig and gown. So in the ordinary<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=101></a>&#160;way you can't&#160;&#160;bring his little crime home to him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A sudden flash passed like lightning through Armstrong's mind.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Murder in Hospital. Murder on the Operating Table. Safe-yes, safe as<br/>
&#160;houses!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;a<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard was saying:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Hence-Mr. Owen-hence-Indian Island!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong drew a deep breath.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now we're getting down to it. What's the real purpose of getting us all<br/>
&#160;here?&#34;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What do you think?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said abruptly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Let's go back a minute to this woman's death. What are the possible<br/>
&#160;theories?&#160;&#160;Rogers killed her because he was afraid she would give the show<br/>
&#160;away. Second&#160;&#160;possibility: She lost her nerve and took an easy way out<br/>
&#160;herself.&#34;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Suicide, eh?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What do you say to that?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=102></a>&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It could have been-yes-if it hadn't been for Marston's death. Two suicides<br/>
&#160;&#160;within twelve hours is a little too much to swallow! And if you tell me that<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston, a young bull with no nerves and precious little brains, got<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;wind up over having mowed down a couple of kids and deliberately put<br/>
&#160;himself out&#160;&#160;of the way-well, the idea's laughable! And anyway, how did he<br/>
&#160;get hold of the&#160;&#160;stuff? From all I've ever heard, Potassium Cyanide isn't<br/>
&#160;the kind of stuff you&#160;&#160;take about with you in your waistcoat pocket. But<br/>
&#160;that's your line of country.&#34;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nobody in their senses carries Potassium Cyanide. It might be done by some<br/>
&#160;one&#160;&#160;who was going to take a wasps' nest.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The ardent gardener or landowner, in fact? Again, not Anthony Marston. It<br/>
&#160;&#160;strikes me that Cyanide is going to need a bit of explaining. Either Anthony<br/>
&#160;&#160;Marston meant to do away with himself before he came here, and therefore<br/>
&#160;came&#160;&#160;prepared-or else-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong prompted him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Or else?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard grinned.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why make me say it? When it's on the tip of your own tongue. Anthony<br/>
&#160;Marston was&#160;&#160;murdered, of course.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OP MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong drew a deep breath.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And Mrs. Rogers?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=103></a>&#160;&#160;Lombard said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I could believe in Anthony's suicide (with difficulty) if it weren't for<br/>
&#160;Mrs.&#160;&#160;Rogers. I could believe in Mrs. Rogers' suicide (easily) if it weren't<br/>
&#160;for&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston. I can believe that Rogers put his wife out of the way-<br/>
&#160;if it were&#160;&#160;not for the unexplained death of Anthony Marston. But what we<br/>
&#160;need is a theory&#160;&#160;to explain two deaths following rapidly on each other.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I can perhaps give you some help towards that theory.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And he repeated the facts that Rogers had given hiin about the<br/>
&#160;disappearance of&#160;&#160;the two little china figures.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, little china Indian figures. . . . There were certainly ten last<br/>
&#160;night at&#160;&#160;dinner. And now there are eight, you say?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong recited:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ten little Indian boys going out to dine;<br/>
&#160;&#160;One went and choked himself and then there were nine.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;<br/>
&#160;&#160;One overslept himself and then there were eight.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The two men looked at each other. Philip Lombard grinned and flung away his<br/>
&#160;&#160;cigarette.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Fits too damned well to be a coincidence! Anthony Marston dies of<br/>
&#160;asphyxiation&#160;&#160;or choking last night after dinner, and Mother Rogers<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=104></a>&#160;oversleeps herself with a&#160;&#160;vengeance.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And therefore?&#34; said Armstrong.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard took him up.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And therefore another kind of puzzle. The Nigger in the Woodpile! X! Mr.<br/>
&#160;Owen!&#160;&#160;U. N. Owen. One Unknown Lunatic at Large!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ah!&#34; Armstrong breathed a sigh of relief. &#34;You agree. But you see what it<br/>
&#160;&#160;involves? Rogers swore that there was no one but ourselves and he and his<br/>
&#160;wife&#160;&#160;on the island.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;257<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Rogers is wrong! Or possibly Rogers is lying!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong shook his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't think he's lying. The man's scared. He's scared nearly out of his<br/>
&#160;&#160;senses.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No motor boat this morning. That fits in. Mr. Owen's little arrangements<br/>
&#160;&#160;again to the fore. Indian Island is to be isolated until Mr. Owen has<br/>
&#160;finished&#160;&#160;his job.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong had gone pale. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You realize-the man must be a raving maniac!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said, and there was a new ring in his voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's one thing Mr. Owen didn't realize.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=105></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;What's that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;This island's more or less a bare rock. We shaH make short work of<br/>
&#160;searching&#160;&#160;it. We'll soon ferret out U. N. Owen, Esq.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said warningly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He'll be dangerous.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard laughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Dangerous? Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? I'll be dangerous when I get<br/>
&#160;&#160;hold of him!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused and said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We'd better rope in Blore to help us. He'll be a good man in a pinch.<br/>
&#160;Better&#160;&#160;not tell the women. As for the others, the General's ga ga, I think,<br/>
&#160;and old&#160;&#160;Wargrave's forte is masterly inactivity. The three of us can attend<br/>
&#160;to this&#160;&#160;job.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 8<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;BLORE WAS easily roped in. He expressed immediate agreement with their<br/>
&#160;arguments.&#160;&#160;&#34;What you've said about those china figures, sir, makes all the<br/>
&#160;difference.&#160;&#160;That's crazy, that is! There's only one thing. You don't think<br/>
&#160;this Owen's idea&#160;&#160;might be to do the job by proxy, as it were?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Explain yourself, man.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, I mean like this. After the racket last night this young Mr. Marston<br/>
&#160;gets&#160;&#160;the wind up and poisons himself. And Rogers, he gets<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=106></a>&#160;&#160;258&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;AND THEN THERE<br/>
&#160;WERE&#160;NONE&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;259<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;the wind up too and bumps off his wife! All according to U. N. O.'s plan.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong shook his head. He stressed the point about the Cyanide. Blore<br/>
&#160;agreed.&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I'd forgotten that. Not a natural thing to be carrying about<br/>
&#160;With you. But&#160;&#160;how did it get into his drink, sir?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've been thinking about that. Marston had several drinks that night.<br/>
&#160;Between&#160;&#160;the time he had his last one and the time he finished the one<br/>
&#160;before it, there&#160;&#160;was quite a gap. During that time his glass was lying<br/>
&#160;about on some table or&#160;&#160;other. I think-though I can't be sure, it was on the<br/>
&#160;little table near the&#160;&#160;window. The window was open. Somebody could have<br/>
&#160;slipped a dose of the Cyanide&#160;&#160;into the glass.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said unbelievingly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Without our all seeing him, sir?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said drily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We were all-rather concerned elsewhere.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's true. We'd all been attacked. We were walking about, moving about<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;room. Arguing, indignant, intent on our own business. I think it could<br/>
&#160;have been&#160;&#160;done.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Fact is, it must have been done! Now then, gentlemen, let's make a start.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Nobody's got a revolver, by any chance? I suppose that's too much to hope<br/>
&#160;for.&#34;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=107></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I've got one.&#34; He patted his pocket.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore's eyes opened very wide. He said in an over-casual tone:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Always carry that about with you, sir?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Usually. I've been in some tight places, you know.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh,&#34; said Blore and added: &#34;Well, you've probably never been in a tighter<br/>
&#160;place&#160;&#160;than you are to-day! If there's a lunatic hiding on this island, he's<br/>
&#160;probably&#160;&#160;got a young arsenal on him-to say nothing of a knife or dagger or<br/>
&#160;two.&#34;&#160;Armstrong coughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You may be wrong there, Blore. Many homicidal lunatics are very quiet,&#160;<br/>
&#160;unassuming people. Delightful fellows.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't feel this one is going to be of that kind, Dr. Armstrong.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The three men started on their tour of the island.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It proved unexpectedly simple. On the northwest side, towards the coast,<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;cliffs f ell sheer to the sea below, their surface unbroken.<br/>
&#160;&#160;On the rest of the island there were no trees and very little cover. The<br/>
&#160;three&#160;&#160;men worked carefully and methodically, beating up and down from the<br/>
&#160;highest point&#160;&#160;to the water's edge, narrowly scanning the least irregularity<br/>
&#160;in the rock which&#160;&#160;might point to the entrance to a cave. But there were no<br/>
&#160;caves.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They came at last, skirting the water's edge, to where General Macarthur<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=108></a>&#160;sat&#160;&#160;looking out to sea. It was very peaceful here with the lap of the waves<br/>
&#160;breaking&#160;&#160;over the rocks. The old man sat very upright, his eyes fixed on<br/>
&#160;the horizon.&#160;&#160;He paid no attention to the approach of the searchers. His<br/>
&#160;oblivion of them made&#160;&#160;one at least faintly uncomfortable.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore thought to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;'Tisn't natural-looks as though he'd gone into a trance or something.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;He cleared his throat and said in a would-be conversational tone:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nice peaceful spot you've found for yourself, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The General frowned. He cast a quick look over his shoulder. He said:&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;There is so little time-so little time. I really must insist that no one&#160;<br/>
&#160;disturbs me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said genially:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We won't disturb you. We're just making a tour of the island, so to speak.<br/>
&#160;Just&#160;&#160;wondered, you know, if some one might be hiding on it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The General frowned and said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You don't understand-you don't understand at all. Please go away.&#34;&#160;Blore<br/>
&#160;retreated. He said, as he joined the other two:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He's crazy. . . . It's no good talking to him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard asked with some curiosity:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What did he say?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;260&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Something about there being no time and that he didn't want to be<br/>
&#160;disturbed.&#34;&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong frowned. He murmured: &#34;I wonder now.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=109></a>&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The search of the island was practically completed. The three men stood on<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;&#160;highest point looking over towards the mainland. There were no boats<br/>
&#160;out. The&#160;&#160;wind was freshening. Lombard said: &#34;No fishing boats out. There's<br/>
&#160;a storm&#160;&#160;coming. Damned nuisance you can't see the village from here. We<br/>
&#160;could signal&#160;&#160;or do something.&#34; Blore said: &#34;We might light a bonfire to-<br/>
&#160;night.&#34; Lombard&#160;&#160;said, frowning: &#34;The devil of it is that that's all<br/>
&#160;probably been provided&#160;&#160;for.&#34; &#34;In what way, sir?&#34; &#34;How do I know? Practical<br/>
&#160;joke, perhaps. We're to be&#160;&#160;marooned here, no attention is to be paid to<br/>
&#160;signals, etc. Possibly the&#160;&#160;village has been told there's a wager on. Some<br/>
&#160;damn fool story anyway.&#34; Blore&#160;&#160;said dubiously: &#34;Think they'd swallow that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;Lombard said drily: &#34;It's easier&#160;&#160;of belief than the truth! If the village<br/>
&#160;were told that the island was to be&#160;&#160;isolated until Mr. Unknown Owen had<br/>
&#160;quietly murdered all his guests-do you&#160;&#160;think they'd believe that?&#34; Dr.<br/>
&#160;Armstrong said: &#34;There are moments when I&#160;&#160;can't believe it myself. And yet-<br/>
&#160;&#34; Philip Lombard, his lips curling back from&#160;&#160;his teeth, said: &#34;And yet-<br/>
&#160;that's just it! You've said it, doctor!&#34; Blore was&#160;&#160;gazing down into the<br/>
&#160;water. He said: &#34;Nobody could have clambered down here, I&#160;&#160;suppose?&#34;<br/>
&#160;Armstrong shook his head. &#34;I doubt it. It's pretty sheer. And where&#160;&#160;could<br/>
&#160;he hide?&#34; Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;261<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There might be a hole in the cliff. If we had a boat now, we could row<br/>
&#160;round&#160;&#160;the island.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If we had a boat, we'd all be halfway to the mainland by now!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;True enough, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said suddenly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We can make sure of this cliff. There's only one place where there could<br/>
&#160;be a&#160;&#160;recess-just a little to the right below here. If you fellows can get<br/>
&#160;hold of a&#160;&#160;rope, you can let me down to make sure.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Might as well be sure. Though it seems absurd-on the face of it! I'll see<br/>
&#160;if&#160;&#160;I can get hold of something.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He started off briskly down to the house.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard stared up at the sky. The clouds were beginning to mass themselves<br/>
&#160;&#160;together. The wind was increasing.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He shot a sideways look at Armstrong. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're very silent, doctor. What are you thinking?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was wondering exactly how mad old Macarthur was.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;11<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera had been restless all the morning. She had avoided Emily Brent with<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=111></a>&#160;a kind&#160;&#160;of shuddering aversion.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent herself had taken a chair just round the corner of the house so<br/>
&#160;as to&#160;&#160;be out of the wind. She sat there knitting.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Every time Vera thought of her she seemed to see a pale drowned face with<br/>
&#160;seaweed&#160;&#160;entangled in the hair. . . . A face that had once been pretty-<br/>
&#160;impudently pretty&#160;&#160;perhaps-and which was now beyond the reach of pity or<br/>
&#160;terror.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And Emily Brent, placid and righteous, sat knitting.<br/>
&#160;&#160;On the main terrace, Mr. Justice Wargrave sat huddled in a porter's chair.<br/>
&#160;His&#160;&#160;head was poked down well into his neck.<br/>
&#160;&#160;When Vera looked at him, she saw a man standing in the dock-a young man<br/>
&#160;with fair&#160;&#160;hair and blue eyes and a bewildered, frightened face. Edward<br/>
&#160;Seton. And in&#160;&#160;imagination she saw the judge's old hands put the black cap<br/>
&#160;on his head and begin&#160;&#160;to pronounce sentence. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;After a while Vera strolled slowly down to the sea. She walked<br/>
&#160;&#160;262&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;along towards the extreme end of the island where an old man sat staring out<br/>
&#160;to&#160;the horizon.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur stirred at her approach. His head turned-there was a<br/>
&#160;queer&#160;&#160;mixture of questioning and apprehension in his look. It startled her.<br/>
&#160;He stared&#160;&#160;intently at her for a minute or two.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She thought to herself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;How queer. It's almost as though he knew<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=112></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Ah! it's you! You've come.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera sat down beside him. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do you like sitting here looking out to sea?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He nodded his head gently.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes,&#34; he said. &#34;It's pleasant. It's a good place, I think, to wait.&#34;&#160;&#34;To<br/>
&#160;wait?&#34; said Vera sharply. &#34;What are you waiting for?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said gently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The end. But I think you know that, don't you? It's true, isn't it? We're<br/>
&#160;all&#160;&#160;waiting for the end.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said unsteadily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What do you mean?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur said gravely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;None of us are going to leave the island. That's the plan. You know it,<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;course, perfectly. What, perhaps, you can't understand is the relief!&#34;<br/>
&#160;Vera said wonderingly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The relief?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes. Of course, you're very young . . . you haven't got to that yet. But<br/>
&#160;it does&#160;&#160;come! The blessed relief when you know that you've done with it<br/>
&#160;all-that you&#160;&#160;haven't got to carry the burden any longer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160; &#160;51<br/>
&#160;&#160;. ..<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;You'll feel that too some day.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said hoarsely:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=113></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't understand you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her fingers worked spasmodically. She felt suddenly afraid of this quiet<br/>
&#160;old&#160;&#160;soldier.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said musingly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You see, I loved Leslie. I loved her very much.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said questioningly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Was Leslie your wife?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, my wife. . . . I loved her-and I was very proud of her. She was so<br/>
&#160;&#160;pretty-and so gay.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He was silent for a minute or two, then he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I loved Leslie. That's why I did it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You mean-&#34; and paused.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur nodded his head gently.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's not much good denying it now-not when we're all going to die. I sent<br/>
&#160;&#160;Richmond to his death. I suppose, in a way, it was murder. Curious. Murder-<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;I've always been such a law-abiding man! But it didn't seem like that<br/>
&#160;at the&#160;&#160;time. I had no regrets. 'Serves him damned well right!'-that's what<br/>
&#160;I thought.&#160;&#160;But afterwards-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;In a hard voice, Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, afterwards?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=114></a>&#160;&#160;He shook his head vaguely. He looked puzzled and a little distressed.&#160;&#160;&#34;I<br/>
&#160;don't know. I-don't know. It was all different, you see. I don't know if&#160;<br/>
&#160;Leslie ever guessed . . . I don't think so. But you see, I didn't know about<br/>
&#160;her&#160;&#160;any more. She'd gone far away where I couldn't reach her. And then she<br/>
&#160;died-and&#160;&#160;I was alone.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Alone-alone-&#34; and the echo of her voice came back to her from the rocks.<br/>
&#160;General Macarthur said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'll be glad, too, when the end comes.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera got up. She said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know what you mean!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I know, my child, I know.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You don't. You don't understand at all.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur looked out to sea again. He seemed unconscious of her<br/>
&#160;presence&#160;&#160;behind him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said very gently and softly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Leslie . . . T'<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;When Blore returned from the house with a rope coiled over his arm, he<br/>
&#160;found&#160;&#160;Armstrong where he had left him staring down into the depths.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said breathlessly:<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Where's Mr. Lombard?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said carelessly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Gone to test some theory or other. He'll be back in a minute. Look here,<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore, I'm worried.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I should say we were all worried.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor waved an impatient hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course-of course. I don't mean it that way. I'm thinking of old&#160;<br/>
&#160;Macarthur.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What about him, Sir?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said grimly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What we're looking for is a madman. What price Macarthur?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said incredulously:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You mean he's homicidal?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I shouldn't have said so. Not for a minute. But of course I'm not a&#160;<br/>
&#160;specialist in mental diseases. I haven't really had any conversation with&#160;<br/>
&#160;him-I haven't studied him from that point of view.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ga ga, yes! But I wouldn't have said-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong cut in with a slight effort as of a man who pulls himself<br/>
&#160;together.&#160;&#160;&#34;You're probably right! Damn it all, there must be some one<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=116></a>&#160;hiding on the&#160;&#160;island. Ah! here comes Lombard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They fastened the rope carefully.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll help myself all I can. Keep a lookout for a sudden strain on the<br/>
&#160;rope.&#34;&#160;&#160;After a minute or two, while they stood together watching Lombard's<br/>
&#160;progress,&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Climbs like a cat, doesn't he?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was something odd in his voice.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I should think he must have done some mountaineering in his time.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#34;Maybe.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a silence and the ex-Inspector said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Funny sort of cove altogether. D'you know what I think?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He's a wrong 'un!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In what way?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;265<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore grunted. Then he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know-exactly. But I wouldn't trust him a yard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I suppose he's led an adventurous life.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=117></a>&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I bet some of his adventures have had to be kept pretty dark.&#34; He paused<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;then went on: &#34;Did you happen to bring a revolver along with you,<br/>
&#160;doctor?&#34;&#160;Armstrong stared.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Me? Good Lord, no. Why should IT'<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why did Mr. Lombard?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I suppose-habit.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore snorted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;A sudden pull came on the rope. For some moments they had their hands full.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Presently, when the strain relaxed, Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There are habits and habits! Mr. Lombard takes a revolver to out-of-the-<br/>
&#160;way&#160;&#160;places, right enough, and a primus and a sleeping-bag and a supply of<br/>
&#160;bug powder,&#160;&#160;no doubt! But habit wouldn't make him bring the whole outfit<br/>
&#160;down here? It's only&#160;&#160;in books people carry revolvers around as a matter of<br/>
&#160;course.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong shook his head perplexedly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They leaned over and watched Lombard's progress. His search was thorough<br/>
&#160;and they&#160;&#160;could see at once that it was futile. Presently he came up over<br/>
&#160;the edge of the&#160;&#160;cliff. He wiped the perspiration from his forehead.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well,&#34; he said. &#34;We're up against it. It's the house or nowhere.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;6<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=118></a>&#160;&#160;The house was easily searched. They went through the few outbuildings first<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;then turned their attention to the building itself. Mrs. Rogers' yard<br/>
&#160;measure&#160;&#160;discovered in the kitchen dresser assisted them. But there were no<br/>
&#160;hidden spaces&#160;&#160;left unaccounted for. Everything was plain and<br/>
&#160;straightforward, a modern&#160;&#160;structure devoid of concealments. They went<br/>
&#160;through the ground floor first. As&#160;&#160;they mounted to the bedroom floor, they<br/>
&#160;saw through the landing window Rogers&#160;&#160;carrying out a tray of cocktails to<br/>
&#160;the terrace.<br/>

&#160;&#160;266&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said lightly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Wonderful animal, the good servant. Carries on with an impassive<br/>
&#160;countenance.&#34;&#160;Armstrong said appreciatively:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Rogers is a first-class butler, I'll say that for him!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;His wife was a pretty good cook, too. That dinner-last night-&#34; They turned<br/>
&#160;in&#160;&#160;to the first bedroom.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Five minutes later they faced each other on the landing. No one hiding-no<br/>
&#160;&#160;possible hiding-place.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's a little stair here.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=119></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;It leads up to the servants' room.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There must be a place under the roof-for cisterns, water tank, etc. It's<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;best chance-and the only one!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And it was then, as they stood there, that they heard the sound from above.<br/>
&#160;A&#160;&#160;soft furtive footfall overhead.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They all heard it. Armstrong grasped Blore's arm. Lombard held up an<br/>
&#160;admonitory&#160;&#160;finger.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Quiet-listen.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;It came again-some one moving softly, furtively, overhead.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong whispered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He's actually in the bedroom itself. The room where Mrs. Rogers' body is.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Blore whispered back:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course! Best hiding-place he could have chosen! Nobody likely to go<br/>
&#160;there.&#160;&#160;Now then-quiet as you can.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They crept stealthily upstairs.<br/>
&#160;&#160;On the little landing outside the door of the bedroom they paused again.<br/>
&#160;Yes,&#160;&#160;some one was in the room. There was a faint creak from within.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore whispered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He flung open the door and rushed in, the other two close behind him.&#160;Then<br/>
&#160;all three stopped dead.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers was in the room, his hands full of garments.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=120></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;7<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;267<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore recovered himself first. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Sorry-er-Rogers. Heard some one moving about in here, and thought-well-&#34;<br/>
&#160;He stopped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm sorry, gentlemen. I was just moving my things. I take it there will<br/>
&#160;be no&#160;&#160;objection if I take one of the vacant guest chambers on the floor<br/>
&#160;below? The&#160;&#160;smallest room.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was to Armstrong that he spoke, and Armstrong replied:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course. Of course. Get on with it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He avoided looking at the sheeted figure lying on the bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Thank you, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He went out of the room with his arm full of belongings and went down the<br/>
&#160;stairs&#160;&#160;to the floor below.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong moved over to the bed and, lifting the sheet, looked down on the<br/>
&#160;&#160;peaceful face of the dead woman. There was no fear there now. Just<br/>
&#160;emptiness.&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Wish I'd got my stuff here. I'd like to know what drug it was.'<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then he turned to the other two.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Let's get finished. I feel it in my bones we're not going to find<br/>
&#160;anything.&#34;&#160;Blore was wrestling with the bolts of a low manhole.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=121></a>&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That chap moves damned quietly. A minute or two ago we saw him in the<br/>
&#160;garden.&#160;&#160;None of us heard him come upstairs.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I suppose that's why we assumed it must be a stranger moving about up<br/>
&#160;here.&#34;&#160;&#160;Blore disappeared into a cavernous darkness. Lombard pulled a torch<br/>
&#160;from his&#160;&#160;pocket and followed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Five minutes later three men stood on an upper landing and looked at each<br/>
&#160;other.&#160;&#160;They were dirty and festooned with cobwebs and their faces were<br/>
&#160;grim.&#160;There was no one on the island but their eight selves.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 9<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;LOMBARD SAM Slowly: . &#34;So we've been wrong-wrong all along! Built up a<br/>
&#160;nightmare of superstition and fantasy all because of the coincidence of two<br/>
&#160;deaths!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said gravely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And yet, you know, the argument holds. Hang it all, I'm a doctor, I know<br/>
&#160;&#160;something about suicides. Anthony Marston wasn't a suicidal type.&#34;&#160;Lombard<br/>
&#160;said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It couldn't, I suppose, have been an accident?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=122></a>&#160;&#160;Blore snorted, unconvinced.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Damned queer sort of accident,&#34; he grunted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a pause, then Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;About the woman-&#34; and stopped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Mrs. Rogers?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes. It's possible, isn't it, that that might have been an accident?&#34;<br/>
&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;An accident? In what way?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore looked slightly embarrassed. His red-brick face grew a little deeper<br/>
&#160;in&#160;&#160;hue. He said, almost blurting out the words:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here, doctor, you did give her some dope, you know.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong stared at him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Dope? What do you mean?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Last night. You said yourself you'd give her something to make her sleep.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#34;Oh, that, yes. A harmless sedative.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What was it exactly?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I gave her a mild dose of trional. A perfectly harmless preparation.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Blore grew redder still. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here-not to mince matters-you didn't give her an overdose, did you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;Dr. Armstrong said angrily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know what you mean.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=123></a>&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;. i<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's possible, isn't it, that you may have made a mistake? These things<br/>
&#160;do&#160;&#160;happen once in a while.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I did nothing of the sort. The suggestion is ridiculous.&#34; He stopped and<br/>
&#160;added&#160;&#160;in a cold biting tone: &#34;Or do you suggest that I gave her an overdose<br/>
&#160;on&#160;&#160;purpose?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here, you two, got to keep our heads. Don't let's start slinging&#160;<br/>
&#160;accusations about.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said sullenly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I only suggested the doctor had made a mistake.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong smiled with an effort. He said, showing his teeth in a<br/>
&#160;somewhat&#160;&#160;nidrthless smile:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Doctors can't afford to make mistakes of that kind, my friend.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said deliberately:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It wouldn't be the first you've made-if that gramophone record is to be<br/>
&#160;&#160;believed!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong went white. Philip Lombard said quickly and angrily to Blore:&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;What's the sense of making yourself offensive? We're all in the same boat.<br/>
&#160;We've&#160;&#160;got to pull together. What about your own pretty little spot of<br/>
&#160;perjury?&#34;&#160;&#160;Blore took a step forward, his hands clenched. He said in a thick<br/>
&#160;voice:&#160;&#160;&#34;Perjury be damned! That's a foul lie! You may try and shut me up,<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=124></a>&#160;Mr. Lombard,&#160;&#160;but there's things I want to know-and one of them is about<br/>
&#160;you!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard's eyebrows rose.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;About me?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes. I want to know why you brought a revolver down here on a pleasant<br/>
&#160;social&#160;&#160;visit?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You do, do you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I do, Mr. Lombard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said unexpectedly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You know, Blore, you're not nearly such a fool as you look.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's as may be. What about that revolver?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard smiled.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I brought it because I expected to run into a spot of trouble.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said suspiciously:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You didn't tell us that last night.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I ,<br/>

&#160;WERE NONE&#160;271<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=125></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard shook his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You were holding out on us?&#34; Blore persisted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In a way, yes,&#34; said Lombard.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, come on, out with it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I allowed you all to think that I was asked here in the same way as most<br/>
&#160;of the&#160;&#160;others. That's not quite true. As a matter of fact I was approached<br/>
&#160;by a little&#160;&#160;Jewboy-Morris his name was. He offered me a hundred guineas to<br/>
&#160;come down here and&#160;&#160;keep my eyes open-said I'd got a reputation for being<br/>
&#160;a good man in a tight&#160;&#160;place.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well?&#34; Blore prompted impatiently.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said with a grin:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's all.')<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But surely he told you more than that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, no, he didn't. Just shut up like a clam. I could take it or leave it-<br/>
&#160;those&#160;&#160;were his words. I was hard up. I took it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore looked unconvinced. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why didn't you tell us all this last night?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My dear man-&#34; Lombard shrugged eloquent shoulders. &#34;How was I to know that<br/>
&#160;last&#160;&#160;night wasn't exactly the eventuality I was here to cope with? I lay<br/>
&#160;low and told&#160;&#160;a noncommittal story.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said shrewdly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But now-you think differently?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=126></a>&#160;&#160;Lombard's face changed. It darkened and hardened. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes. I believe now that I'm in the same boat as the rest of you. That<br/>
&#160;hundred&#160;&#160;guineas was just Mr. Owen's little bit of cheese to get me into the<br/>
&#160;trap along&#160;&#160;with the rest of you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;For we are in a trap-I'll take my oath on that! Mrs. Rogers' death! Tony<br/>
&#160;&#160;Marston's! The disappearing Indian boys on the dinnertable! Oh, yes, Mr.<br/>
&#160;Owen's&#160;&#160;hand is plainly to be seen-but where the devil is Mr. Owen himself?&#34;<br/>
&#160;Downstairs the gong pealed a solemn call to lunch.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers was standing by the dining-room door. As the three men descended the<br/>
&#160;&#160;stairs he moved a step or two forward. He said in a low anxious voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I hope lunch will be satisfactory. There is cold ham and cold tongue, and<br/>
&#160;I've&#160;&#160;boiled some potatoes. And there's cheese and biscuits and some tinned<br/>
&#160;fruits.&#34;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Sounds all right. Stores are holding out, then?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There is plenty of food, sir-of a tinned variety. The larder is very well<br/>
&#160;&#160;stocked. A necessity, that, I should say, Sir, on an island where one may<br/>
&#160;be cut&#160;&#160;off from the mainland for a considerable period.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers murmured as he followed the three men into the diningroom:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It worries me that Fred Narracott hasn't been over to-day. It's peculiarly<br/>
&#160;&#160;unfortunate, as you might say.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=127></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Lombard, &#34;peculiarly unfortunate describes it very well.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Miss Brent came into the room. She had just dropped a ball of wool and was<br/>
&#160;&#160;carefully rewinding the end of it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As she took her seat at table she remarked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The weather is changing. The wind is quite strong and there are white<br/>
&#160;horses on&#160;&#160;the sea.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave came in. He walked with a slow measured tread. He<br/>
&#160;darted&#160;&#160;quick looks from under his bushy eyebrows at the other occupants of<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;dining-room. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You have had an active morning.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a faint malicious pleasure in his voice.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne hurried in. She was a little out of breath.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I hope you didn't wait for me. Am I late?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're not the last. The General isn't here yet.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They sat round the table.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers addressed Miss Brent:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Will you begin, Madam, or will you wait?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;General Macarthur is sitting right down by the sea. I don't expect he<br/>
&#160;would hear&#160;&#160;the gong there and anyway&#34;-she hesitated-&#34;he's a little vague<br/>
&#160;to-day, I think.&#34;&#160;Rogers said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I will go down and inform him luncheon is ready.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong jumped up.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=128></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll go,&#34; he said. &#34;You others start lunch.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;272&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He left the room. Behind him he heard Rogers'voice. &#34;Will you take cold<br/>
&#160;tongue&#160;or cold ham, Madam?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The five people sitting round the table seemed to find conversation<br/>
&#160;difficult.&#160;&#160;Outside sudden gusts of wind came up and died away.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera shivered a little and said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There is a storm coming.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore made a contribution to the discourse. He said conversationally:&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;There was an old fellow in the train from Plymouth yesterday. He kept saying<br/>
&#160;&#160;a storm was coming. Wonderful how they know weather, these old salts.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Rogers went round the table collecting the meat plates.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Suddenly, with the plates held in his hands, he stopped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said in an odd scared voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's somebody running. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They could all hear it-running feet along the terrace.<br/>
&#160;&#160;In that minute, they knew-knew without being told. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;As by common accord, they all rose to their feet. They stood looking<br/>
&#160;towards&#160;&#160;the door.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong appeared, his breath coming fast.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;General Macarthur-&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=129></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Dead!&#34; The word burst from Vera explosively.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, he's dead.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a pause-a long pause.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Seven people looked at each other and could find no words to say.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The storm broke just as the old man's body was borne in through the door.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The others were standing in the hall.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a sudden hiss and roar as the rain came down.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As Blore and Armstrong passed up the stairs with their burden,<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne turned suddenly and went into the deserted diningroom.&#160;&#160;It<br/>
&#160;was as they had left it. The sweet course stood ready on the sideboard&#160;<br/>
&#160;untasted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera went up to the table. She was there a minute or two later when Rogers<br/>
&#160;&#160;came softly into the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He started when he saw her. Then his eyes asked a question.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, Miss, 1-1 just came to see .<br/>
&#160;&#160;In a loud harsh voice that surprised herself Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're quite right, Rogers. Look for yourself. There are only seven . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=130></a>&#160;. .&#160;&#160;P)<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur had been laid on his bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;After making a last examination Armstrong left the room and came<br/>
&#160;downstairs. He&#160;&#160;found the others assembled in the drawingroom.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent was knitting. Vera Claythorne was standing by the window looking<br/>
&#160;out&#160;&#160;at the hissing rain. Blore was sitting squarely in a chair, his hands<br/>
&#160;on his&#160;&#160;knees. Lombard was walking restlessly up and down. At the far end<br/>
&#160;of the room Mr.&#160;&#160;Justice Wargrave was sitting in a grandfather chair. His<br/>
&#160;eyes were half closed.&#160;&#160;They opened as the doctor came into the room. He<br/>
&#160;said in a clear penetrating&#160;&#160;voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, doctor?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong was very pale. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No question of heart failure or anything like that. Macarthur was hit with<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;life preserver or some such thing on the back of the head.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A little murmur went round, but the clear voice of the judge was raised<br/>
&#160;once&#160;&#160;more.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Did you find the actual weapon used?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;'No.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nevertheless you are sure of your facts?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I am quite sure.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said quietly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We know now exactly where we are.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was no doubt now who was in charge of the situation. This morning<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=131></a>&#160;Wargrave&#160;&#160;had sat huddled in his chair on the terrace refrain-<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;276&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Unfortunately,&#34; he said, &#34;we are all in that position. There is only our<br/>
&#160;own&#160;&#160;word to go upon.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He leant forward.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You have none of you yet grasped what a very peculiar situation this is.<br/>
&#160;To my&#160;&#160;mind there is only one course of procedure to adopt. Is there any one<br/>
&#160;whom we can&#160;&#160;definitely eliminate from suspicion on 'the evidence which is<br/>
&#160;in our possession?&#34;&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I am a well-known professional man. The mere idea that I can be suspected<br/>
&#160;of-&#34;&#160;&#160;Again a gesture of the judge's hand arrested a speaker before he<br/>
&#160;finished his&#160;&#160;speech. Mr. Justice Wargrave said in his small clear voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I, too, am a well-known person! But, my dear Sir, that proves less than<br/>
&#160;nothing!&#160;&#160;Doctors have gone mad before now. Judges have gone mad. So,&#34; he<br/>
&#160;added, looking&#160;&#160;at Blore, &#34;have policemen!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;At any rate, I suppose you'll leave the women out of it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge's eyebrows rose. He said in the famous &#34;acid&#34; tone that Counsel<br/>
&#160;knew&#160;&#160;so well:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do I understand you to assert that women are not subject to homicidal<br/>
&#160;mania?&#34;&#160;&#160;Lombard said irritably:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course not. But all the same, it hardly seems possible-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He stopped. Mr. Justice Wargrave still in the same thin sour voice<br/>
&#160;addressed&#160;&#160;Armstrong.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=132></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I take it, Dr. Armstrong, that a woman would have been physically capable<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;striking the blow that killed poor Macarthur?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor said calmly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Perfectly capable-given a suitable instrument, such as a rubber truncheon<br/>
&#160;or&#160;&#160;cosh.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It would require no undue exertion of force?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not at all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave wriggled his tortoise-like neck. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The other two deaths have resulted from the administration of drugs. That,<br/>
&#160;no&#160;&#160;one will dispute, is easily compassed by a person of the smallest<br/>
&#160;physical&#160;&#160;strength.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried angrily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I think you're mad!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His eyes turned slowly till they rested on her. It was the dispassionate<br/>
&#160;stare&#160;&#160;of a man well used to weighing humanity in the balance. She thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;f t;<br/>
&#160;&#160;-1<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I i<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=133></a>&#160;&#160;i<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He's just seeing me as a-as a specimen. And&#34;-the thought came to her with<br/>
&#160;real&#160;&#160;surprise-&#34;he doesn't like me much!<br/>
&#160;&#160;In measured tones the judge was saying:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My dear young lady, do try and restrain your feelings. I am not accusing<br/>
&#160;you.&#34;&#160;&#160;He bowed to Miss Brent. &#34;I hope, Miss Brent, that you are not<br/>
&#160;offended by my&#160;&#160;insistence that all of us are equally under suspicion?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent was knitting. She did not look up. In a cold voice she said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The idea that I should be accused of taking a fellow creature's life-not<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;speak of the lives of three fellow creatures-is, of course, quite absurd<br/>
&#160;to any&#160;&#160;one who knows anything of my character. But I quite appreciate the<br/>
&#160;fact that we&#160;&#160;are all strangers to one another and that in those<br/>
&#160;circumstances, nobody can be&#160;&#160;exonerated without the fullest proof. There<br/>
&#160;is, as I have said, a devil amongst&#160;&#160;us.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Then we are agreed. There can be no elimination on the ground of character<br/>
&#160;or&#160;&#160;position alone.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What about Rogers?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=134></a>&#160;&#160;The judge looked at him unblinkingly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What about him?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, to my mind, Rogers seems pretty well ruled out.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Indeed, and on what grounds?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He hasn't got the brains for one thing. And for another his wife was one<br/>
&#160;of the&#160;&#160;victims.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge's heavy eyebrows rose once more. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In my time, young man, several people have come before me accused of the<br/>
&#160;murders&#160;&#160;of their wives-and have been found guilty.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh! I agree. Wife murder is perfectly possible-almost natural, let's say!<br/>
&#160;But&#160;&#160;not this particular kind! I can believe in Rogers killing his wife<br/>
&#160;because he was&#160;&#160;scared of her breaking down and giving him away, or because<br/>
&#160;he'd taken a dislike&#160;&#160;to her, or because he wanted to link up with some nice<br/>
&#160;little bit rather less&#160;&#160;long in the tooth. But I can't see him as the<br/>
&#160;lunatic Mr. Owen dealing out crazy&#160;&#160;justice and starting on his own wife for<br/>
&#160;a crime they both committed.&#34;&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You are assuming heresay to be evidence. We do not know that Rogers and<br/>
&#160;his wife&#160;&#160;conspired to murder their employer. That may<br/>
&#160;&#160;278&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;have been a false statement, made so that Rogers should appear to be in the<br/>
&#160;same&#160;position as ourselves. Mrs. Rogers' terror last night may have been due<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=135></a>&#160;to the&#160;fact that she realized her husband was mentally unhinged.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, have it your own way. U. N. Owen is one of us. No eiceptions<br/>
&#160;allowed. We&#160;&#160;all qualify.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My point is that there can be no exceptions allowed on the score of<br/>
&#160;character,&#160;&#160;position, or probability. What we must now examine is the<br/>
&#160;possibility of&#160;&#160;eliminating one or more persons on the facts. To put it<br/>
&#160;simply, is there among&#160;&#160;us one or more persons who could not possibly have<br/>
&#160;administered either Cyanide&#160;&#160;to Anthony Marston, or an overdose of sleeping<br/>
&#160;draught to Mrs. Rogers, and who&#160;&#160;had no opportunity of striking the blow<br/>
&#160;that killed General Macarthur?&#34;&#160;&#160;Blore's rather heavy face lit up. He leant<br/>
&#160;forward.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now you're talking, Sir!&#34; he said. &#34;That's the stuff! Let's go into it.<br/>
&#160;As&#160;&#160;regards young Marston I don't think there's anything to be done. It's<br/>
&#160;already&#160;&#160;been suggested that some one from outside slipped something into<br/>
&#160;the dregs of his&#160;&#160;glass before he refilled it for the last time. A person<br/>
&#160;actually in the room&#160;&#160;could have done that even more easily. I can't<br/>
&#160;remember if Rogers was in the&#160;&#160;room, but any of the rest of us could<br/>
&#160;certainly have done it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused, then went on.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now take the woman Rogers. The people who stand out there are her husband<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;the doctor. Either of them could have done it as easy as winking-&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Armstrong sprang to his feet. He was trembling.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I protest- This is absolutely uncalled for! I swear that the dose I gave<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;woman was perfectly-&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=136></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Dr. Armstrong.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The small sour voice was compelling. The doctor stopped with a jerk in the<br/>
&#160;middle&#160;&#160;of his sentence. The small cold voice went on.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Your indignation is very natural. Nevertheless you must admit that the<br/>
&#160;facts&#160;&#160;have got to be faced. Either you or Rogers could have administered<br/>
&#160;a fatal dose&#160;&#160;with the greatest ease. Let us now consider the position of<br/>
&#160;the other people&#160;&#160;present. What chance had 1, had Inspector Blore, had Miss<br/>
&#160;Brent, had Miss&#160;&#160;Claythorne, had Mr. Lombard of administering poison? Can<br/>
&#160;any one of us be&#160;&#160;completely and entirely eliminated?&#34; He paused. &#34;I think<br/>
&#160;not.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said angrily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was nowhere near the woman! All of you can swear to that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave waited a minute, then he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;As far as my memory serves me the facts were these-will any one please<br/>
&#160;correct&#160;&#160;me if I make a misstatement? Mrs. Rogers was lifted onto the sofa<br/>
&#160;by Anthony&#160;&#160;Marston and Mr. Lombard and Dr. Armstrong went to her. He sent<br/>
&#160;Rogers for brandy.&#160;&#160;There was then a question raised as to where the voice<br/>
&#160;we had just heard had come&#160;&#160;from. We all went into the next room with the<br/>
&#160;exception of Miss Brent who&#160;&#160;remained in this room-alone with the<br/>
&#160;unconscious woman.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A spot of colour came into Emily Brent's cheeks. She stopped knitting. She<br/>
&#160;said:&#160;&#160;&#34;This is outrageous!&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=137></a>&#160;&#160;The remorseless small voice went on.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;When we returned to this room, you, Miss Brent, were bending over the<br/>
&#160;woman on&#160;&#160;the sofa.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Is common humanity a criminal offence?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I am only establishing facts. Rogers then entered the room with the brandy<br/>
&#160;&#160;which, of course, he could quite well have doctored before entering the<br/>
&#160;room. The&#160;&#160;brandy was administered to the woman and shortly afterwards her<br/>
&#160;husband and Dr.&#160;&#160;Armstrong assisted her up to bed where Dr. Armstrong gave<br/>
&#160;her a sedative.&#34;&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's what happened. Absolutely. And that lets out the judge, Mr.<br/>
&#160;Lombard,&#160;&#160;myself and Miss Claythorne.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His voice was loud and jubilant. Mr. Justice Wargrave, bringing a cold eye<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;bear upon him, murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ah, but does it? We must take into account every possible eventuality.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore stared. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't get you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Upstairs in her room, Mrs. Rogers is lying in bed. The sedative that the<br/>
&#160;doctor&#160;&#160;has given her begins to take effect. She is vaguely sleepy and<br/>
&#160;acquiescent.&#160;&#160;Supposing that at that moment there is a tap on the door and<br/>
&#160;some one enters&#160;&#160;bringing her, shall we say, a tablet, or a draught, with<br/>
&#160;the message that 'the&#160;&#160;doctor says you're to take this.' Do you imagine for<br/>
&#160;one minute that she would&#160;&#160;not have swallowed it obediently without thinking<br/>
&#160;twice about it?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=138></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;280&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a silence. Blore shifted his feet and frowned. Philip Lombard<br/>
&#160;said:&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't believe in that story for a minute. Besides none of us left<br/>
&#160;this room&#160;&#160;for hours afterwards. There was Marston's death and all the rest<br/>
&#160;of it.&#34;&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Some one could have left his or her bedroom-later.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard objected:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But then Rogers would have been up there.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong stirred.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No,&#34; he said. &#34;Rogers went downstairs to clear up in the diningroom and<br/>
&#160;pantry.&#160;&#160;Any one could have gone up to the woman's bedroom then without<br/>
&#160;being seen.&#34;&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Surely, doctor, the woman would have been fast asleep by then under the<br/>
&#160;&#160;influence of the drug you had administered?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In all likelihood, yes. But it is not a certainty. Until you have pre-<br/>
&#160;scribed&#160;&#160;for a patient more than once you cannot tell their reaction to<br/>
&#160;different drugs.&#160;&#160;There is, sometimes, a considerable period before a<br/>
&#160;sedative takes effect. It&#160;&#160;depends on the personal idiosyncrasy of the<br/>
&#160;patient towards that particular&#160;&#160;drug.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course you would say that, doctor. Suits your book-eh?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Again Armstrong's face darkened with anger.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But again that passionless cold little voice stopped the words on his lips.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=139></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;No good result can come from recrimination. Facts are what we have to deal<br/>
&#160;with.&#160;&#160;It is established, I think, that there is a possibility of such a<br/>
&#160;thing as I have&#160;&#160;outlined occurring. I agree that its probability value is<br/>
&#160;not high; though there&#160;&#160;again, it depends on who that person might have<br/>
&#160;been. The appearance of Miss&#160;&#160;Brent or of Miss Claythorne on such an errand<br/>
&#160;would have occasioned no surprise&#160;&#160;in the patient's mind. I agree that the<br/>
&#160;appearance of myself, or of Mr. Blore,&#160;&#160;or of Mr. Lombard could have been,<br/>
&#160;to say the least of it, unusual, but I still&#160;&#160;think the visit would have<br/>
&#160;been received without the awakening of any real&#160;&#160;suspicion.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And that gets us-where?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;7<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave, stroking his Up and looking quite passionless and<br/>
&#160;inhuman,&#160;&#160;said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We have now dealt with the second killing, and have established the fact<br/>
&#160;that&#160;&#160;no one of us can be completely exonerated from suspicion.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused and went on.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We come now to the death of General Macarthur. That took place this<br/>
&#160;morning. I&#160;&#160;will ask any one who considers that he or she has an alibi to<br/>
&#160;state it in so many&#160;&#160;words. I myself will state at once that I have no valid<br/>
&#160;alibi. I spent the&#160;&#160;morning sitting on the terrace and meditating on the<br/>
&#160;singular position in which&#160;&#160;we all find ourselves.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=140></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I sat on that chair on the terrace for the whole morning until the gong<br/>
&#160;went,&#160;&#160;but there were, I should imagine, several periods during the morning<br/>
&#160;when I was&#160;&#160;quite unobserved and during which it would have been possible<br/>
&#160;for me to walk down&#160;&#160;to the sea, kill the General, and return to my chair.<br/>
&#160;There is only my word for&#160;&#160;the fact that I never left the terrace. In the<br/>
&#160;circumstances that is not enough.&#160;&#160;There must be proof.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was with Mr. Lombard and Dr. Armstrong all the morning. They'll bear me<br/>
&#160;out.&#34;&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You went to the house for a rope.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course, I did. Went straight there and straight back. You know I did.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You were a long time.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore turned crimson.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What the hell do you mean by that, Dr. Armstrong?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong repeated:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I only said you were a long time.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Had to find it, didn't I? Can't lay your hands on a coil of rope all in<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;minute.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;282&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;During Inspector Blore's absence, were you two gentlemen together?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=141></a>&#160;Armstrong said hotly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Certainly. That is, Lombard went off for a few minutes. I remained where<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;was.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said with a smile:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I wanted to test the possibilities of heliographing to the mainland.<br/>
&#160;Wanted&#160;&#160;to find the best spot. I was only absent a minute or two.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong nodded. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's right. Not long enough to do a murder, I assure you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Did either of you two glance at your watches?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, no.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I wasn't wearing one.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said evenly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A minute or two is a vague expression.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He turned his head to the upright figure with the knitting lying on her<br/>
&#160;lap.&#160;&#34;Miss Brent?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I took a walk with Miss Claythorne up to the top of the island. Afterwards<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;sat on the terrace in the sun.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't think I noticed you there.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, I was round the corner of the house to the east. It was out of the<br/>
&#160;wind&#160;&#160;there.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And you sat there till lunch time?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=142></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Miss Claythorne?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera answered readily and clearly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was with Miss Brent early this morning. After that I wandered about a<br/>
&#160;bit.&#160;&#160;Then I went down and talked to General Macarthur.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave interrupted. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What time was that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera for the first time was vague. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know. About an hour before lunch, I think-or it might have been<br/>
&#160;&#160;less.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore asked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Was it after we'd spoken to him or before?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;i<br/>
&#160;.1<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know. He-he was very queer.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She shivered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In what way was he queer?&#34; the judge wanted to know.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said in a low voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He said we were all going to die-he said he was waiting for the end. He-he<br/>
&#160;&#160;frightened me. . . .&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=143></a>&#160;&#160;The judge nodded. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What did you do next?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I went back to the house. Then, just before lunch, I went out again and<br/>
&#160;up&#160;&#160;behind the house. I've been terribly restless all day.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave stroked his chin. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There remains Rogers. Though I doubt if his evidence will add anything to<br/>
&#160;our&#160;&#160;sum of knowledge.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers, summoned before the court, had very little to tell. He bad been<br/>
&#160;busy all&#160;&#160;the morning about household duties and with the preparation of<br/>
&#160;lunch. He had&#160;&#160;taken cocktails onto the terrace before lunch and had then<br/>
&#160;gone up to remove his&#160;&#160;things from the attic to another room. He had not<br/>
&#160;looked out of the window during&#160;&#160;the morning and had seen nothing that could<br/>
&#160;have any bearing upon the death of&#160;&#160;General Macarthur. He would swear<br/>
&#160;definitely that there had been eight china&#160;&#160;figures upon the dining-table<br/>
&#160;when he laid the table for lunch.<br/>
&#160;&#160;At the conclusion of Rogers' evidence there was a pause.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wararave cleared his throat.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard murmured to Vera Claythorne;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The summing up will now take place!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We have inquired into the circumstances of these three deaths to the best<br/>
&#160;of our&#160;&#160;ability. Whilst probability in some cases is against certain people<br/>
&#160;being&#160;&#160;implicated, yet we cannot say definitely that any one person can be<br/>
&#160;considered&#160;&#160;as cleared of all complicity. I reiterate my positive belief<br/>
&#160;that of the seven&#160;&#160;persons assembled in this room one is a dangerous and<br/>
&#160;probably insane criminal.&#160;&#160;There is no evidence before us as to who that<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=144></a>&#160;person is. All we can do at the&#160;&#160;present juncture is to consider what<br/>
&#160;measures we can take for communicating with&#160;&#160;the mainland for help, and in<br/>
&#160;the event of help being delayed (as is only too&#160;&#160;possible given the state<br/>
&#160;of the weather) what measures we must adopt to ensure&#160;&#160;our safety.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I would ask you all to consider this carefully and to give me any<br/>
&#160;suggestions&#160;&#160;that may occur to you. In the meantime I warn everybody to be<br/>
&#160;upon his or her&#160;&#160;guard. So far the murderer has had an<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i<br/>
&#160;&#160;284&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;easy task, since his victims have been unsuspicious. From now on, it is our<br/>
&#160;task to suspect each and every one amongst us. Forewarned is forearmed. Take<br/>
&#160;no&#160;risks and be alert to danger. That is all.&#34;<br/>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;r<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard murmured beneath his breath:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The court will now adjourn. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 10<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do YOU BELIEVE it?&#34; Vera asked.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She and Philip Lombard sat on the window-sill of the living-room. Outside<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;rain poured down and the wind howled in great shuddering gusts against<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=145></a>&#160;the&#160;&#160;window-panes.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard cocked his head slightly on one side before answering. Then<br/>
&#160;he&#160;&#160;said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;C(You mean, do I believe that old Wargrave is right when he says it's one<br/>
&#160;of us?&#34;&#160;&#34;Yes.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's difficult to say. Logically, you know, he's right, and yet-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera took the words out of his mouth.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And yet it seems so incredible!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard made a grimace.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The whole thing's incredible! But after Macarthur's death there's no more<br/>
&#160;doubt&#160;&#160;as to one thing. There's no question now of accidents or suicides.<br/>
&#160;It's&#160;&#160;definitely murder. Three murders up to date.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera shivered. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's like some awful dream. I keep feeling that things like this can't<br/>
&#160;happen!&#34;&#160;He said with understanding:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I know. Presently a tap will come on the door, and early morning tea will<br/>
&#160;be&#160;&#160;brought in.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, how I wish that could happen!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said gravely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, but it won't! We're all in the dream! And we've got to be pretty much<br/>
&#160;upon&#160;&#160;our guard from now on.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said, lowering her voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If-if it is one of them-which do you think it is?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=146></a>&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard grinned suddenly. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I take it you are excepting our two selves? Well, that's all right. I know<br/>
&#160;very&#160;&#160;well that I'm not the murderer, and I don't fancy that there's<br/>
&#160;anything insane&#160;&#160;about you, Vera. You strike me as being one of the sanest<br/>
&#160;and most level-headed&#160;&#160;girls I've come across. I'd stake my reputation on<br/>
&#160;your sanity.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;With a slightly wry smile, Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Thank you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Come now, Miss Vera Claythome, aren't you going to return the compliment?&#34;<br/>
&#160;Vera hesitated a minute, then she said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You've admitted, you know, that you don't hold human life par-<br/>
&#160;&#160;t'~ularly sacred, but all the same I can't see you as-as the man who<br/>
&#160;dictated that&#160;gramophone record.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Quite right. If I were to commit one or more murders it would be solely<br/>
&#160;for what&#160;&#160;I could get out of them. This mass clearance isn't my line of<br/>
&#160;country. Good, then&#160;&#160;we'll eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five<br/>
&#160;fellow prisoners. Which of&#160;&#160;them is U. N. Owen? Well, at a guess, and with<br/>
&#160;absolutely nothing to go upon, I'd&#160;&#160;plump for Wargrave!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh!&#34; Vera sounded surprised. She thought a minute or two and then said,<br/>
&#160;&#34;Why?&#34;&#160;&#160;&#34;Hard to say exactly. But to begin with, he's an old man and he's<br/>
&#160;been presiding&#160;&#160;over courts of law for years. That is to say, he's played<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=147></a>&#160;God Almighty for a good&#160;&#160;many months every year. That must go to a man's<br/>
&#160;head eventually. He gets to see&#160;&#160;himself as all powerful, as holding the<br/>
&#160;power of life and death-and it's possible&#160;&#160;that his brain might snap and he<br/>
&#160;might want to go one step farther and be Execu-&#160;tioner and Judge<br/>
&#160;Extraordinary.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I suppose that's possible.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Who do you plump for?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Without any hesitation Vera answered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Dr. Armstrong.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard gave a low whistle.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The doctor, ch? You know, I should have put him last of all.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera shook her head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, no! Two of the deaths have been poison. That rather points<br/>
&#160;&#160;286&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;to a doctor. And then you can't get over the fact that the only thing we are<br/>
&#160;absolutely certain Mrs. Rogers had was the sleeping draught that he gave<br/>
&#160;her.&#34;&#160;Lombard admitted:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, that's true.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera persisted:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If a doctor went mad, it would be a long time before any one suspected.<br/>
&#160;And&#160;&#160;doctors overwork and have a lot of strain.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, but I doubt if he could have killed Macarthur. He wouldn't have had<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=148></a>&#160;time&#160;&#160;during that brief interval when I left him-not, that is, unless he<br/>
&#160;fairly hared&#160;&#160;down there and back again, and I doubt if he's in good enough<br/>
&#160;training to do that&#160;&#160;and show no signs of it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He didn't do it then. He had an opportunity later.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;When?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;When he went down to call the General to lunch.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip whistled again very softly. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So you think he did it then? Pretty cool thing to do.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said impatiently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What risk was there? He's the only person here with medical knowledge. He<br/>
&#160;can&#160;&#160;swear the body's been dead at least an hour and who's to contradict<br/>
&#160;him?&#34;&#160;Philip looked at her thoughtfully.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You know,&#34; he said, &#34;that's a clever idea of yours. I wonder-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Who is it, Mr. Blore? That's what I want to know. Who is it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers' face was working. His hands were clenched round the polishing<br/>
&#160;leather&#160;&#160;that he held in his hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ex-Inspector Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Eh, my ]ad, that's the question!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One of us, 'is lordship said. Which one? That's what I want to know. Who's<br/>
&#160;&#160;the fiend in'uman form?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That,&#34; said Blore, &#34;is what we all would like to know.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=149></a>&#160;&#160;Rogers said shrewdly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But you've got an idea, Mr. Blore. You've got an idea, 'aven't<br/>
&#160;&#160;you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;C47&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;_&#34; A&#160; &#160;19.1 AT3 I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;from being sure. I may be wrong. All I can say is that if I'm right the<br/>
&#160;person&#160;in question is a very cool customer-a very cool customer indeed.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers wiped the perspiration from his forehead. He said hoarsely:&#160;&#34;It's<br/>
&#160;like a bad dream, that's what it is.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said, looking at him curiously:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Got any ideas yourself, Rogers?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The butler shook his head. He said hoarsely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know. I don't know at all. And that's what's frightening the life<br/>
&#160;out&#160;&#160;of me. To have no idea.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong said violently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We must get out of here-we must-we must! At all costs!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave looked thoughtfully out of the smoking room window.<br/>
&#160;He&#160;&#160;played with the cord of his eyeglasses. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I do not, of course, profess to be a weather prophet. But I should say<br/>
&#160;that it&#160;&#160;is very unlikely that a boat could reach us-even if they knew of<br/>
&#160;our plight-under&#160;&#160;twenty-four hours-and even then only if the wind drops.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=150></a>&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong dropped his head in his hands and groaned.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And in the meantime we may all be murdered in our beds?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I hope not,&#34; said Mr. Justice Wargrave. &#34;I intend to take every possible<br/>
&#160;&#160;precaution against such a thing happening.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;It flashed across Dr. Armstrong's mind that an old man like the judge, was<br/>
&#160;far&#160;&#160;more tenacious of life than a younger man would be. He had often<br/>
&#160;marvelled at&#160;&#160;that fact in his professional career. Here was he, junior to<br/>
&#160;the judge by perhaps&#160;&#160;twenty years, and yet with a vastly inferior sense of<br/>
&#160;self-preservation.&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave was thinking:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Murdered in our beds! These doctors are all the same-they think in<br/>
&#160;cliches. A&#160;&#160;thoroughly commonplace mind.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There have been three victims already, remember.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Certainly. But you must remember that they were unprepared for the attack.<br/>
&#160;We&#160;&#160;are forewarned.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Arrnstron~4 said bitterly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;288&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What can we do? Sooner or later-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I think,&#34; said Mr. Justice Wargrave, &#34;that there are several things we can<br/>
&#160;&#160;do.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We've no idea, even, who it can be-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge stroked his chin and murmured:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=151></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, you know, I wouldn't quite say that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong stared at him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do you mean you know?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said cautiously:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;As regards actual evidence, such as is necessary in court, I admit that<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;have none. But it appears to me, reviewing the whole business, that one<br/>
&#160;&#160;particular person is sufficiently clearly indicated. Yes, I think so.<br/>
&#160;Armstrong stared at him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't understand.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent was upstairs in her bedroom.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She took up her Bible and went to sit by the window.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She opened it. Then, after a minutes hesitation, she set it aside and went<br/>
&#160;over&#160;&#160;to the dressing-table. From a drawer in it she took out a small black-<br/>
&#160;covered&#160;&#160;notebook.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She opened it and began writing.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A terrible thing has happened. General Macarthur is dead. (His cousin<br/>
&#160;married&#160;&#160;Elsie MacPherson.) There is no doubt but that he was murdered.<br/>
&#160;After luncheon the&#160;&#160;judge made us a most interesting speech. He is convinced<br/>
&#160;that the murderer is one&#160;&#160;of us. That means that one of us is possessed by<br/>
&#160;a devil. I had already suspected&#160;&#160;that. Which of us is it? They are all<br/>
&#160;asking themselves that. I alone know. . .&#160;&#160;.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She sat for some time without moving. Her eyes grew vague and filmy. The<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=152></a>&#160;pencil&#160;&#160;straggled drunkenly in her fingers. In shaking loose capitals she<br/>
&#160;wrote:&#160;&#160;THE MURDERER'S NAME is BEATRICE TAYLOR. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her eyes closed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Suddenly, with a start, she awoke. She looked down at the note-<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;ff<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;book. With an angry exclamation she scored through the vague unevenly<br/>
&#160;scrawled&#160;characters of the last sentence. She said in a low voice: &#34;Did I<br/>
&#160;write that?&#160;Did I? I must be going mad.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The storm increased. The wind howled against the side of the house.&#160;&#160;Every<br/>
&#160;one was in the living-room. They sat listlessly huddled together. And,&#160;<br/>
&#160;surreptitiously, they watched each other.<br/>
&#160;&#160;When Rocyers brought in the tea-tray, they all jumped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Shall I draw the curtains? It would make it more cheerful like.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Receiving an assent to this, the curtains were drawn and the lamps turned<br/>
&#160;on. The&#160;&#160;room grew more cheerful. A little of the shadow lifted. Surely, by<br/>
&#160;to-morrow, the&#160;&#160;storm would be over and some one would come-a boat would<br/>
&#160;arrive.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythome said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=153></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Will you pour out tea, Miss Brent?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The elder woman replied:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, you do it, dear. That tea-pot is so heavy. And I have lost two skeins<br/>
&#160;of my&#160;&#160;grey knitting-wool. So annoying.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera moved to the tea-table. There was a cheerful rattle and clink of<br/>
&#160;china.&#160;&#160;Normality returned.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Tea! Blessed ordinary everyday afternoon tea! Philip Lombard made a cheery<br/>
&#160;&#160;remark. Blore responded. Dr. Armstrong told a humorous story. Mr. Justice<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave, who ordinarily hated tea, sipped approvingly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Into this relaxed atmosphere came Rogers.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And Rogers was upset. He said nervously and at random:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Excuse me, sir, but does any one know what's become of the bathroom<br/>
&#160;curtain?&#34;&#160;Lombard's head went up with a jerk.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The bathroom curtain? What the devil do you mean, Rogers?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's gone, sir, clean vanished. I was going round drawing all the<br/>
&#160;curtaiiis and&#160;&#160;the one in the lav-bathroom wasn't there any longer.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave asked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Was it there this morning?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;290&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, yes, sir.&#34; Blore said: &#34;What kind of a curtain was it?&#34; &#34;Scarlet<br/>
&#160;oilsilk,&#160;sir. It went with the scarlet tiles.&#34; Lombard said: &#34;And it's<br/>
&#160;gone?&#34; &#34;Gone,&#160;Sir.&#34; They stared at each other. Blore said heavily: &#34;Well-<br/>
&#160;after all-what of&#160;it? It's mad-but so's everything else. Anyway, it doesn't<br/>
&#160;matter. You can't&#160;kill anybody with an oilsilk curtain. Forget about it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Rogers said: &#34;Yes, sir,&#160;thank you, sir.&#34; He went out, shutting the door<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=154></a>&#160;behind him. Inside the room,&#160;the pall of fear had fallen anew. Again,<br/>
&#160;surreptitiously, they watched each&#160;other.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;6<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dinner came, was eaten, and cleared away. A simple meal, mostly out of<br/>
&#160;tins.&#160;&#160;Afterwards, in the living-room, the strain was almost too great to<br/>
&#160;be borne.&#160;&#160;At nine o'clock, Emily Brent rose to her feet. She said: &#34;I'm<br/>
&#160;going to bed.&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera said: &#34;I'll go to bed too.&#34; The two women went up the<br/>
&#160;stairs and Lombard&#160;&#160;and Blore came with them. Standing at the top of the<br/>
&#160;stairs, the two men&#160;&#160;watched the women go into their respective rooms and<br/>
&#160;shut the doors. They&#160;&#160;heard the sound of two bolts being shot and the<br/>
&#160;turning of two keys. Blore&#160;&#160;said with a grin: &#34;No need to tell 'em to lock<br/>
&#160;their doors!&#34; Lombard said:&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, they're all right for the night, at any<br/>
&#160;rate!&#34; He went down again and&#160;&#160;the other followed him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;7<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The four men went to bed an hour later. They went up together. Rogers, from<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;dining-room where he was setting the table for breakfast, saw them go<br/>
&#160;up. He&#160;&#160;heard them pause on the landing above.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then the judge's voice spoke.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I need hardly advise you, gentlemen, to lock your doors.'<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=155></a>&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And, what's more, put a chair under the handle. There are ways of turning<br/>
&#160;locks&#160;&#160;from the outside.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My dear Blore, the trouble with you is you know too much!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said gravely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Good-night, gentlemen. May we all meet safely in the morning!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers came out of the dining-room and slipped halfway up the stairs. He<br/>
&#160;saw four&#160;&#160;figures pass through four doors and heard the turning of four<br/>
&#160;locks and the&#160;&#160;shooting of four bolts.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He nodded his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's all right,&#34; he muttered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He went back into the dining-room. Yes, everything was ready for the<br/>
&#160;morning. His&#160;&#160;eye lingered on the centre plaque of looking-glass and the<br/>
&#160;seven little china&#160;&#160;figures.<br/>
&#160;&#160;A sudden grin transformed his face.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll see no one plays tricks to-night, at any rate.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Crossing the room he locked the door to the pantry. Then going through the<br/>
&#160;other&#160;&#160;door to the hall he pulled the door to, locked it and slipped the key<br/>
&#160;into his&#160;&#160;pocket.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then, extinguishing the lights, he hurried up the stairs and into his new<br/>
&#160;&#160;bedroom.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was only one possible hiding-place in it, the tall wardrobe, and lie<br/>
&#160;looked&#160;&#160;into that immediately. Then, locking and bolting the door, he<br/>
&#160;prepared for bed.&#160;He said to himself:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=156></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;No more Indiaii tricks to-night. I've seen to that . . . ...<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 11<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;PHILIP LOMBARD had the habit of waking at daybreak. He did so on this<br/>
&#160;particular&#160;morning. He raised himself on an elbow and listened. The wind had<br/>
&#160;somewhat abated&#160;but was still blowing. He could hear no sound of rain. . .<br/>
&#160;.<br/>
&#160;&#160;At eight o'clock the wind was blowing more strongly, but Lombard did not<br/>
&#160;hear it.&#160;&#160;He was asleep again.<br/>
&#160;&#160;At nine-tbirty he was sitting on the edge of his bed looking at his watch.<br/>
&#160;He put&#160;&#160;it to his ear. Then his lips drew back from his teeth in that<br/>
&#160;curious wolf-like&#160;&#160;smile characteristic of the man.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said very softly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I think the time has come to do something about this.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;At twenty-five minutes to ten he was tapping on the closed door of Blore's<br/>
&#160;room.&#160;&#160;The latter opened it cautiously. His hair was tousled and his eyes<br/>
&#160;were still dim&#160;&#160;with sleep.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said affably:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Sleeping the clock round? Well, shows you've got an easy conscience.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Blore said shortly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's the matter?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard answered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Anybody called you-or brought you any tea? Do you know what time it is?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=157></a>&#160;&#160;Blore looked over his shoulder at a small travelling clock by his bedside.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Twenty-five to ten. Wouldn't have believed I could have slept like that.<br/>
&#160;Where's&#160;&#160;Rogers?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's a case of echo answers where?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What d'you mean?&#34; asked the other sharply.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I mean that Rogers is missing. He isn't in his room or anywhere else. And<br/>
&#160;&#160;there's no kettle on and the kitchen fire isn't even fit.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore swore under his breath. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Where the devil can he be? Out on the island somewhere? Wait<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;293<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard nodded. He moved along the line of closed doors. He found<br/>
&#160;Armstron&#160;up and nearly dressed. Mr. Justice Wargrave, like Blore, had to be<br/>
&#160;roused from&#160;sleep. Vera Claythorne was dressed. Emily Brent's room was<br/>
&#160;empty.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The little party moved through the house. Rogers' room, as Philip Lombard<br/>
&#160;had&#160;&#160;already ascertained, was untenanted. The bed had been slept in, and his<br/>
&#160;razor and&#160;&#160;sponge and soap were wet.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He got up all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said in a low voice which she tried to make firm and assured: &#34;You<br/>
&#160;don't&#160;think he's-hiding somewhere-waiting for us?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=158></a>&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My dear girl, I'm prepared to think anything of any one! My advice is that<br/>
&#160;we&#160;&#160;keep together until we find him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He must be out on the island somewhere.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore who had joined them, dressed, but still unshaved, said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Where's Miss Brent got to-that's another mystery?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But as they arrived in the hall, Emily Brent came in through the front<br/>
&#160;door. She&#160;&#160;had on a mackintosh. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The sea is as high as ever. I shouldn't think any boat could put out to-<br/>
&#160;day.&#34;&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Have you been wandering about the island alone, Miss Brent? Don't you<br/>
&#160;realize&#160;&#160;that that's an exceedingly foolish thing to do?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I assure you, Mr. Blore, that I kept an extremely sharp lookout.&#34; Blore<br/>
&#160;grunted.&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Seen anything of Rogers?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Miss Brent's eyebrows rose.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Rogers? No, I haven't seen him this morning. Why?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave, shaved, dressed and with his false teeth in position,<br/>
&#160;came&#160;&#160;down the stairs. He moved to the open dining-room door. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ha, laid the table for breakfast, I see.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He might have done that last night.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They all moved inside the room, looking at the neatly set plates and<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=159></a>&#160;cutlery. At&#160;&#160;the row of cups on the sideboard. At the felt mats placed ready<br/>
&#160;for the coffee&#160;&#160;urn.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was Vera who saw it first. She caught the judge's arm and the Prin of<br/>
&#160;&#160;herathletic finper,, made the old Pentleman wince<br/>
&#160;&#160;294<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She cried out: &#34;The Indians! Look!&#34; There were only six china figures in the<br/>
&#160;middle of the table.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They found him shortly afterwards.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He was in the little wash-house across the yard. He had been chopping<br/>
&#160;sticks in&#160;&#160;preparation for lighting the kitchen fire. The small chopper was<br/>
&#160;still in his&#160;&#160;hand. A bigger chopper, a heavy affair, was leaning against<br/>
&#160;the door-the metal&#160;&#160;of it stained a dull brown. It corresponded only too<br/>
&#160;well with the deep wound in&#160;&#160;the back of Rogers' head. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Perfectly clear,&#34; said Armstrong. &#34;The murderer must have crept up behind<br/>
&#160;him,&#160;&#160;swung the chopper once and brought it down on his head as he was<br/>
&#160;bending over.&#34;&#160;&#160;Blore was busy on the handle of the chopper and the flour<br/>
&#160;sifter from the&#160;&#160;kitchen.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=160></a>&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave asked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Would it have needed great force, doctor?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said gravely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A woman could have done it if that's what you mean.&#34; He gave a quick<br/>
&#160;glance&#160;&#160;round. Vera Claythorne and Emily Brent had retired to the kitchen.<br/>
&#160;&#34;The girl&#160;&#160;could have done it easily-she's an athletic type. In appearance<br/>
&#160;Miss Brent is&#160;&#160;fragile looking, but that type of woman has often a lot of<br/>
&#160;wiry strength. And you&#160;&#160;must remember that any one who's mentally unhinged<br/>
&#160;has a good deal of unsuspected&#160;&#160;strength.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge nodded thoughtfully.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore rose from his knees with a sigh. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No fingerprints. Handle was wiped afterwards.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A sound of laughter was heard-they turned sharply. Vera Claythorne was<br/>
&#160;standing&#160;&#160;in the yard. She cried out in a high shrill voice, shaken with<br/>
&#160;wild himtz nf&#160;&#160;lnimht~r-<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i~<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do they keep bees on this island? Tell me that. Where do we go for honey?<br/>
&#160;Ha!&#160;&#160;ha!&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=161></a>&#160;&#160;They stared at her uncomprehendingly. It was as though the sane well-<br/>
&#160;balanced&#160;&#160;girl had gone mad before their eyes. She went on in that high<br/>
&#160;unnatural voice.&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't stare like that! As though you thought I was mad.<br/>
&#160;It's sane enough what&#160;&#160;I'm asking. Bees, hives, bees! Oh, don't you<br/>
&#160;understand? Haven't you read that&#160;&#160;idiotic rhyme? It's up in all your<br/>
&#160;bedrooms-put there for you to study! We might&#160;&#160;have come here straightaway<br/>
&#160;if we'd had sense. Seven little Indian boys chopping&#160;&#160;up sticks. And the<br/>
&#160;next verse. I know the whole thing by heart, I tell you! Six&#160;&#160;little Indian<br/>
&#160;boys playing with a hive. And that's why I'm asking-do they keep&#160;&#160;bees on<br/>
&#160;this island?-isn't it funny?-isn't it damned funny . . . T'&#160;&#160;She began<br/>
&#160;laughing wildly again. Dr. Armstrong strode forward. He raised his hand&#160;&#160;and<br/>
&#160;struck her a flat blow on the cheek.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She gasped, hiccuped-and swallowed. She stood motionless a minute, then she<br/>
&#160;said:&#160;&#160;&#34;Thank you . . . I'm all right now.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her voice was once more calm and controlled-the voice of the efficient<br/>
&#160;games&#160;&#160;mistress.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She turned and went across the yard into the kitchen saying: &#34;Miss Brent<br/>
&#160;and I&#160;&#160;are getting you breakfast. Can you-bring some sticks to light the<br/>
&#160;fire?&#34;&#160;&#160;The marks of the doctor's hand stood out red on her cheek.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As she went into the kitchen Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, you dealt with that all right, doctor.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said apologetically:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Had to! We can't cope with hysteria on the top of everything else.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She's not a hysterical type.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong agreed.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=162></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, no. Good healthy sensible girl. Just the sudden shock. It might happen<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;anybody.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers had chopped a certain amount of firewood before he had been killed.<br/>
&#160;They&#160;&#160;gathered it up and took it into the kitchen. Vera and Emily Brent were<br/>
&#160;busy. Miss&#160;&#160;Brent was raking out the stove. Vera was cutting the rind off<br/>
&#160;the bacon.&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Thank you. We'll be as quick as we can-say half an hour to<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;296<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ex-Inspector Blore said in a low hoarse voice to Philip Lombard: &#34;Know what<br/>
&#160;I'm&#160;thinkina?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;As you're just about to tell me, it's not worth the trouble of guessing.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ex-Inspector Blore was an earnest man. A light touch was incomprehensible<br/>
&#160;to him.&#160;&#160;He went on heavily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There was a case in America. Old gentleman and his wife-both killed with<br/>
&#160;an axe.&#160;&#160;Middle of the morning. Nobody in the house but the daughter and the<br/>
&#160;maid. Maid,&#160;&#160;it was proved, couldn't have done it. Daughter was a<br/>
&#160;respectable middle-aged&#160;&#160;spinster. Seemed incredible. So incredible that<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=163></a>&#160;they acquitted her. But they&#160;&#160;never found any other explanation.&#34; He paused.<br/>
&#160;&#34;I thought of that when I saw the&#160;&#160;axe -and then when I went into the<br/>
&#160;kitchen and saw her there so neat and calm.&#160;&#160;Hadn't turned a hair! That<br/>
&#160;girl, coming all over hysterical -well, that's&#160;&#160;natural-the sort of thing<br/>
&#160;you'd expect-don't you think so?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said laconically:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It might be.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore went on.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But the other! So neat and prim-wrapped up in that apron-Mrs. Rogers'<br/>
&#160;apron, I&#160;&#160;suppose-saying: 'Breakfast will be ready in half an hour or so.'<br/>
&#160;If you ask me&#160;&#160;that woman's as mad as a hatter! Lots of elderly spinsters<br/>
&#160;go that way-I don't&#160;&#160;mean go in for homicide on the grand scale, but go<br/>
&#160;queer in their heads.&#160;&#160;Unfortunately it's taken her this way. Religious<br/>
&#160;mania-thinks she's God's&#160;&#160;instrument, something of that kind! She sits in<br/>
&#160;her room, you know, reading her&#160;&#160;Bible.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard sighed and said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's hardly proof positive of an unbalanced mentality, Blore.&#34; But Blore<br/>
&#160;went&#160;on, ploddingly, perseveringly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And then she was out-in her mackintosh, said she'd been down to look at<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;sea.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The other shook his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Rogers was killed as lie was chopping firewood-that is to say first thing<br/>
&#160;when&#160;&#160;lie got up. Miss Brent wouldn't have needed to wander<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=164></a>&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;297<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;about outside for hours afterwards. If you ask me, the murderer of Rogers<br/>
&#160;would&#160;take jolly good care to be rolled up in bed snoring.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're missing the point, Mr. Lombard. If the woman was innocent she'd be<br/>
&#160;too&#160;&#160;dead scared to go wandering about by herself. She'd only do that if she<br/>
&#160;knew that&#160;&#160;she had nothing to fear. That's to say if she herself is the<br/>
&#160;criminal.&#34;&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's a good point. . . . Yes, I hadn't thought of that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He added with a faint grin:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Glad you don't still suspect me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said rather shamefacedly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I did start by thinking of you-that revolver-and the queer story you told-<br/>
&#160;or&#160;&#160;didn't tell. But I've realized now that that was really a bit too<br/>
&#160;obvious.&#34; He&#160;&#160;paused and said: &#34;Hope you feel the same about me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip said thoughtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I may be wrong, of course, but I can't feel that you've got enough<br/>
&#160;imagination&#160;&#160;for this job. All I can say is, if you're the criminal, you're<br/>
&#160;a damned fine&#160;&#160;actor and I take my hat off to you.&#34; He lowered his voice.<br/>
&#160;&#34;Just between&#160;&#160;ourselves, Blore, and taking into account that we'll probably<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=165></a>&#160;both be a couple&#160;&#160;of stiffs before another day is out, you did indulge in<br/>
&#160;that spot of perjury, I&#160;&#160;suppose?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore shifted uneasily from one foot to the other. He said at last:&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;Doesn't seem to make much odds now. Oh, well, here goes. Landor was innocent<br/>
&#160;&#160;right enough. The gang had got me squared and between us we got him put away<br/>
&#160;for&#160;&#160;a stretch. Mind you, I wouldn't admit this-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If there were any witnesses,&#34; finished Lombard with a grin. &#34;It's just<br/>
&#160;between&#160;&#160;you and me. Well, I hope you made a tidy bit out of it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Didn't make what I should have done. Mean crowd, the Purcell gang. I got<br/>
&#160;my&#160;&#160;promotion, though.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And Landor got penal servitude and died in prison.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I couldn't know he was going to die, could IT' demanded Blore.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, that was your bad luck.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Mine? His, you mean.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yours, too. Because, as a result of it, it looks as though your own life<br/>
&#160;is&#160;&#160;going to be cut unpleasantly short.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Me?&#34; Blore stared at him. &#34;Do you think I'm going to go the way of Rogers<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;the rest of them? Not me! I'm watching out for mysel<br/>
&#160;&#160;pretty carefully, I can tell you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;T&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;I-A: A<br/>
&#160;&#160;298&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, well-I'm not a betting man. And anyway if you were dead I wouldn't get<br/>
&#160;&#160;paid.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here, Mr. Lombard, what do you mean?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard showed his teeth. He said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=166></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;I mean, my dear Blore, that in my opinion you haven't got a chance!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#34;What?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Your lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target.<br/>
&#160;A&#160;&#160;criminal of the imagination of U. N. Owen can make rings round you any<br/>
&#160;time&#160;&#160;he-or she-wants to.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore's face went crimson. He demanded angrily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And what about you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard's face went hard and dangerous.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've a pretty good imagination of my own. I've been in tight places before<br/>
&#160;&#160;now and got out of them! I think-I won't say more than that but I think I'll<br/>
&#160;&#160;get out of this one.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;The eg s were in the frying-pan. Vera, at the stove, thought to her.9 self:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why did I make a hysterical fool of myself? That was a mistake. Keep calm,<br/>
&#160;my&#160;&#160;girl, keep calm.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;After all, she'd always prided herself on her levelheadedness!<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Miss Claythorne was wonderful-kept her head-started off swimming after<br/>
&#160;Cyril&#160;&#160;at once.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Why think of that now? All that was over-over. . . . Cyril had<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;disappeared long before she got near the rock. She had felt the current take<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=167></a>&#160;her, sweeping her out to sea. She had let herself go with itswimming quietly,<br/>
&#160;floating-till the boat arrived at last . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;They had praised her courage and her sang-froid . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;But not Hugo. Hugo had just-looked at her . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;God, how it hurt, even now, to think of Hugo . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Where was he? What was he doing? Was he engaged-married?<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Vera, that bacon is burning.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, sorry, Miss Brent, so it is. How stupid of me.&#34;<br/>

&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera, putting fresh pieces of bacon in the frying-pan, said curiously:&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;You're wonderfully calm, Miss Brent.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily Brent said, pressing her lips together:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I was brought up to keep my head and never to make a fuss.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera thought mechanically:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Repressed as a child. . . . That accounts for a lot.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=168></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Aren't you afraid?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She paused and then added:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Or don't you mind dying?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dying! It was as though a sharp little gimlet had run into the solid<br/>
&#160;congealed&#160;&#160;mass of Emily Brent's brain. Dying? But she wasn't going to die!<br/>
&#160;The otherswould&#160;&#160;die-yes-but not she, Emily Brent. This girl didn't<br/>
&#160;understand! Emily wasn't&#160;&#160;afraid, naturally-none of the Brents were afraid.<br/>
&#160;All her people were Service&#160;&#160;people. They faced death unflinchingly. They<br/>
&#160;led upright lives just as she, Emily&#160;&#160;Brent, had led an upright life. . .<br/>
&#160;. She had never done anything to be ashamed&#160;&#160;of. . . . And so, naturally,<br/>
&#160;she wasn't going to die. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The Lord is mindful of his own.&#34; &#34;Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror<br/>
&#160;by&#160;&#160;night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day. . . .&#34; It was daylight now-<br/>
&#160;there was&#160;&#160;no terror. &#34;We shall none of us leave this island.&#34; Who had said<br/>
&#160;that? General&#160;&#160;Macarthur, of course, whose cousin had married Elsie<br/>
&#160;MacPherson. He hadn't seemed&#160;&#160;to care. He had seemed-actually-to welcome the<br/>
&#160;idea! Wicked! Almost impious to&#160;&#160;feel that way. Some people thought so<br/>
&#160;little of death that they actually took&#160;&#160;their own lives. Beatrice Taylor.<br/>
&#160;. . . Last night she had dreamed of&#160;&#160;Beatrice-dreamt that she was outside<br/>
&#160;pressing her face against the window and&#160;&#160;moaning, asking to be let in. But<br/>
&#160;Emily Brent hadn't wanted to let her in.&#160;&#160;Because, if she did, something<br/>
&#160;terrible would happen. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily came to herself with a start. That girl was looking at her very<br/>
&#160;strangely.&#160;&#160;She said in a brisk voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Everything's ready, isn't it? We'll take the breakfast in.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Breakfast was a curious meal. Every one was very polite. &#34;May I get you some<br/>
&#160;more coffee, Miss Brent?&#34;<br/>

&#160;&#160;&#34;Another piece of bacon?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Six people, all outwardly self-possessed and normal.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And within? Thoughts that ran round in a circle like squirrels in a cage.<br/>
&#160;. .&#160;&#160;.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What next? What next? Who? Which?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Would it work? I wonder. It's worth trying. If there's time. My<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;God, if there's time . . . ...<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Religious mania, that's the ticket. . . . Looking at her, though,<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;you can hardly believe it. . . . Suppose I'm wrong. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's crazy-everything's crazy. I'm going crazy. Wool disappearing -red<br/>
&#160;silk&#160;&#160;curtains-it doesn't make sense. I can't get the hang of it. . . .&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;The damned fool, he believed every word I said to him. It was easy. . . .<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;must be careful, though, very careful.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Six of those little china figures be by to-night? . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Who'll have the last egg?&#34;<br/>

&#160;&#160;Six people, behaving normally at breakfast. . .<br/>

&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 12<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;only six-how many will there<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;THE MEAL was over. Mr. Justice Wargrave cleared his throat. He said in a<br/>
&#160;small&#160;authoritative voice: &#34;It would be advisable, I think, if we met to<br/>
&#160;discuss the&#160;situation. Shall we say in half an hour's time in the drawing-<br/>
&#160;room?&#34; Every one&#160;made a sound suggestive of agreement. Vera began to pile<br/>
&#160;plates together. She&#160;said: &#34;I'll clear away and wash up.&#34; Philip Lombard<br/>
&#160;said: &#34;We'll bring the&#160;stuff out to the pantry for you.&#34; &#34;Thanks.&#34; Emily<br/>
&#160;Brent, rising to her feet,&#160;sat clown again. She said: &#34;Oh, dear.&#34; The judge<br/>
&#160;said: &#34;Anything the matter,&#160;Miss Brent?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Emily said apologetically:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm sorry. I'd like to help Miss Claythorne, but I don't know how it is.<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;feel just a little giddy.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Giddy, eh?&#34; Dr. Armstrong came towards her. &#34;Quite natural. Delayed shock.<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;can give you something to-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The word burst from her lips like an exploding shell.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=171></a>&#160;&#160;It took every one aback. Dr. Armstrong flushed a deep red.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was no mistaking the fear and suspicion in her face. He said stiffly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Just as you please, Miss Brent.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't wish to take anything-anything at all. I will just sit here<br/>
&#160;quietly&#160;&#160;till the giddiness passes off.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They finished clearing away the breakfast things.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm a domestic sort of man. I'll give you a hand, Miss Claythorne.&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera<br/>
&#160;said: &#34;Thank you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;Emily Brent was left alone sitting in the dining-room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;For a while she heard a faint murmur of voices from the pantry.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The giddiness was passing. She felt drowsy now, as though she could easily<br/>
&#160;go&#160;&#160;to sleep.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a buzzing in her ears-or was it a real buzzing in the room?&#160;&#160;She<br/>
&#160;thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's like a bee-a bumblebee.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Presently she saw the bee. It was crawling up the window-pane.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne had talked about bees this morning.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Bees and honey.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She liked honey. Honey in the comb, and strain it yourself through a muslin<br/>
&#160;&#160;bag. Drip, drip, drip. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was somebody in the room ping. . . . Beatrice Taylor came from the<br/>
&#160;&#160;river. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She had only to turn her head and she would see her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But she couldn't turn her head.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=172></a>&#160;&#160;If she were to call out . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;But she couldn't call out. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was no one else in the house. She was all alone.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She heard footsteps-soft dragging footsteps coming up behind her. Tile&#160;<br/>
&#160;stumbling footsteps of the drowned girl.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a wet dank smell in her nostrils.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. somebody all wet and drip-<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;302&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;On the window-pane the bee was buzzing-buzzing. And then she felt the prick.<br/>
&#160;The bee sting on the side of her neck.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the drawing-room they were waiting for Emily Brent.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Shall I go and fetch her?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said quickly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Just a minute.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera sat down again. Every one looked inquiringly at Blore.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here, everybody, my opinion's this: we needn't look farther for the<br/>
&#160;author&#160;&#160;of these deaths than the dining-room at this minute. I'd take my<br/>
&#160;oath that&#160;&#160;woman's the one we're after!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=173></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;And the motive?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Religious mania. What do you say, doctor?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's perfectly possible. I've nothing to say against it. But of course<br/>
&#160;we've no&#160;&#160;proof.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;She was very odd in the kitchen when we were getting breakfast. Her eyes-&#34;<br/>
&#160;She&#160;&#160;shivered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You can't judge her by that. We're all a bit off our heads by now!&#34;&#160;Blore<br/>
&#160;said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's another thing. She's the only one who wouldn't give an explanation<br/>
&#160;after&#160;&#160;that gramophone record. Why? Because she hadn't any to give.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera stirred in her chair. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's not quite true. She told me-afterwards.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What did she tell you, Miss Claythorne?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera repeated the story of Beatrice Taylor.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave observed:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A perfectly straightforward story. I personally should have no<br/>
&#160;&#160;rl;ffio,df~, ;~ --f;- 4 7.11 - TM-A;A A- -_- f-<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;303<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=174></a>&#160;&#160;be troubled by a sense of guilt or a feeling of remorse for her attitude in<br/>
&#160;the&#160;matter?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;None whatever,&#34; said Vera. &#34;She was completely unmoved.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Hearts as hard as flints, these righteous spinsters! Envy, mostly!&#34; Mr.<br/>
&#160;Justice&#160;Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It is now five minutes to eleven. I think we should summon Miss Brent to<br/>
&#160;join&#160;&#160;our conclave.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Aren't you going to take any action?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I fail to see what action we can take. Our suspicions are, at the moment,<br/>
&#160;only&#160;&#160;suspicions. I will, however, ask Dr. Armstrong to observe Miss Brent's<br/>
&#160;demeanour&#160;&#160;very carefully. Let us now go into the dining-room.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They found Emily Brent sitting in the chair in which they had left her.<br/>
&#160;From&#160;&#160;behind they saw nothing amiss, except that she did not seem to hear<br/>
&#160;their&#160;&#160;entrance into the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then they saw her face-suffused with blood, with blue lips and staring<br/>
&#160;eyes.&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My God, she's dead!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The small quiet voice of Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One more of us acquitted-too late!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong was bent over the dead woman. He sniffed the lips, shook his<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=175></a>&#160;head,&#160;&#160;peered into the eyelids.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said impatiently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;How did she die, doctor? She was all right when we left her here!&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;Armstrong's attention was riveted on a mark on the right side of the neck.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;nat's the mark of a hypodermic syringe.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a buzzing sound from the window. Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look-a bee-a bumblebee. Remember what I said this morning!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;304&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It wasn't that bee that stung her! A human hand held the syringe.&#34;&#160;The<br/>
&#160;judge asked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What poison was injected?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong answered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;At a guess, one of the Cyanides. Probably Potassium Cyanide, same as<br/>
&#160;Anthony&#160;&#160;Marston. She must have died almost immediately by asphyxiation.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But that bee? It can't be coincidence?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said grimly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, no, it isn't coincidence! It's our murderer's touch of local colour!<br/>
&#160;He's&#160;&#160;a playful beast. Likes to stick to his damnable nursery jingle as<br/>
&#160;closely as&#160;&#160;possible!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;For the first time his voice was uneven, almost shrill. It was as though<br/>
&#160;even his&#160;&#160;nerves, seasoned by a long career of hazards and dangerous<br/>
&#160;undertakings, had&#160;&#160;given out at last.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=176></a>&#160;&#160;He said violently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's mad!-absolutely mad-we're all mad!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said calmly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We have still, I hope, our reasoning powers. Did any one bring a<br/>
&#160;hypodermic&#160;&#160;syringe to this house?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong, straightening himself, said in a voice that was not too well<br/>
&#160;&#160;assured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I did.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Four pairs of eyes fastened on him. He braced himself against the deep<br/>
&#160;hostile&#160;&#160;suspicion of those eyes. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Always travel with one. Most doctors do.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said calmly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Quite so. Will you tell us, doctor, where that syringe is now?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In the suitcase in my room.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We might, perhaps, verify that fact.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The five of them went upstairs, a silent procession.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The contents of the suitcase were turned out on the floor.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The hypodermic syringe was not there.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;305<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=177></a>&#160;&#160;Armstrong said violently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Somebody must have taken it!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was silence in the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong stood with his back to the window. Four pairs of eyes were on<br/>
&#160;him,&#160;&#160;black with suspicion and accusation. He looked from Wargrave to Vera<br/>
&#160;and repeated&#160;&#160;helplessly-weakly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I tell you some one must have taken it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore was looking at Lombard who returned his gaze.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There are five of us here in this room. One of us is a murderer. The<br/>
&#160;position&#160;&#160;is fraught with grave danger. Everything must be done in order to<br/>
&#160;safeguard the&#160;&#160;four of us who are innocent. I will now ask you, Dr.<br/>
&#160;Armstrong, what drugs you&#160;&#160;have in your possession?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong replied:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I have a small medicine case here. You can examine it. You will find some<br/>
&#160;&#160;sleeping stuff-trional and sulphonal tablets-a packet of bromide,<br/>
&#160;bicarbonate of&#160;&#160;soda, aspirin. Nothing else. I have no Cyanide in my<br/>
&#160;possession.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I have, myself, some sleeping tablets-sulphonal, I think they are. I<br/>
&#160;presume&#160;&#160;they would be lethal if a sufficiently large dose were given. You,<br/>
&#160;Mr. Lombard,&#160;&#160;have in your possession a revolver.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What if I have?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Only this. I propose that the doctor's supply of drugs, my own sulphonal<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=178></a>&#160;&#160;tablets, your revolver and anything else of the nature of drugs or firearms<br/>
&#160;&#160;should be collected together and placed in a safe place. That after this is<br/>
&#160;done,&#160;&#160;we should each of us submit to a search -both of our persons and of<br/>
&#160;our effects.&#34;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm damned if I'll give up my revolver!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Mr. Lombard, you are a very strongly built and powerful young man, but&#160;<br/>
&#160;ex-Inspector Blore is also a man of powerful physique. I do not know what the<br/>
&#160;&#160;outcome of a struggle between you would be but I can tell you this. On<br/>
&#160;Blore's&#160;&#160;side, assisting him to the best of our abilitv will hn. mv-elf Dr<br/>
&#160;Arm-trnno, qnd&#160;&#160;Mi-q Clqvthorne You will an-<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;preciate, therefore, that the odds against you if you choose to resist will<br/>
&#160;be&#160;somewhat heavy.&#34; Lombard threw his head back. His teeth showed in what<br/>
&#160;was al- most a snarl. &#34;Oh, very well then. Since you've got it all taped<br/>
&#160;out.&#34; Mr.&#160;Justice Wargrave nodded his head. &#34;You are a sensible young man.<br/>
&#160;Where is this&#160;revolver of yours?&#34; &#34;In the drawer of the table by my bed.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#34;Good.&#34; &#34;I'll fetch&#160;it.&#34; &#34;I think it would be desirable if we went with<br/>
&#160;you.&#34; Philip said with a&#160;smile that was still nearer a snarl: &#34;Suspicious<br/>
&#160;devil, aren't you?&#34; They went&#160;along the corridor to Lombard's room. Philip<br/>
&#160;strode across to the bed-table and&#160;jerked open the drawer. Then he recoiled<br/>
&#160;with an oath. The drawer of the&#160;bed-table was empty.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=179></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Satisfied?&#34; asked Lombard.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He had stripped to the skin and he and his room had been meticulously<br/>
&#160;searched&#160;&#160;by the other three men. Vera Claythorne was outside in the<br/>
&#160;corridor.&#160;&#160;The search proceeded methodically. In turn, Armstrong, the judge<br/>
&#160;and Blore&#160;&#160;submitted to the same test.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The four men emerged from Blore's room and approached Vera. It was the<br/>
&#160;judge who&#160;&#160;spoke.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I hope you will understand, Miss Claytborne, that we can make no<br/>
&#160;exceptions.&#160;&#160;That revolver must be found. You have, I presume, a bathing<br/>
&#160;dress with you?&#34;&#160;Vera nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Then I will ask you to go into your room and put it on and then come out<br/>
&#160;to us&#160;&#160;here.)'<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera went into her room and shut the door. She reappeared in under a minute<br/>
&#160;&#160;dressed in a tight-fitting silk rucked bathing dress.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave nodded approval.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Thank you, Miss Claythorne. Now if you will remain here, we xv;n --6 --, -<br/>
&#160;_ I$<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;307<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera waited patiently in the corridor until they emerged. Then she went in,<br/>
&#160;&#160;dressed, and came out to where they were waiting.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=180></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;We are now assured of one thing. There are no lethal weapons or drugs in<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;possession of any of us five. That is one point to the good. We will<br/>
&#160;now place&#160;&#160;the drugs in a safe place. There is, I think, a silver chest, is<br/>
&#160;there not, in&#160;&#160;the pantry?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's all very well, but who's to have the key? You, I suppose.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave made no reply.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He went down to the pantry and the others followed him. There was a small<br/>
&#160;case&#160;&#160;there designed for the purpose of holding silver and plate. By the<br/>
&#160;judge's&#160;&#160;directions, the various drugs were placed in this and it was<br/>
&#160;locked. Then, still&#160;&#160;on Wargrave's instructions, the chest was lifted into<br/>
&#160;the plate cupboard and this&#160;&#160;in turn was locked. The judge then gave the key<br/>
&#160;of the chest to Philip Lombard&#160;&#160;and the key of the cupboard to Blore.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You two are the strongest physically. It would be difficult for either of<br/>
&#160;you&#160;&#160;to get the key from the other. It would be impossible for any of us<br/>
&#160;three to do&#160;&#160;so. To break open the cupboard-or the plate chest-would be a<br/>
&#160;noisy and cumbrous&#160;&#160;proceeding and one which could hardly be carried out<br/>
&#160;without attention being&#160;&#160;attracted to what was going on.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused, then went on:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We are still faced by one very grave problem. What has become of Mr.<br/>
&#160;Lombard's&#160;&#160;revolver?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Seems to me its owner is the most likely person to know that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A white dint showed in Philip Lombard's nostrils. He said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=181></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;You damned pig-headed fool! I tell you it's been stolen from me.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Wargrave asked:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;When did you see it last?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Last night. It was in the drawer when I went to bed-ready in case anything<br/>
&#160;&#160;happened.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It must have been taken this morning during the confusion of searching for<br/>
&#160;&#160;Rogers or after his dead body was discovered.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;vi-,r,q ~,qiri-<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;308&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It must be hidden somewhere about the house. We must look for<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;P~<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave's finger was stroking his chin. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I doubt if our search will result in anything. Our murderer has had plenty<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;time to devise a hiding-place. I do not fancy we shall find that<br/>
&#160;revolver&#160;&#160;easily.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said forcefully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know where the revolver is, but I'll bet I know where something<br/>
&#160;else&#160;&#160;is-that hypodermic syringe. Follow me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He opened the front door and led the way round the house.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=182></a>&#160;&#160;A little distance away from the dining-room window he found the syringe.<br/>
&#160;Beside&#160;&#160;it was a smashed china figure-a fifth broken Indian boy.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said in a satisfied voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Only place it could be. After he'd killed her, he opened the window and<br/>
&#160;threw&#160;&#160;out the syringe and picked up the china figure from the table and<br/>
&#160;followed on&#160;&#160;with that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There were no prints on the syringe. It had been carefully wiped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said in a determined voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now let us look for the revolver.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;By all means. But in doing so let us be careful to keep together.<br/>
&#160;Remember, if&#160;&#160;we separate, the murderer gets his chance.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They. searched the house carefully from attic to cellars, but without<br/>
&#160;result. Ile&#160;&#160;revolver was still missing.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 13<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One of us . . . One of us . . . One of us . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Three words, endlessly repeated, dinning themselves hour after hour into<br/>
&#160;&#160;receptive brains.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Five people-five frightened people. Five people who watched each other, who<br/>
&#160;now&#160;&#160;hardly troubled to hide their state of nervous tension.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was little pretence now-no formal veneer of conversation. They were<br/>
&#160;five&#160;&#160;enemies linked together by a mutual instinct of selfpreservation.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And all of them, suddenly, looked less like human beings. They were<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=183></a>&#160;reverting to&#160;&#160;more bestial types. Like a wary old tortoise, Mr. Justice<br/>
&#160;Wargrave sat hunched&#160;&#160;up, his body motionless, his eyes keen<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;T~<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;and alert. Ex-Inspector Blore looked coarser and clumsier in build. His walk<br/>
&#160;was&#160;that of a slow padding animal. His eyes were bloodshot. There was a look<br/>
&#160;of&#160;mingled ferocity and stupidity about him. He was like a beast at bay<br/>
&#160;ready to&#160;charge its pursuers. Philip Lombard's senses seemed heightened,<br/>
&#160;rather than&#160;diminished. His ears reacted to the slightest sound. His step<br/>
&#160;was lighter and&#160;quicker, his body was lithe and graceful. And he smiled<br/>
&#160;often, his lips curling&#160;back from his long white teeth.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne was very quiet. She sat most of the time huddled in a<br/>
&#160;chair. Her&#160;&#160;eyes stared ahead of her into space. She looked dazed. She was<br/>
&#160;like a bird that&#160;&#160;has dashed its head against glass and that has been picked<br/>
&#160;up by a human hand.&#160;&#160;It crouches there, terrified, unable to move, hoping<br/>
&#160;to save itself by its&#160;&#160;immobility.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong was in a pitiable condition of nerves. He twitched and his hands<br/>
&#160;shook.&#160;&#160;He lighted cigarette after cigarette and stubbed them out almost<br/>
&#160;immediately. The&#160;&#160;forced inaction of their position seemed to gall him more<br/>
&#160;than the others. Every&#160;&#160;now and then he broke out into a torrent of nervous<br/>
&#160;speech.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We-we shouldn't just sit here doing nothing! There must be something-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=184></a>&#160;surely,&#160;&#160;surely, there is something that we can do? If we lit a bonfire-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said heavily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In this weather?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The rain was pouring down again. The wind came in fitful gusts. The<br/>
&#160;depressing&#160;&#160;sound of the pattering rain nearly drove them mad.<br/>
&#160;&#160;By tacit consent, they had adopted a plan of campaign. They all sat in the<br/>
&#160;big&#160;&#160;drawing-room. Only one person left the room at a time. The other four<br/>
&#160;waited till&#160;&#160;the fifth returned.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's only a question of time. The weather will clear. Then we can do&#160;<br/>
&#160;something-signal-light fires-make a raft-something!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said with a sudden cackle of laughter:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A question of time-time? We can't afford time! We shall all be dead. . .<br/>
&#160;.&#34;&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said, and his small clear voice was heavy with<br/>
&#160;passionate&#160;&#160;determination:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not if we are careful. We must be very careful.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The mid-day meal had been duly eaten-but there had been no conventional<br/>
&#160;formality&#160;&#160;about it. All five of them bad gone to the kitchen. In the larder<br/>
&#160;they had found&#160;&#160;a great store of tinned foods. They had opened a tin of<br/>
&#160;tongue and two tins of&#160;&#160;fruit. They had eaten standing round the kitchen<br/>
&#160;table. Then, herding close&#160;&#160;together, they<br/>
&#160;&#160;310<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;had returned to the drawing-room-to sit there-sit-watching each other. . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=185></a>&#160;.&#160;&#160;And by now the thoughts that ran through their brains were abnormal,<br/>
&#160;feverish,&#160;&#160;diseased. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's Armstrong . . . I saw him looking at me sideways just then<br/>
&#160;&#160;. his eyes are mad . . . quite mad . . . . Perhaps he isn't a doctor at<br/>
&#160;all. .&#160;&#160;. . That's it, of course! . . . He's a lunatic, escaped from some<br/>
&#160;doctor's&#160;&#160;house-pretending to be a doctor. . . . It's true . . . shall I<br/>
&#160;tell them? . .&#160;&#160;. Shall I scream out? . . . No, it won't do to put him on<br/>
&#160;his guard . . . .&#160;&#160;Besides he can seem so sane. . . . What time is it? . .<br/>
&#160;. Only a quarter past&#160;&#160;three! . . . Oh, God, I shall go mad myself . . . .<br/>
&#160;Yes, it's Armstrong . . .&#160;&#160;. He's watching me now. . 1)<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;They won't get me! I can take care of myself. . . . I've been in tight<br/>
&#160;places&#160;&#160;before. . . . Where the hell is that revolver? . . . Who took it?<br/>
&#160;. . . Who's got&#160;&#160;it? . . . Nobody's got it-we know that. We<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;were all searched. . . . Nobody can have it . . . . But some one knows where<br/>
&#160;it&#160;is. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;They're going mad . . . they'll all go mad . . . . Afraid of death<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. we're all afraid of death . . . I'm afraid of death. . . . Yes, but that<br/>
&#160;&#160;doesn't stop death coming. . . . 'The hearse is at the door, sir.' Where did<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;read that? The girl . . . I'll watch the girl. Yes, I'll watch the girl.<br/>
&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;&#160;&#34;Twenty to four . only twenty to four . . . perhaps the clock has<br/>
&#160;stopped. . .&#160;&#160;. I don't understand-no, I don't understand. . . . This sort<br/>
&#160;of thing can't&#160;&#160;happen . . . it is happening. . . . Why don't we wake up?<br/>
&#160;Wake up-4udgment&#160;&#160;Day-no, not that! If I could only think. . . . My head-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=186></a>&#160;something's happening in&#160;&#160;my head-it's going to burst-it's going to split.<br/>
&#160;. . . This sort of thing can't&#160;&#160;happen. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;What's the time? Oh, God! it's only a quarter to four.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I must keep my head . . . I must keep my head. . . . If only I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;keep my head . . . It's all perfectly clear-all worked out. But nobody must<br/>
&#160;suspect. It may do the trick. It must! Which one? That's the question-which<br/>
&#160;one?&#160;I think-yes, I rather think-yes-him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;When the clock struck five they all jumped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Does any one-want tea?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a moment's silence. Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'd like a cup.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera rose. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'll go and make it. You can all stay here.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said gently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I think, my dear young lady, we would all prefer to come and watch you<br/>
&#160;make&#160;&#160;it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera stared, then gave a short rather hysterical laugh.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course! You would!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Five people went into the kitchen. Tea was made and drunk by Vera and<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=187></a>&#160;Blore.&#160;&#160;The other three had whiskey-opening a fresh bottle and using a<br/>
&#160;siphon from a&#160;&#160;nailed up case.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The judge murmured with a reptilian smile:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We must be very careful. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They went back again to the drawing-room. Although it was summer the room<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;dark. Lombard switched on the lights but they did not come on. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course! The engine's not been run to-day since Rogers hasn't been there<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;see to it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He hesitated and said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We could go out and get it going, I suppose.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There are packets of candles in the larder, I saw them, better use those.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Lombard went out. The other four sat watching each other.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He came back with a box of candles and a pile of saucers. Five candles were<br/>
&#160;&#160;lit and placed about the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The time was a quarter to six.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;At twenty past six, Vera felt that to sit there longer was unbearable. She<br/>
&#160;would&#160;&#160;go to her room and bathe her aching head and temples in cold water.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She got up and went towards the door. Then she remembered and came back and<br/>
&#160;got&#160;&#160;a candle out of the box. She lighted it, let a little wax pour into a<br/>
&#160;saucer and&#160;&#160;stuck the candle firmly to it. Then she went out of the room,<br/>
&#160;shutting the door&#160;&#160;behind her and leaving the four men inside.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=188></a>&#160;&#160;She went up the stairs and along the passage to her room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As she opened her door, she suddenly halted and stood stock stiff.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Her nostrils quivered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The sea . . . The smell of the sea at St. Tredennick . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;That was it. She could not be mistaken. Of course one smelt the<br/>
&#160;&#160;312&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;sea on an island anyway, but this was different. It was the smell there had<br/>
&#160;been&#160;on the beach that day-with the tide out and the rocks covered with<br/>
&#160;seaweed drying&#160;in the sun.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Can I swim out to the island, Miss Claythorne?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why can't I swim out to the island?. . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Horrid whiny spoilt little brat! If it weren't for him, Hugo would be rich<br/>
&#160;. .&#160;&#160;. able to marry the girl he loved.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Hugo . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Surely-surely-Hugo was beside her? No, waiting for her in the room. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She made a step forward. The draught from the window caught the flame of the<br/>
&#160;&#160;candle. It flickered and went out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the dark she was suddenly afraid. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't be a fool,&#34; Vera Claythorne urged herself. &#34;It's all right. The<br/>
&#160;others are&#160;&#160;downstairs. All four of them. There's no one in the room. There<br/>
&#160;can't be. You're&#160;&#160;imagining things, my girl-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But that smell-that smell of the beach at St. Tredennick . . . that wasn't<br/>
&#160;&#160;imagined. It was true. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And there was some one in the room . . . . She had heard something-surely<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=189></a>&#160;she had&#160;&#160;heard something . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then, as she stood there, listening-a cold, clammy hand touched her<br/>
&#160;throat-a&#160;&#160;wet hand, smelling of the sea. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera screamed. She screamed and screamed-screams of the utmost terror-wild<br/>
&#160;&#160;desperate cries for help.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She did not hear the sounds from below, of a chair being overturned, of a<br/>
&#160;door&#160;&#160;opening, of men's feet running up the stairs. She was conscious only<br/>
&#160;of su&#160;&#160;preme terror.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then, restoring her sanity, lights flickered in the doorway-candles -men<br/>
&#160;&#160;hurrying into the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What the devil?&#34; &#34;What's happened?&#34; &#34;Good God, what is it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She shuddered, took a step forward, collapsed on the floor.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She was only half aware of some one bending over her, of some one forcing<br/>
&#160;her&#160;&#160;head down between her knees.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then at a sudden exclamation, a quick &#34;My God, look at that!&#34; her senses<br/>
&#160;&#160;returned. She opened her eyes and raised her head. She saw what it was the<br/>
&#160;men&#160;&#160;with the candles were looking at.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;A broad ribbon of wet seaweed was hanging down from the ceiling. It was<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=190></a>&#160;that&#160;&#160;which in the darkness had swayed against her throat. It was that which<br/>
&#160;she had&#160;&#160;taken for a clammy hand, a drowned hand come back from the dead to<br/>
&#160;squeeze the&#160;&#160;life out of her! . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She began to laugh hysterically. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It was seaweed-only seaweed-and that's what the smell was. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then the faintness came over her once more-waves upon waves of<br/>
&#160;sickness.&#160;&#160;Again some one took her head and forced it between her knees.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Aeons of time seemed to pass. They were offering her something to drink-<br/>
&#160;pressing&#160;&#160;the glass against her lips. She smelt brandy.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She was just about to gulp the spirit gratefully down when, suddenly, a<br/>
&#160;warning&#160;&#160;note-like an alarm bell-sounded in her brain. She sat up, pushing<br/>
&#160;the glass away.&#160;&#160;She said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Where did this come from?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore's voice answered. He stared a minute before speaking. He said:&#160;&#160;&#34;I<br/>
&#160;got it from downstairs.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I won't drink it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a moment's silence, then Lombard laughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said with appreciation:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Good for you, Vera! You've got your wits about you-even if you have been<br/>
&#160;scared&#160;&#160;half out of your life. I'll get a fresh bottle that hasn't been<br/>
&#160;opened.&#34;&#160;&#160;He went swiftly out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said uncertainly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm all right now. I'll have some water.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong supported her as she strug led to her feet. She went<br/>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;C19<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=191></a>&#160;&#160;over to the basin, swaying and clutching at him for support. She let the<br/>
&#160;cold&#160;tap run and then filled the glass. Blore said resentfully: &#34;That<br/>
&#160;brandy's all&#160;right.&#34; Armstrong said: &#34;How do you know?&#34; Blore said angrily:<br/>
&#160;&#34;I didn't put&#160;anything in it. That's what you're getting at, I suppose.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>&#160;&#160;314&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm not saying you did. You might have done it, or some one might have<br/>
&#160;tampered&#160;&#160;with the bottle for just this emergency.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard came swiftly back into the room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He had a new bottle of brandy in his hands and a corkscrew.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thrust the sealed bottle under Vera's nose.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There you are, my girl. Absolutely no deception.&#34; He peeled off the tin<br/>
&#160;foil and&#160;&#160;drew the cork. &#34;Lucky there's a good supply of spirits in the<br/>
&#160;house. Thoughtful&#160;&#160;of U. N. Owen.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera shuddered violently.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong held the glass while Philip poured the brandy into it, He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'd better drink this, Miss Claythorne. You've had a nasty shock.&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera<br/>
&#160;drank a little of the spirit. The colour came back to her face. Philip&#160;<br/>
&#160;Lombard said with a laugh:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, here's one murder that hasn't gone according to plan!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said almost in a whisper:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You think-that was what was meant?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Expected you to pass out through fright! Some people would have, wouldn't<br/>
&#160;they,&#160;&#160;doctor.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=192></a>&#160;&#160;Armstrong did not commit himself. He said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;H'm, impossible to say. Young healthy subject-no cardiac weakness.<br/>
&#160;Unlikely. On&#160;&#160;the other hand-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He picked up the glass of brandy that Blore had brought. He dipped a finger<br/>
&#160;in&#160;&#160;it, tasted it gingerly. His expression did not alter. He said dubiously:<br/>
&#160;&#34;H'm,&#160;&#160;tastes all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore stepped forward angrily. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If you're saying that I tampered with that, I'll knock your ruddy block<br/>
&#160;off.&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera, her wits revived by the brandy, made a diversion by saying:<br/>
&#160;&#34;Where's the&#160;&#160;judge?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The three men looked at each other.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's odd . . . . Thought he came up with us.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So did I. . . . What about it, doctor? You came up the stairs behind me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I thought he was following me. . . . Of course, he'd be bound to go slower<br/>
&#160;than&#160;&#160;we did. He's an old man.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They looked at each other again.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's damned odd.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We must look for him.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=193></a>&#160;&#160;He started for the door. The others followed him3 Vera last.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As they went down the stairs Armstrong said over his shoulder:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course he may have stayed in the living-room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They crossed the hall. Armstrong called out loudly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Wargrave, Wargrave, where are you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was no answer. A deadly silence filled the house apart from the<br/>
&#160;gentle&#160;&#160;patter of the rain.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then, in the entrance to the drawing-room door, Armstrong stopped dead. The<br/>
&#160;&#160;others crowded up and looked over his shoulder.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Somebody cried out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Mr. Justice Wargrave was sitting in his high-backed chair at the end of the<br/>
&#160;room.&#160;&#160;Two candles burnt on either side of him. But what shocked and<br/>
&#160;startled the&#160;&#160;onlookers was the fact that he sat there robed in scarlet with<br/>
&#160;a judge's wig upon&#160;&#160;his head. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong motioned to the others to keep back. He himself walked across<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;the silent staring figure, reeling a little as he walked like a drunken<br/>
&#160;man.&#160;&#160;He bent forward, peering into the still face. Then, with a swift<br/>
&#160;movement, he&#160;&#160;raised the wig. It fell to the floor, revealing the high bald<br/>
&#160;forehead with, in&#160;&#160;the very middle, a round stained mark from which<br/>
&#160;something had trickled. . . .&#160;&#160;Dr. Armstrong raised the limp hand and felt<br/>
&#160;for the pulse. Then he turned to the&#160;&#160;others.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said-and his voice was expressionless, dead, far away:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He's been shot.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;God-the revolver!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The doctor said, still in the same lifeless voice:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=194></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Got him through the head. Instantaneous.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera stooped to the wig. She said, and her voice shook with horror:&#160;&#34;Miss<br/>
&#160;Brent's missing grey wool.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And the scarlet curtain that was missing from the bathroom. . . &#34;&#160;Vera<br/>
&#160;whispered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So this is what they wanted them for.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Suddenly Philip Lombard laughed-a high unnatural laugh.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;'Five little Indian boys going in for law; one got in Chancery and<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160; &#160;I I<br/>
&#160;&#160;. ..<br/>
&#160;&#160;316&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;then there were four.' That's the end of Mr. Bloody Justice Wargrave. No<br/>
&#160;more&#160;pronouncing sentence for him! No more putting on of the black cap!<br/>
&#160;Here's the&#160;last time he'll ever sit in court! No more summing up and sending<br/>
&#160;innocent men&#160;to death. How Edward Seton would laugh if he were here! God,<br/>
&#160;how he'd laugh!&#34;&#160;His outburst shocked and startled the others. Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#34;Only this morning&#160;you said he was the one!&#34; Philip Lombard's face changed-<br/>
&#160;sobered. He said in a&#160;low voice: &#34;I know I did. . . . Well, I was wrong.<br/>
&#160;Heres one more of us who's&#160;been proved innocent-too late!&#34;<br/>

&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 14<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=195></a>&#160;&#160;THEY HAD CARRIED Mr. Justice Wargrave up to his room and laid him on the<br/>
&#160;bed.&#160;&#160;Then they had come down again and had stood in the hall looking at<br/>
&#160;each other.&#160;Blore said heavily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What do we do now?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said briskly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Have something to eat. We've got to eat, you know.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Once again they went into the kitchen. Again they opened a tin of tongue.<br/>
&#160;They&#160;&#160;ate mechanically, almost without tasting.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I shall never eat tongue again.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They finished the meal. They sat round the kitchen table staring at each<br/>
&#160;&#160;other.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Only four of us now. . . . Who'll be the next?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong stared. He said, almost mechanically:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We must be very careful-&#34; and stopped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's what he said. . . . And now he's dead!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;How did it happen, I wonder?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard swore. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A damned clever double cross! That stuff was planted in Miss<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=196></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Claythorne's room and it worked just as it was intended to. Every one dashes<br/>
&#160;up&#160;there thinking she's being murdered. And so-in the confusion-some one-<br/>
&#160;caught&#160;the old boy off his guard.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why didn't any one hear the shot?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard shook his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Miss Claythorne was screaming, the wind was howling, we were running about<br/>
&#160;&#160;and calling out. No, it wouldn't be heard.&#34; He paused. &#34;But that trick's not<br/>
&#160;&#160;going to work again. He'll have to try something else next time.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He probably will.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was an unpleasant tone in his voice. The two men eyed each other.<br/>
&#160;Armstrong said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Four of us, and we don't know which.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;it<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I know. . . . Vera said: &#34;I haven't the least doubt. Armstrong said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#34;I suppose I do know really. Philip Lombard said: &#34;I think I've got a pretty<br/>
&#160;good idea now . . . Again they all looked at each other . . . . Vera<br/>
&#160;staggered&#160;to her feet. She said: &#34;I feel awful. I must go to bed. . . . I'm<br/>
&#160;dead beat.&#34;&#160;Lombard said: &#34;Might as well. No good sitting watching each<br/>
&#160;other.&#34; Blore&#160;said: &#34;I've no objection . . . ... The doctor murmured: &#34;The<br/>
&#160;best thing to&#160;do-although I doubt if any of us will sleep.&#34; They moved to<br/>
&#160;the door. Blore&#160;said: &#34;I wonder where that revolver is now?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=197></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;11<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They went up the stairs. The next move was a little like a scene in a farce.<br/>
&#160;&#160;318&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Each one of the four stood with a hand on his or her bedroom door handle.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then, as though at a signal, each one stepped into the room and pulled the<br/>
&#160;&#160;door shut. There were sounds of bolts and locks, of the moving of furniture.<br/>
&#160;Four frightened people were barricaded in until morning.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard drew a breath of relief as he turned from adjusting a chair<br/>
&#160;under&#160;&#160;the door handle.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He strolled across to the dressing-table.<br/>
&#160;&#160;By the light of the flickering candle he studied his face curiously. He<br/>
&#160;said&#160;&#160;softly to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, this business has got you rattled all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His sudden wolf-like smile flashed out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He undressed quickly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He went over to the bed, placing his wrist-watch on the table by the bed.<br/>
&#160;Then he opened the drawer of the table.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He stood there, staring down at the revolver that was inside<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=198></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;it . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera Claythorne lay in bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The candle still burned beside her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As yet she could not summon the courage to put it out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She was afraid of the dark. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She told herself again and again: &#34;You're all right until morning. Nothing<br/>
&#160;&#160;happened last night. Nothing will happen to-night. Nothing can happen.<br/>
&#160;You're&#160;&#160;locked and bolted in. No one can come near you. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;And she thought suddenly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course! I can stay here! Stay here locked in! Food doesn't really<br/>
&#160;matter! I&#160;&#160;can stay here-safely-till help comes! Even if it's a day -or two<br/>
&#160;days. . . .&#34;&#160;&#160;Stay here. Yes, but could she stay here? Hour after hour-with<br/>
&#160;no one to speak to,&#160;&#160;with nothing to do but think. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She'd begin to think of Cornwall-of Hugo-of-of what she'd said to Cyril.<br/>
&#160;Horrid whiny little boy, always pestering her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Miss Claythorne, why can't I swim out to the rock? I can. I know I can.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Was it her voice that had answered?<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course you can, Cyril, really. I know that.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=199></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Can I go then, Miss Claythorne?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, you see, Cyril, your mother gets so nervous about you. I'll tell you<br/>
&#160;what.&#160;&#160;To-morrow you can swim out to the rock. I'll talk to your mother on<br/>
&#160;the beach and&#160;&#160;distract her attention. And then, when she looks for you,<br/>
&#160;there you'll be&#160;&#160;standing on the rock waving to her! It will be a surprise!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ob, good egg, Miss Claythorne! That will be a lark!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She'd said it now. To-morrow! Hugo was going to Newquay. When he came back-<br/>
&#160;it&#160;&#160;would be all over.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Yes, but supposing it wasn't? Supposing it went wrong? Cyril might be<br/>
&#160;rescued in&#160;&#160;time. And then-then he'd say, &#34;Miss Claythorne said I could.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Well, what of it?&#160;&#160;One must take some risk! If the worst happened she'd<br/>
&#160;brazen it out. &#34;How can you&#160;&#160;tell such a wicked lie, Cyril? Of course I<br/>
&#160;never said any such thing!&#34; They'd&#160;&#160;believe her all right. Cyril often told<br/>
&#160;stories. He was an untruthful child.&#160;&#160;Cyril would know, of course. But that<br/>
&#160;didn't matter. . . . And anyway nothing&#160;&#160;would go wrong. She'd pretend to<br/>
&#160;swim out after him. But she'd arrive too late.&#160;&#160;. . . Nobody would ever<br/>
&#160;suspect. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Had Hugo suspected? Was that why he had looked at her in that queer far-off<br/>
&#160;way.&#160;&#160;. . ?Had Hugo known?<br/>
&#160;&#160;Was that why he had gone off after the inquest so hurriedly?<br/>
&#160;&#160;He hadn't answered the one letter she had written to him. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Hugo . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera turned restlessly in bed. No, no, she mustn't think of Hugo. It hurt<br/>
&#160;too&#160;&#160;much! That was all over, over and done with.<br/>
&#160;&#160;must be forgotten. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Why, this evening, had she suddenly felt that Hugo was in the room with<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=200></a>&#160;her?&#160;&#160;She stared up at the ceiling, stared at the big black hook in the<br/>
&#160;middle of the&#160;&#160;room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She'd never noticed that hook before.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The seaweed had hung from that. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She shivered as she remembered that cold clammy touch on her neck. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;-1<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;f<br/>
&#160;i<br/>
&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;. . . Hugo<br/>
&#160;&#160;320&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She didn't like that hook on the ceiling. It drew your eyes, fascinated you<br/>
&#160;.&#160;&#160;. . a big black hook. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;5<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Ex-Inspector Blore sat on the side of his bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;His small eyes, red-rimmed and bloodshot, were alert in the solid mass of<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=201></a>&#160;his&#160;&#160;face. He was like a wild boar waiting to charge.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He felt no inclination to sleep.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The menace was coming very near now. . . . Six out of ten!<br/>
&#160;&#160;For all his sagacity, for all his caution and astuteness, the old judge had<br/>
&#160;gone&#160;&#160;the way of the rest.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore snorted with a kind of savage satisfaction.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What was it the old geezer had said?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We must be very careful. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Self-righteous smug old hypocrite. Sitting up in court feeling like<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;God Almighty. He'd got his all right. . . . No more being careful for him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And now there were four of them. The girl, Lombard, Armstrong and himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Very soon another of them would go. . . . But it wouldn't be William Henry<br/>
&#160;Blore.&#160;&#160;He'd see to that all right.<br/>
&#160;&#160;(But the revolver. . . . What about the revolver? That was the disturbing<br/>
&#160;&#160;factor-the revolver!)<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore sat on his bed, his brow furrowed, his little eyes creased and<br/>
&#160;puckered&#160;&#160;while he pondered the problem of the revolver. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the silence he could hear the clocks strike downstairs.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Midnight.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He relaxed a little now-even went so far as to lie down on his bed. But he<br/>
&#160;did&#160;&#160;not undress.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He lay there, thinking. Going over the whole business from the beginning,<br/>
&#160;&#160;methodically, painstakingly, as he had been wont to do in his police officer<br/>
&#160;&#160;days. It was thoroughness that paid in the end.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=202></a>&#160;&#160;The candle was burning down. Looking to see if the matches were within easy<br/>
&#160;reach&#160;&#160;of his hand, he blew it out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Strangely enough, he found the darkness disquieting. It was as though a<br/>
&#160;thousand&#160;&#160;age-old fears awoke and struggled for supremacy in his brain.<br/>
&#160;Faces floated in&#160;&#160;the air-the judge's face crowned with that mockery of grey<br/>
&#160;wool-the cold dead&#160;&#160;face of Mrs. Rogers-the convulsed purple face of Anthony<br/>
&#160;Marston. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;321<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Another face-pale, spectacled, with a small straw-coloured moustache. . .<br/>
&#160;.&#160;&#160;A face he had seen sometime or other-but when? Not on the island. No,<br/>
&#160;much&#160;&#160;longer ago than that.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Funny, that he couldn't put a name to it. really-fellow looked a bit of a<br/>
&#160;mug.&#160;Of course!<br/>
&#160;&#160;It came to him with a real shock.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Landor!<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. Silly sort of f ace<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Odd to think he'd completely forgotten what Landor looked like. Only<br/>
&#160;yesterday&#160;&#160;he'd been trying to recall the fellow's face, and hadn't been<br/>
&#160;able to.&#160;&#160;And now here it was, every feature clear and distinct, as though<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=203></a>&#160;he had seen it&#160;&#160;only yesterday. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Landor had had a wife-a thin slip of a woman with a worried face. There'd<br/>
&#160;been&#160;&#160;a kid too, a girl about fourteen. For the first time, he wondered what<br/>
&#160;had become&#160;&#160;of them.<br/>
&#160;&#160;(The revolver. What had become of the revolver? That was much<br/>
&#160;&#160;more important . . . . )<br/>
&#160;&#160;The more he thought about it the more puzzled he was.He<br/>
&#160;&#160;didn't understand this revolver business. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Somebody in the house had got that revolver. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Downstairs a clock struck one.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore's thoughts were cut short. He sat up on the bed, suddenly alert. For<br/>
&#160;he had&#160;&#160;heard a sound-a very faint sound-somewhere outside his bedroom door.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was some one moving about in the darkened house.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The perspiration broke out on his forehead. Who was it, moving secretly and<br/>
&#160;&#160;silently along the corridors? Some one who was up to no good, he'd bet that!<br/>
&#160;&#160;Noiselessly, in spite of his heavy build, he dropped off the bed and with<br/>
&#160;two&#160;&#160;strides was standing by the door listening.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;But the sound did not come again. Nevertheless Blore was convinced that he<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;not mistaken. He had heard a footfall just outside his door. The hair<br/>
&#160;rose&#160;&#160;slightly on his scalp. He knew fear again. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Some one creeping about stealthily in the night<br/>
&#160;&#160;He listened-but the sound was not repeated.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And now a new temptation assailed him. He wanted, desperately, to go out<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;investigate. If he could only see who it was prowling about in the<br/>
&#160;darkness.&#160;But to open his door would be the action of a fool. Very likely<br/>
&#160;that<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=204></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. ..<br/>
&#160;&#160;322&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;was exactly what the other was waiting for. He might even have meant Blore<br/>
&#160;to hear&#160;what he had heard, counting on him coming out to investigate.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore stood rigid-listening. He could hear sounds everywhere now, cracks,<br/>
&#160;&#160;rustles, mysterious whispers-but his dogged realistic brain knew them for<br/>
&#160;what&#160;&#160;they were-the creations of his own heated imagination.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then suddenly he heard something that was not imagination. Footsteps,<br/>
&#160;very&#160;&#160;soft, very cautious, but plainly audible to a ma,n listening with all<br/>
&#160;his ears&#160;&#160;as Blore was listening.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They came softly along the corridor (both Lombard's and Armstrong's rooms<br/>
&#160;were&#160;&#160;further from the stair-head than his). They passed his door without<br/>
&#160;hesitating&#160;&#160;or faltering.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And as they did so, Blore made up his mind.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He meant to see who it was! The footsteps had definitely passed his door<br/>
&#160;going&#160;&#160;to the stairs. Where was the man going?<br/>
&#160;&#160;When Blore acted, he acted quickly, surprisingly so for a man who looked<br/>
&#160;so heavy&#160;&#160;and slow. He tiptoed back to the bed, slipped matches into his<br/>
&#160;pocket, detached&#160;&#160;the plug of the electric lamp by his bed, and picked it<br/>
&#160;up winding the flex round&#160;&#160;it. It was a chromium affair with a heavy ebonite<br/>
&#160;base-a useful weapon.&#160;&#160;He sprinted noiselessly across the room, removed the<br/>
&#160;chair from under the door&#160;&#160;handle and with precaution unlocked and unbolted<br/>
&#160;the door. He stepped out into&#160;&#160;the corridor. There was a faint sound in the<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=205></a>&#160;hall below. Blore ran noiselessly&#160;&#160;in his stockinged feet to the head of the<br/>
&#160;stairs.<br/>
&#160;&#160;At that moment he realized why it was he had heard all these sounds so<br/>
&#160;clearly.&#160;&#160;The wind had died down completely and the sky must have cleared.<br/>
&#160;There was faint&#160;&#160;moonlight coming in through the landing window and it<br/>
&#160;illuminated the hall below.&#160;&#160;Blore had an instantaneous glimpse of a figure<br/>
&#160;just passing out through the front&#160;&#160;door.<br/>
&#160;&#160;In the act of running down the stairs in pursuit, he paused.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Once again, he had nearly made a fool of himself! This was a trap, perhaps,<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;lure him out of the house!<br/>
&#160;&#160;But what the other man didn't realize was that he had made a mistake, had<br/>
&#160;&#160;delivered himself neatly into Blore's hands.<br/>
&#160;&#160;For, of the three tenanted rooms upstairs, one must now be empty. All that<br/>
&#160;had&#160;&#160;to be done was to ascertain which!<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore went swiftly back along the corridor.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused first at Dr. Armstrong's door and tapped. There was no answer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He waited a minute, then went on to Philip Lombard's room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Here the answer came at once.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Who's there?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's Blore. I don't think Armstrong is in his room. Wait a minute. &#34;&#160;&#160;He<br/>
&#160;went on to the door at the end of the corridor. Here he tapped again.&#160;&#160;&#34;Miss<br/>
&#160;Claythorne. Miss Claythorne.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera's voice, startled, answered him.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=206></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Who is it? What's the matter?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's all right, Miss Claythorne. Wait a minute. I'll come back.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He raced back to Lombard's room. The door opened as he did so. Lombard<br/>
&#160;stood&#160;&#160;there. He held a candle in his left hand. He had pulled on his<br/>
&#160;trousers over his&#160;&#160;pyjamas. His right hand rested in the pocket of his<br/>
&#160;pyjama jacket. He said&#160;&#160;sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What the hell's all this?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore explained rapidly. Lombard's eyes lit up.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Armstrong-eh? So he's our pigeon!&#34; He moved along to Armstrong's door.<br/>
&#160;&#34;Sorry,&#160;&#160;Blore, but I don't take anything on trust.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He rapped sharply on the panel.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Armstrong-Armstrong.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was no answer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard dropped to his knees and peered through the keyhole. He inserted<br/>
&#160;his&#160;&#160;little finger gingerly into the lock.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Key's not in the door on the inside.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That means he locked it on the outside and took it with him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip nodded:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ordinary precaution to take. We'll get him, Blore. . . . This time, we'll<br/>
&#160;get&#160;&#160;him! Half a second.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He raced along to Vera's room.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Vera.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=207></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;We're hunting Armstrong. He's out of his room. Whatever you do, don't open<br/>
&#160;your&#160;&#160;door. Understand?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, I understand.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If Armstrong comes along and says that I've been killed, or Blore's been<br/>
&#160;killed,&#160;&#160;pay no attention. See? Only open your door if both Blore and I<br/>
&#160;speak to you. Got&#160;&#160;that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes. I'm not a complete fool.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;324&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Good.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He joined Blore. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And now-after him! The hunt's up!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We'd better be careful. He's got a revolver, remember.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard racing down the stairs chuckled.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's where you're wrong.&#34; He undid the front door, remarking: &#34;Latch<br/>
&#160;pushed&#160;&#160;back-so that he could get in again easily.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He went on:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've got that revolver!&#34; He took it half out of his pocket as he spoke.<br/>
&#160;&#34;Found&#160;&#160;it put back in my drawer to-night.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore stopped dead on the doorstep. His face changed. Philip Lombard saw<br/>
&#160;it.&#160;He said impatiently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't be a damned fool, Blore! I'm not going to shoot you! Go back and<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=208></a>&#160;barricade&#160;&#160;yourself in if you like! I'm off after Armstrong.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He started off into the moonlight. Blore, after a minute's hesitation,<br/>
&#160;followed&#160;&#160;him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He thought to himself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I suppose I'm asking for it. But after all-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;After all he had tackled criminals armed with revolvers before now.<br/>
&#160;Whatever else&#160;&#160;he lacked, Blore did not lack courage. Show him the danger<br/>
&#160;and he would tackle&#160;&#160;it pluckily. He was not afraid of danger in the open,<br/>
&#160;only of danger undefined&#160;&#160;and tinged with the supernatural.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;6<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera, left to wait results, got up and dressed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She glanced over once or twice at the door. It was a good solid door. It<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;both bolted and locked and had an oak chair wedged under the handle.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It could not be broken open by force. Certainly not by Dr. Armstrong. He was<br/>
&#160;&#160;not a physically powerful man.<br/>
&#160;&#160;If she were Armstrong intent on murder, it was cunning that she would<br/>
&#160;employ,&#160;&#160;not force.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Slie amused herself by reflecting on the means he might employ.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He might, as Philip had suggested, announce that one of the other<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;two men was dead. Or he might possibly pretend to be mortally wounded<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=209></a>&#160;himself,&#160;might drag himself groaning to her door.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There were other possibilities. He might inform her that the house was on<br/>
&#160;fire.&#160;&#160;More, he might actually set the house on fire. . . . Yes, that would<br/>
&#160;be a&#160;&#160;possibility. Lure the other two men out of the house, then, having<br/>
&#160;previously&#160;&#160;laid a trail of petrol, he might set fight to it. And she, like<br/>
&#160;an idiot, would&#160;&#160;remain barricaded in her room until it was too late.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She crossed over to the window. Not too bad. At a pinch one could escape<br/>
&#160;that&#160;&#160;way. It would mean a drop-but there was a handy flower-bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She sat down and picking up her diary began to write in it in a clear<br/>
&#160;flowing&#160;&#160;hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;One must pass the time.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Suddenly she stiffened to attention. She had heard a sound. It was, she<br/>
&#160;thought,&#160;&#160;a sound like breaking glass. And it came from somewhere<br/>
&#160;downstairs.&#160;She listened hard, but the sound was not repeated.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She heard, or thought she heard, stealthy sounds of footsteps, the creak<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;stairs, the rustle of garments-but there was nothing definite and she<br/>
&#160;concluded,&#160;&#160;as Blore had done earlier, that such sounds Q their origin in<br/>
&#160;her own&#160;&#160;imagination.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But presently she heard sounds of a more concrete nature. People moving<br/>
&#160;about&#160;&#160;downstairs-the murmur of voices. Then the very decided sound of some<br/>
&#160;one mounting&#160;&#160;the stairs-doors opening and shutting-feet going up to the<br/>
&#160;attic overhead. More&#160;&#160;noises from there.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Finally the steps came along the passage. Lombard's voice said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Vera? You all right?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes. What's happened?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore's voice said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=210></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Will you let us in?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera went to the door. She removed the chair, unlocked the door and slid<br/>
&#160;back the&#160;&#160;bolt. She opened the door. The two men were breathing hard, their<br/>
&#160;feet and the&#160;&#160;bottom of their trousers were soaking wet.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said again:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's happened?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Arnutrong's disappeared.<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;7<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried: &#34;What?&#34; Lombard said: &#34;Vanished clean off the island.&#34; Blore<br/>
&#160;concurred: &#34;Vanished-that's the word! Like some damned conjuring trick.&#34; Vera<br/>
&#160;said impatiently: &#34;Nonsense! He's hiding somewhere!&#34; Blore said: &#34;No, he<br/>
&#160;isn't!&#160;I tell you, there's nowhere to hide on this island. It s as bare as<br/>
&#160;your hand!&#160;There's moonlight outside. As clear as day it is. And he's not<br/>
&#160;to be found.&#34;&#160;Vera said: &#34;He doubled back into the house.&#34; Blore said: &#34;We<br/>
&#160;thought of that.&#160;We've searched the house too. You must have heard us. He's<br/>
&#160;not here, I tell&#160;you. He's gone-clean vanished, vamoosed. . . .&#34; Vera said<br/>
&#160;incredulously: &#34;I&#160;don't believe it.&#34; Lombard said: &#34;It's true, my dear.&#34; He<br/>
&#160;paused and then said:&#160;&#34;There's one other little fact. A pane in the dining-<br/>
&#160;room window has been&#160;smashed-and there are only three little Indian boys on<br/>
&#160;the table.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=211></a>&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 15<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;THREE PEOPLE sat eating breakfast in the kitchen.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Outside, the sun shone. It was a lovely day. The storm was a thing of the<br/>
&#160;&#160;past.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And with the change in the weather, a change had come in the mood of the<br/>
&#160;&#160;prisoners on the island.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;A<br/>
&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;if<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;327<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They felt now like people just awakening from a nightmare. There was<br/>
&#160;danger, yes,&#160;&#160;but it was danger in daylight. That paralyzing atmosphere of<br/>
&#160;fear that had&#160;&#160;wrapped them round like a blanket yesterday while the wind<br/>
&#160;howled outside was&#160;&#160;gone.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We'll try heliographing to-day with a mirror from the highest point of the<br/>
&#160;&#160;island. Some bright lad wandering on the cliff win recognize S 0 S when he<br/>
&#160;sees&#160;&#160;it, I hope. In the evening we could try a bonfire-only there isn't<br/>
&#160;much wood-and&#160;&#160;anyway they might just think it was song and dance and<br/>
&#160;merriment.&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=212></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Surely some one can read Morse. And then they'll come to take us off. Long<br/>
&#160;&#160;before this evening.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The weather's cleared all right, but the sea hasn't gone down yet.<br/>
&#160;Terrific&#160;&#160;swell on! They won't be able to get a boat near the island before<br/>
&#160;to-morrow.&#34;&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Another night in this place!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;May as well face it! Twenty-four hours will do it, I think. If we can last<br/>
&#160;out&#160;&#160;that, we'll be all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore cleared his throat. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We'd better come to a clear understanding. What's happened to Armstrong?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, we've got one piece of evidence. Only three little Indian boys left<br/>
&#160;on the&#160;&#160;dinner-table. It looks as though Armstrong had got his quietus.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Then why haven't you found his dead body?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Exactly.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard shook his head. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's damned odd-no getting over it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said doubtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It might have been thrown into the sea.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;By whom? You? Me? You saw him go out of the front door. You come along and<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=213></a>&#160;find&#160;&#160;me in my room. We go out and search together. When the devil had I<br/>
&#160;time to kill&#160;&#160;him and carry his body round the island?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;328&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know. But I do know one thing.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The revolver. It was your revolver. It's in your possession now, There's<br/>
&#160;nothing&#160;&#160;to show that it hasn't been in your possession an along.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Come now, Blore, we were all searched.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, you'd hidden it away before that happened. Afterwards you just took<br/>
&#160;it back&#160;&#160;again.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My good blockhead, I swear to you that it was put back in my drawer.<br/>
&#160;Greatest&#160;&#160;surprise I ever had in my life when I found it there.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You ask us to believe a thing like that! Why the devil should Armstrong,<br/>
&#160;or any&#160;&#160;one else for that matter, put it back?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard raised his shoulders hopelessly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I haven't the least idea. It's just crazy. The last thing one would<br/>
&#160;expect.&#160;&#160;There seems no point in it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore agreed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, there isn't. You might have thought of a better story.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Rather proof that I'm telling the truth, isn't it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't look at it that way.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=214></a>&#160;&#160;Philip said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You wouldn't.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Look here, Mr. Lombard, if you're an honest man, as you pretend-&#34;&#160;Philip<br/>
&#160;murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;When did I lay claims to being an honest man? No, indeed, I never said<br/>
&#160;that.&#34;&#160;Blore went on stolidly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If you're speaking the truth-there's only one thing to be done. As long<br/>
&#160;as you&#160;&#160;have that revolver, Miss Claythorne and I are at your mercy. The<br/>
&#160;only fair thing&#160;&#160;is to put that revolver with the other things that are<br/>
&#160;locked up-and you and I&#160;&#160;will hold the two keys still.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard lit a cigarette.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As he puffed smoke, he said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't be an ass.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;i<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, I won't. That revolver's mine. I need it to defend myself-and I'm<br/>
&#160;going&#160;&#160;to keep it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In that case we're bound to come to one conclusion.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=215></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;That I'm U. N. Owen? Think what you damned well please. But I'll ask you,<br/>
&#160;if&#160;&#160;that's so, why I didn't pot you with the revolver last night? I could<br/>
&#160;have,&#160;&#160;about twenty times over.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore shook his head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't know-and that's a fact. You must have had some reason.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera had taken no part in the discussion. She stirred now and said:&#160;&#34;I<br/>
&#160;think you're both behaving like a pair of idiots.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard looked at her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's this?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You've forgotten the nursery rhyme. Don't you see there's a clue there?&#34;<br/>
&#160;She recited in a meaning voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and<br/>
&#160;then&#160;there were three.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She went on:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A red herring-that's the vital clue. Arnutrong's not dead. He took away<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;china Indian to make you think he was. You may say what you like-<br/>
&#160;Armstrong's&#160;&#160;on the island still. His disappearance is just a red herring<br/>
&#160;across the track.&#160;Lombard sat down again.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You know, you may be right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, but if so, where is he? We've searched the place. Outside and<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=216></a>&#160;inside.&#34;&#160;Vera said scornfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We all searched for the revolver, didn't we, and couldn't find it? But it<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;somewhere all the time!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard murmured:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;nere's a slight difference in size, my dear, between a man and a<br/>
&#160;revolver.&#34;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I don't care-I'm sure I'm right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;330&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Rather giving himself away, wasn't it? Actually mentioning a red herring<br/>
&#160;in&#160;&#160;the verse. He could have written it, up a bit different.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But don't you see, he's mad? It's all mad! The whole thing of going by the<br/>
&#160;&#160;rhyme is mad! Dressing up the judge, killing Rogers when he was chopping&#160;<br/>
&#160;sticks-drugging Mrs. Rogers so that she overslept herself-arranging for a&#160;<br/>
&#160;bumblebee when Miss Brent died! It's like some horrible child playing a game.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It's all got to fit in.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, you're right.&#34; He thought a minute. &#34;At any rate there's no Zoo on<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;island. He'll have a bit of trouble getting over that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't you see? We're the Zoo . . . . Last night, we were hardly human any<br/>
&#160;&#160;more. We're the Zoo . . . ...<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=217></a>&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They spent the morning on the cliffs, taking it in turns to flash a mirror<br/>
&#160;at&#160;&#160;the mainland.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There were no signs that any one saw them. No answering signals. The day<br/>
&#160;was&#160;&#160;fine, with a slight haze. Below the sea heaved in a gigantic swell.<br/>
&#160;There were&#160;&#160;no boats out.<br/>
&#160;&#160;They had made another abortive search of the island. There was no trace of<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;missing physician.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera looked up at the house from where they were standing.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said, her breath coming with a slight catch in it:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One feels safer here, out in the open. . . . Don't let's go back into the<br/>
&#160;&#160;house again.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not a bad idea. We're pretty safe here, no one can get at us without our<br/>
&#160;&#160;seeing him a long time beforehand.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We'll stay here.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Have to pass the night somewhere. We'll have to go back to the house<br/>
&#160;then.&#34;&#160;Vera shuddered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I can't bear it. I can't go through another night!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'll be safe enough-locked in your room.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=218></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera murmured: &#34;I suppose so.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She stretched out her hands, murmuring:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's lovely-to feel the sun again.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;How odd . . . . I'm almost happy. And yet I suppose I'm actually in danger<br/>
&#160;. .&#160;&#160;. . Somehow-now-nothing seems to matter<br/>
&#160;&#160;not in daylight . . . . I feel full of power-I feel that I can't die.&#160;Blore<br/>
&#160;was looking at his wrist-watch. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's two o'clock. What about lunch?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said obstinately:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm not going back to the house. I'm going to stay here-in the open.&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;Oh, come now, Miss Claythorne. Got to keep your strength up, you know.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If I even see a tinned tongue, I shall be sick! I don't want any food.<br/>
&#160;People&#160;&#160;go days on end with nothing sometimes when they're on a diet.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, I need my meals regular. What about you, Mr. Lombard?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You know, I don't relish the idea of tinned tongue particularly. I'll stay<br/>
&#160;here&#160;&#160;with Miss Claythorne.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore hesitated. Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I shall be quite all right. I don't think he'll shoot me as soon as your<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=219></a>&#160;back&#160;&#160;is turned if that's what you're afraid of.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's all right if you say so. But we agreed we ought not to separate. &#34;<br/>
&#160;Philip said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're the one who wants to go into the lion's den. I'll come with you if<br/>
&#160;you&#160;&#160;like?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, you won't,&#34; said Blore. &#34;You'll stay here.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip laughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So you're still afraid of me? Why, I could shoot you both this very minute<br/>
&#160;if&#160;&#160;I liked.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, but that wouldn't be according to plan. It's one at a time, and it's<br/>
&#160;got&#160;&#160;to be done in a certain way.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well,&#34; said Philip, &#34;you seem to know all about it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Of course,&#34; said Blore, &#34;it's a bit jumpy going up to the house alone-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip said softly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And therefore, will I tend you my revolver? Answer, no, I will not! Not<br/>
&#160;quite&#160;&#160;so simple as that, thank you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Blore shrugged his shoulders and began to make his way up the steep slope<br/>
&#160;to the&#160;&#160;house.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=220></a>&#160;&#160;Lombard said softly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Feeding time at the Zoo! The animals are very regular in their habits!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said anxiously:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Isn't it very risky, what he's doing?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In the sense you mean-no, I don't think it is! Armstrong's not armed, you<br/>
&#160;know,&#160;&#160;and anyway Blore is twice a match for him in physique and he's very<br/>
&#160;much on his&#160;&#160;guard. And anyway it's a sheer impossibility that Armstrong can<br/>
&#160;be in the house.&#160;&#160;I know he's not there.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But-what other solution is there?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip said softly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's Blore.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh-do you really think-T'<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Listen, my girl. You heard Blore's story. You've got to admit that if it's<br/>
&#160;true,&#160;&#160;I can't possibly have had anything to do with Armstrong's<br/>
&#160;disappearance. His&#160;&#160;story clears me. But it doesn't clear him. We've only<br/>
&#160;his word for it that he&#160;&#160;heard footsteps and saw a man going downstairs and<br/>
&#160;out at the front door. The&#160;&#160;whole thing may be a lie. He may have got rid<br/>
&#160;of Armstrong a couple of hours&#160;&#160;before that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;How?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That we don't know. But if you ask me, we've only one danger to fear-and<br/>
&#160;that&#160;&#160;danger is Blore! What do we know about the man? Less than nothing! All<br/>
&#160;this&#160;&#160;ex-policernan story may be bunkum! He may be anybody-a mad<br/>
&#160;millionaire-a crazy&#160;&#160;business man-an escaped inmate of Broadmoor. One<br/>
&#160;thing's certain. He could have&#160;&#160;done every one of these crimes.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=221></a>&#160;&#160;Vera had gone rather white. She said in a slightly breathless voice: &#34;And<br/>
&#160;&#160;supposing he gets-us?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said softly, patting the revolver in his pocket:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm going to take very good care he doesn't.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Then he looked at her curiously.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Touching faith in me, haven't you, Vera? Quite sure I wouldn't shoot you?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One has got to trust some one. . . . As a matter of fact I think you're<br/>
&#160;wrong&#160;&#160;about Blore. I still think it's Armstrong.&#34; She turned to him<br/>
&#160;suddenly. &#34;Don't&#160;&#160;you feel-all the time-that there's some one. Some one<br/>
&#160;watching and waiting?&#34;&#160;&#160;Lombard said slowly: &#34;That's just nerves.&#34; Vera said<br/>
&#160;eagerly: &#34;Then you have&#160;&#160;felt it?&#34; She shivered. She bent a little closer.<br/>
&#160;&#34;Tell me-you don't think-&#34;&#160;&#160;She broke off, went on: &#34;I read a story once-<br/>
&#160;about two judges that came to a&#160;&#160;small American townfrom the Supreme Court.<br/>
&#160;They administered justice-Absolute&#160;&#160;Justice. Because-they didn't come from<br/>
&#160;this world at all. Lombard raised his&#160;&#160;eyebrows. He said: &#34;Heavenly<br/>
&#160;visitants, ch? No, I don't believe in the&#160;&#160;supernatural. This business is<br/>
&#160;human enough.&#34; Vera said in a low voice:&#160;&#160;&#34;Sometimes-I'm not sure . . . ...<br/>
&#160;Lombard looked at her. He said: &#34;That's&#160;&#160;conscience. . . .&#34; After a moment's<br/>
&#160;silence he said very quietly: &#34;So you did&#160;&#160;drown that kid after all?&#34; Vera<br/>
&#160;said vehemently: &#34;I didn't! I didn't! You've&#160;&#160;no right to say that!&#34; He<br/>
&#160;laughed easily. &#34;Oh, yes, you did, my good girl! I&#160;&#160;don't know why. Can't<br/>
&#160;imagine. There was a man in it probably. Was that it?&#34; A&#160;&#160;sudden feeling of<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=222></a>&#160;lassitude, of intense weariness, spread over Vera's limbs.&#160;&#160;She said in a<br/>
&#160;dull voice: &#34;Yes-there was a man in it. Lombard said softly:&#160;&#160;&#34;Thanks.<br/>
&#160;That's what I wanted to know. Vera sat up suddenly. She exclaimed:&#160;&#160;&#34;What<br/>
&#160;was that? It wasn't an earthquake? Lombard said: &#34;No, no. Queer,&#160;&#160;though-a<br/>
&#160;thud shook the ground. And I thought -did you hear a sort of cry? I&#160;&#160;did.&#34;<br/>
&#160;They stared up at the house. Lombard said: &#34;It came from there. We'd&#160;&#160;better<br/>
&#160;go up and see.&#34; &#34;No, no, I'm not going.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160; &#160;1~<br/>
&#160;&#160;. ..<br/>
&#160;&#160;334<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip grasped her shoulder.<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said, and his voice was urgent and grim:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;This settles it. Armstrong is in hiding somewhere in that house. I'm going<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;get him.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But Vera clung to him. She cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't be a fool. It's us now! We're next! He wants us to look for him!<br/>
&#160;He's&#160;&#160;counting on it!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip stopped. He said thoughtfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There's something in that.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera cried:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;At any rate, you do admit now I was right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He nodded.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes-you win! It's Armstrong all right. But where the devil did he hide&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=223></a>&#160;himself? We went over the place with a fine-tooth comb.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said urgently:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;If you didn't find him last night, you won't find him now. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Please yourself. I am.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said desperately:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;All right. I'll come with you.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They walked up the slope to the house. The terrace was peaceful and&#160;<br/>
&#160;innocuous-looking in the sunshine. They hesitated there a minute, then<br/>
&#160;instead&#160;&#160;of entering by the front door, they made a cautious circuit of the<br/>
&#160;house.&#160;&#160;They found Blore. He was spread-eagled on the stone terrace on the<br/>
&#160;east side, his&#160;&#160;head crushed and mangled by a great block of white marble.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip looked up. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Whose is that window just above?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said in a low shuddering voice:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's mine-and that's the clock from my mantelpiece member now. It was-<br/>
&#160;shaped&#160;&#160;like a bear.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She repeated and her voice shook and quavered:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It was shaped like a bear. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;That's common-sense.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said reluctantly:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=224></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, but-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. . . I re-<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;335<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He must have prepared a secret place beforehand-naturally-of course it's<br/>
&#160;just&#160;&#160;what he would do. You know, like a Priest's Hole in old manor houses.&#34;<br/>
&#160;:,This&#160;&#160;isn't an old house of that kind.&#34; 'He could have had one made.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Philip Lombard&#160;&#160;shook his head. He said: &#34;We measured the place-that first<br/>
&#160;morning. I'll swear&#160;&#160;there's no space unaccounted for.&#34; Vera said: &#34;There<br/>
&#160;must be. Lombard said:&#160;&#160;&#34;I'd like to see-&#34; Vera cried: &#34;Yes, you'd like to<br/>
&#160;see! And he knows that!&#160;&#160;He's in there-waiting for you.&#34; Lombard said, half<br/>
&#160;bringing out the revolver&#160;&#160;from his pocket: :,I've got this, you know.&#34; 'You<br/>
&#160;said Blore was all&#160;&#160;right-that he was more than a match for Armstrong. So<br/>
&#160;he was physically, and&#160;&#160;he was on the lookout too. But what you don't seem<br/>
&#160;to realize is that&#160;&#160;Armstrong is mad! And a madman has all the advantages<br/>
&#160;on his side. He's twice&#160;&#160;as cunning as any one sane can be.&#34; Lombard put<br/>
&#160;back the revolver in his&#160;&#160;pocket. He said: &#34;Come on, then.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said at last: &#34;What are we going to do when night comes?&#34; Vera<br/>
&#160;didn't&#160;answer. He went on accusingly: &#34;You haven't thought of that?&#34; She<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=225></a>&#160;said&#160;helplessly: &#34;What can we do? Oh, my God, I'm frightened. Philip Lombard<br/>
&#160;said&#160;thoughtfully: &#34;It's fine weather. There will be a moon. We must find<br/>
&#160;a place-up&#160;by the top cliffs perhaps. We can sit there and wait for morning.<br/>
&#160;We mustn't go&#160;to sleep. . . . We must watch the whole time. And if any one<br/>
&#160;comes up towards&#160;us, I shall shoot!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You'll be cold, perhaps, in that thin dress?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said with a raucous laugh:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Cold? I should be colder if I were dead!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard said quietly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, that's true.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera moved restlessly.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I shall go mad if I sit here any longer. Let's move about.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;All right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They paced slowly up and down, along the line of the rocks overlooking the<br/>
&#160;&#160;sea. The sun was dropping towards the west. The light was golden and mellow.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It enveloped them in a golden glow.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said,'with a sudden nervous little giggle:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Pity we can't have a bathe. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip was looking down towards the sea. He said abruptly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What's that, there? You see-by that big rock? No-a little further to the<br/>
&#160;&#160;right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera stared. She said:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=226></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;It looks like somebody's clothes!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;A bather, eh?&#34; Lombard laughed. &#34;Queer. I suppose it's only seaweed.&#34;<br/>
&#160;Vera said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Let's go and look.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It is clothes,&#34; said Lombard as they drew nearer. &#34;A bundle of them.<br/>
&#160;That's a&#160;&#160;boot. Come on, let's scramble along here.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;They scrambled over the rocks.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera stopped suddenly. She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's not clothes-it's a man. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;The man was wedged between two rocks, flung there by the tide earlier in<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;day.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard and Vera reached it in a last scramble. They bent down.<br/>
&#160;&#160;A purple discoloured face-a hideous drowned face. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;My God! it's Armstrong.<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;CHAPTER 16<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AEONS PASSED . . . worlds spun and whirled. . . . Time was mo-<br/>
&#160;&#160;tionless. . . . It stood still-it passed through a thousand ages.<br/>
&#160;&#160;No, it was only a minute or so. . . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=227></a>&#160;&#160;Two people were standing looking down on a dead man. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Slowly, very slowly, Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard lifted their heads<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;looked into each other's eyes<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;2<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard laughed. He said: &#34;So that's it, is it, Vera?&#34; Vera said: &#34;There's<br/>
&#160;no&#160;one on the island-no one at all-except us two. . . .&#34; Her voice was a<br/>
&#160;whisper-nothing more. Lombard said: &#34;Precisely. So we know where we are,<br/>
&#160;don't&#160;we?&#34; Vera said: &#34;How was it worked-that trick with the marble bear?&#34;<br/>
&#160;He&#160;shrugged his shoulders. &#34;A conjuring trick, my dear-a very good one. .<br/>
&#160;. Their&#160;eyes met again. Vera thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Why did I never see his face properly before. A wolf-that's what it is-a<br/>
&#160;wolf's face. . . . Those horrible teeth. . - .&#34; Lombard said, and his voice<br/>
&#160;was&#160;a snarl-dangerous-menacing: &#34;This is the end, you understand. We've come<br/>
&#160;to the&#160;truth now. And it's the end. . . .&#34; Vera said quietly: &#34;I understand.<br/>
&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;She stared out to sea. General Macartbur had stared out to seawhen-<br/>
&#160;only&#160;yesterday? Or was it the day before? He too had said, &#34;This is the end.<br/>
&#160;. . .&#34;&#160;He had said it with acceptance-almost with welcome.<br/>
&#160;&#160;338&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;But to Vera the words-the thought-brought rebellion. No, it should not be<br/>
&#160;the&#160;end. She looked down at the dead man. She said: &#34;Poor Dr. Armstrong.<br/>
&#160;Lombard&#160;sneered. He said: &#34;What's this? Womanly pity?&#34; Vera said: &#34;Why not?<br/>
&#160;Haven't you&#160;any pity?&#34; He said: &#34;I've no pity for you. Don't expect it!&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=228></a>&#160;Vera looked down&#160;again at the body. She said: &#34;We must move him. Carry him<br/>
&#160;up to the house.&#34; &#34;To&#160;join the other victims, I suppose? All neat and tidy.<br/>
&#160;As far as I'm concerned&#160;he can stay where he is.&#34; Vera said: &#34;At any rate,<br/>
&#160;let's get him out of reach&#160;of the sea.&#34; Lombard laughed. He said: &#34;If you<br/>
&#160;like.&#34; He bent-tugging at the&#160;body. Vera leaned against him, helping him.<br/>
&#160;She pulled and tugged with all her&#160;might. Lombard panted: &#34;Not such an easy<br/>
&#160;job.&#34; They managed it, however,&#160;drawing the body clear of high water mark.<br/>
&#160;Lombard said as he straightened up:&#160;&#34;Satisfied?&#34; Vera said: &#34;Quite.)) Her<br/>
&#160;tone warned him. He spun round. Even as&#160;he clapped his hand to his pocket<br/>
&#160;he knew that he would find it empty. She had&#160;moved a yard or two away and<br/>
&#160;was facing him, revolver in hand. Lombard said:&#160;&#34;So that's the reason for<br/>
&#160;your womanly solicitude! You wanted to pick my&#160;pocket.&#34; She nodded. She held<br/>
&#160;it steadily and unwaveringly. Death was very near&#160;to Philip Lombard now. It<br/>
&#160;had never, he knew, been nearer. Nevertheless he was&#160;not beaten yet. He said<br/>
&#160;authoritatively:<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Give that revolver to me.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Veralaughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Come on, hand it over.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;His quick brain was working. Which way-which method-talk her over-lull her<br/>
&#160;&#160;into security-or a swift dash-<br/>
&#160;&#160;All his life Lombard had taken the risky way. He took it now.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=229></a>&#160;&#160;He spoke slowly, argumentatively.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now look here, my dear girl, you just listen-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then he sprang. Quick as a panther-as any other feline creature. . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Automatically Vera pressed the trigger<br/>
&#160;&#160;Lombard's leaping body stayed poised in mid-spring, then crashed heavily<br/>
&#160;to&#160;&#160;the ground.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera came warily forward, the revolver ready in her hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But there was no need of caution.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard was dead-shot through the heart.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;3<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Relief possessed Vera-enormous exquisite relief.<br/>
&#160;&#160;At last it was over.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was no more fear-no more steeling of her nerves. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She was alone on the island . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Alone with nine dead bodies . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;But what did that matter? She was alive. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She sat there-exquisitely happy-exquisitely at peace.<br/>
&#160;&#160;No more fear. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;4<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The sun was setting when Vera moved at last. Sheer reaction had kept her<br/>
&#160;&#160;immobile. There had been no room in her for anything but the glorious sense<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;safety.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=230></a>&#160;&#160;She realized now that she was hungry and sleepy. Principally sleepy. She<br/>
&#160;wanted&#160;&#160;to throw herself on her bed and sleep and sleep and sleep. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;To-morrow, perhaps, they would come and rescue her-but she<br/>
&#160;&#160;340<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;didn't really mind. She didn't mind staying here. Not now that she was<br/>
&#160;alone. .&#160;. .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Oh! blessed, blessed peace.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She got to her feet and glanced up at the house.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Nothing to be afraid of any longer! No terrors waiting for her! Just -an<br/>
&#160;ordinary&#160;&#160;well-built modern house. And yet, a little earlier in the day, she<br/>
&#160;had not been&#160;&#160;able to look at it without shivering. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Fear-what a strange thing fear was. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Well, it was over now. She had conquered-had triumphed over the most deadly<br/>
&#160;&#160;peril. By her own quick-wittedness and adroitness she had turned the tables<br/>
&#160;on&#160;&#160;her would-be destroyer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She began to walk up towards the house.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The sun was setting, the sky to the west was streaked with red and orange.<br/>
&#160;It was&#160;&#160;beautiful and peaceful.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The whole thing might be a dream<br/>
&#160;&#160;How tired she was-terribly tired. Her limbs ached, her eyelids were<br/>
&#160;drooping. Not&#160;&#160;to be afraid any more.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=231></a>&#160;&#160;sleep . . . sleep. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;To sleep safely since she was alone on the island. One little Indian boy<br/>
&#160;left all&#160;&#160;alone.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She smiled to herself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She went in at the front door. The house, too, felt strangely peaceful.&#160;<br/>
&#160;Vera thought:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ordinarily one wouldn't care to sleep where there's a dead body in<br/>
&#160;practically&#160;&#160;every bedroom!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Should she go to the kitchen and get herself something to eat?<br/>
&#160;&#160;She hesitated a moment, then decided against it. She was really too tired.<br/>
&#160;. .&#160;&#160;.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She paused by the dining-room door. There were still three little china<br/>
&#160;figures&#160;&#160;in the middle of the table.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera laughed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're behind the times, my dears.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;She picked up two of them and tossed them out through the window. She heard<br/>
&#160;them&#160;&#160;crash on the stone of the terrace.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The third little figure she picked up and held in her hand.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You can come with me. We've won, my dear! We've won!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The hall was dim in the dying light.<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;. To sleep. Sleep . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=232></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera, the little Indian clasped in her hand, began to mount the stairs.<br/>
&#160;Slowly,&#160;&#160;because her legs were suddenly very tired.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One little Indian boy left all alone.&#34; How did it end? Oh, yes! &#34;He got<br/>
&#160;married&#160;&#160;and then there were none.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Married. . . . Funny, how she suddenly got the feeling again that Hugo was<br/>
&#160;in the&#160;&#160;house. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;Very strong. Yes, Hugo was upstairs waiting for her.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Vera said to herself:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Don't be a fool. You're so tired that you're imagining the most fantastic<br/>
&#160;&#160;things. . . .&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Slowly up the stairs.<br/>
&#160;&#160;At the top of them something fell from her hand, making hardly any noise<br/>
&#160;on the&#160;&#160;soft pile carpet. She did not notice that she had dropped the<br/>
&#160;revolver. She was&#160;&#160;only conscious of clasping a little china figure.<br/>
&#160;&#160;How very quiet the house was. And yet-it didn't seem like an empty house.<br/>
&#160;. . .&#160;&#160;Hugo, upstairs, waiting for her. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;One little Indian boy left all alone.&#34; What was the last line again?<br/>
&#160;Something&#160;&#160;about being married-or was it something else?<br/>
&#160;&#160;She had come now to the door of her room. Hugo was waiting for her inside-<br/>
&#160;she was&#160;&#160;quite sure of it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She opened the door . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She gave a gasp . . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;What was that-hanging from the hook in the ceiling? A rope with a noose all<br/>
&#160;&#160;ready? And a chair to stand upon-a chair that could be kicked away. . . .<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=233></a>&#160;&#160;That was what Hugo wanted.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And of course that was the last line of the rhyme.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He went and hanged himself and then there were none.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The little china figure fell from her hand. It rolled unheeded and broke<br/>
&#160;against&#160;&#160;the fender.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Like an automaton Vera moved forward. This was the end-here where the cold<br/>
&#160;wet&#160;&#160;hand (Cyril's hand, of course) had touched her throat. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You can go to the rock, Cyril.<br/>
&#160;&#160;That was what murder was-as easy as that!<br/>
&#160;&#160;But afterwards you went on remembering. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;She climbed up on the chair, her eyes staring in front of her like a&#160;<br/>
&#160;sleepwalker's. . . . She adjusted the noose round her neck.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Hugo was there to see she did what she had to do.<br/>
&#160;&#160;She kicked away the chair. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;SIR THOMAs LEGGE, Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard, said irritably:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But the whole thing's incredible!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine said respectfully:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I know, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The A.C. went on:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Ten people dead on an island and not a living soul on it. It doesn't make<br/>
&#160;&#160;sense!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine said stolidly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nevertheless, it happened, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Sir Thomas Legge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Damn it all, Maine, somebody must have killed'em.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That's just our problem, sir.&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=234></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Nothing helpful in the doctor's report?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;No, sir. Wargrave and Lombard were shot, the first through the head, the<br/>
&#160;second&#160;&#160;through the heart. Miss Brent and Marston died of Cyanide poisoning.<br/>
&#160;Mrs. Rogers&#160;&#160;died of an overdose of Chloral. Rogers' head was split open.<br/>
&#160;Blore's head was&#160;&#160;crushed in. Armstrong died of drowning. Macarthur's skull<br/>
&#160;was fractured by a blow&#160;&#160;on the back of the head and Vera Claythome was<br/>
&#160;hanged.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The A.C. winced. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Nasty business-all of it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He considered for a minute or two. He said irritably:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Do you mean to say that you haven't been able to get anything helpful out<br/>
&#160;of the&#160;&#160;Sticklehaven people. Dash it, they must know something.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine shrugged his shoulders.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;They're ordinary decent seafaring folk. They know that the island was<br/>
&#160;bought by&#160;&#160;a man called Owen-and that's about all they do know.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;EPILOGUE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Who provisioned the island and made all the necessary arrangements?&#34;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#34;Man called Morris. Isaac Morris.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And what does he say about it all?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;He can't say anything, sir, he's dead.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The A.C. frowned.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=235></a>&#160;&#160;&#34;Do we know anything about this Morris?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Oh, yes, sir, we know about him. He wasn't a very savoury gentleman, Mr.<br/>
&#160;Morris.&#160;&#160;He was implicated in that share-pushing fraud of Bennito's three<br/>
&#160;years ago-we're&#160;&#160;sure of that though we can't prove it. And he was mixed up<br/>
&#160;in the dope business.&#160;&#160;And again we can't prove it. He was a very careful<br/>
&#160;man, Morris.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And he was behind this island business?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, sir, he put through the sale-though he made it clear that he was<br/>
&#160;buying&#160;&#160;Indian Island for a third party, unnamed.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Surely there's something to be found out on the financial angle, there?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine smiled.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Not if you knew Morris! He can wangle figures until the best chartered&#160;<br/>
&#160;accountant in the country wouldn't know if he was on his head or his heels!<br/>
&#160;We've&#160;&#160;had a taste of that in the Bermito business. No, he covered his<br/>
&#160;employer's tracks&#160;&#160;all right.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The other man sighed. Inspector Maine went on:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It was Morris who made all the arrangements down at Sticklehaven.<br/>
&#160;Represented&#160;&#160;himself as acting for 'Mr. Owen.' And it was he who explained<br/>
&#160;to the people down&#160;&#160;there that there was some experiment on-some bet about<br/>
&#160;living on a 'desert&#160;&#160;island' for a week-and that no notice was to be taken<br/>
&#160;of any appeal for help from&#160;&#160;out there.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Sir Thomas Legge stirred uneasily. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And you're telling me that those people didn't smell a rat? Not even<br/>
&#160;then?&#34;&#160;&#160;Maine shrugged his shoulders. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're forgetting, sir, that Indian Island previously belonged to young<br/>
&#160;Elmer&#160;&#160;Robson, the American. He had the most extraordinary parties down<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=236></a>&#160;there. I've no&#160;&#160;doubt the local people's eyes fairly popped out over them.<br/>
&#160;But they got used to&#160;&#160;it and they'd begun to feel that anything to do with<br/>
&#160;Indian Island would&#160;&#160;necessarily be incredible. It's natural, that, sir,<br/>
&#160;when you come to think of&#160;&#160;it.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The Assistant Commissioner admitted gloomily that he supposed it<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;was.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Maine said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Fred Narracott-that's the man who took the party out there-did<br/>
&#160;&#160;344<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;say one thing that was illuminating. He said he was surprised to see what<br/>
&#160;sort of&#160;people these were. 'Not at all like Mr. Robson's parfies.' I think<br/>
&#160;it was the fact&#160;that they were all so normal and so quiet that made him<br/>
&#160;override Morris' orders&#160;and take out a boat to the island after he'd heard<br/>
&#160;about the S 0 S signals.&#34;&#160;&#160;&#34;When did he and the other men go?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The signals were seen by a party of boy scouts on the morning of the I I<br/>
&#160;th.&#160;&#160;There was no possibility of getting out there that day. The men got<br/>
&#160;there on the&#160;&#160;afternoon of the 12th at the first moment possible to run a<br/>
&#160;boat ashore there.&#160;&#160;They're all quite positive that nobody could have left<br/>
&#160;the island before they got&#160;&#160;there. There was a big sea on after the storm.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Couldn't some one have swum ashore?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;It's over a mile to the coast and there were heavy seas and big breakers<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=237></a>&#160;&#160;inshore. And there were a lot of people, boy scouts and others on the cliffs<br/>
&#160;&#160;looking out towards the island and watching.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The A.C. sighed. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;What about that gramophone record you found in the house? Couldn't you get<br/>
&#160;hold&#160;&#160;of anything there that might help?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've been into that. It was supplied by a firm that do a lot of theatrical<br/>
&#160;stuff&#160;&#160;and film effects. It was sent to U. N. Owen, Esq., c/o Isaac Morris,<br/>
&#160;and was&#160;&#160;understood to be required for the amateur performance of a hither-<br/>
&#160;to unacted&#160;&#160;play. The typescript of it was returned with the record.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Legge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And what about the subject matter, eh?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine said gravely:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm coming to that, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He cleared his throat.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I've investigated those accusations as thoroughly as I can.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Starting with the Rogerses; who were the first to arrive on the island.<br/>
&#160;They&#160;&#160;were in service with a Miss Brady who died suddenly. Can't get<br/>
&#160;anything definite&#160;&#160;out of the doctor who attended her. He says they<br/>
&#160;certainly didn't poison her, or&#160;&#160;anything like that, but his personal belief<br/>
&#160;is that there was some funny&#160;&#160;business-that she died as the result of<br/>
&#160;neglect on their part. Says it's the sort&#160;&#160;of thing that's quite impossible<br/>
&#160;to prove.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Then there is Mr. Justice Wargrave. That's O.K. He was the judge who<br/>
&#160;sentenced&#160;&#160;Seton.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;By the way, Scion was guilty-unmistakably guilty. Evidence turned uD later<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=238></a>&#160;after&#160;&#160;he was hanged which nroved thnt hPunnrl n-<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;345<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;shadow of doubt. But there was a good deal of comment at the timenine people<br/>
&#160;out&#160;of ten thought Seton was innocent and that the judge's summing up had<br/>
&#160;been&#160;vindictive.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The Claythome girl, I find, was governess in a family where a death<br/>
&#160;occurred by&#160;&#160;drowning. However, she doesn't seem to have had anything to do<br/>
&#160;with it, and as&#160;&#160;a matter of fact she behaved very well, swam out to the<br/>
&#160;rescue and was actually&#160;&#160;carried out to sea and only just rescued in time.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#34;Go on,&#34; said the A.C. with a sigh.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Maine took a deep breath.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Dr. Armstrong now. Well-known man. Had a consulting room in Harley Street.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Absolutely straight and aboveboard in his profession. Haven't been able to<br/>
&#160;trace&#160;&#160;any record of an illegal operation or anything of that kind. It's<br/>
&#160;true that there&#160;&#160;was a woman called Clees who was operated on by him way<br/>
&#160;back in 1925 at&#160;&#160;Leithmore, when he was attached to the hospital there.<br/>
&#160;Peritonitis and she died&#160;&#160;on the operating table. Maybe he wasn't very<br/>
&#160;skilful over the op-after all he&#160;&#160;hadn't much experience-but after all<br/>
&#160;clumsiness isn't a criminal offence. There&#160;&#160;was certainly no motive.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Then there's Miss Emily Brent. Girl, Beatrice Taylor, was in service with<br/>
&#160;her.&#160;&#160;Got pregnant, was turned out by her mistress and went and drowned<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=239></a>&#160;herself. Not&#160;&#160;a nice business-but again not criminal.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That,&#34; said the A.C., &#34;seems to be the point. U. N. Owen dealt with cases<br/>
&#160;that&#160;&#160;the law couldn't touch.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Maine went stolidly on with his list.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Young Marston was a fairly reckless car driver-had his licence endorsed<br/>
&#160;twice&#160;&#160;and he ought to have been prohibited from driving, in my opinion.<br/>
&#160;That's all&#160;&#160;there is to him. The two names John and Lucy Combes were those<br/>
&#160;of two kids he&#160;&#160;knocked down and killed near Cambridge. Some friends of his<br/>
&#160;gave evidence for him&#160;&#160;and he was let off with a fine.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Can't find anything definite about General Macarthur. Fine record-war&#160;<br/>
&#160;service-all the rest of it. Arthur Richmond was serving under him in France<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;was killed in action. No friction of any kind between him and the<br/>
&#160;General. They&#160;&#160;were close friends as a matter of fact. There were some<br/>
&#160;blunders made about that&#160;&#160;time-commanding officers sacrificed men<br/>
&#160;unnecessarily-possibly this was a blunder&#160;&#160;of that kind.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Possibly,&#34; said the A.C.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Now, Philip Lombard. Lombard has been mixed up in some very mirimw chnwe<br/>
&#160;nhrnnd&#160;&#160;14,n'c en;Ipti vprv npnr thp Inw nnrp nr twire.<br/>
&#160;&#160;346&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Got a reputation for daring and for not being over-scrupulous. Sort of<br/>
&#160;fellow who&#160;might do several murders in some quiet out-of-the-way spot.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Then we come to Blore.&#34; Maine hesitated. &#34;He of course was one of our<br/>
&#160;lot.&#34;&#160;&#160;The other man stirred.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Blore,&#34; said the Assistant Commissioner forcibly, &#34;was a bad hat!&#34;&#160;&#160;&#34;You<br/>
&#160;think so, Sir?&#34;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=240></a>&#160;&#160;The A.C. said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I always thought so. But he was clever enough to get away with it. It's<br/>
&#160;my&#160;&#160;opinion that he committed black perjury in the Landor case. I wasn't<br/>
&#160;happy about&#160;&#160;it at the time. But I couldn't find anything. I put Harris onto<br/>
&#160;it and he&#160;&#160;couldn't find anything but I'm still of the opinion that there<br/>
&#160;was something to&#160;&#160;find if we'd known how to set about it. The man wasn't<br/>
&#160;straight.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;There was a pause, then Sir Thomas Legge said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And Isaac Morris is dead, you say? When did he die?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I thought you'd soon come to that, Sir. Isaac Morris died on the night of<br/>
&#160;August&#160;&#160;8th. Took an overdose of sleeping stuff-one of the barbiturates, I<br/>
&#160;understand.&#160;&#160;There wasn't anything to show whether it was accident or<br/>
&#160;suicide.&#34;&#160;&#160;Legge said slowly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Care to know what I think, Maine?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Perhaps I can guess, Sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Legge said heavily:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That death of Morris'is a damned sight too opportune!&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine nodded. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I thought you'd say that, sir.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The Assistant Commissioner brought down his fist with a bang on the table.<br/>
&#160;He&#160;&#160;cried out:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;The whole thing's fantastic-impossible. Ten people killed on a bare rock<br/>
&#160;of an&#160;&#160;island-and we don't know who did it, or why, or how.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Maine coughed. He said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Well, it's not quite like that, sir. We do know why, more or less. Some<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=241></a>&#160;fanatic&#160;&#160;with a bee in his bonnet about justice. He was out to get people<br/>
&#160;who were beyond&#160;&#160;the reach of the law. He picked ten people-whether they<br/>
&#160;were really guilty or not&#160;&#160;doesn't matter-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The Commissioner stirred. He said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Doesn't it? It seems to me-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE VVERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;347<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He stopped. Inspector Maine waited respectfully. With a sigh Legge shook<br/>
&#160;his&#160;&#160;head.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Carry on,&#34; he said. &#34;Just for a minute I felt I'd got somewhere. Got, as<br/>
&#160;it&#160;&#160;were, the clue to the thing. It's gone now. Go ahead with what you were<br/>
&#160;saying.&#34;&#160;&#160;Maine went on:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;There were ten people to be-executed, let's say. They were executed. U.<br/>
&#160;N. Oven&#160;&#160;accomplished his task. And somehow or other he spirited himself off<br/>
&#160;that island&#160;&#160;into thin air.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The A.C. said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;First-class vanishing trick. But you know, Maine, there must be an<br/>
&#160;explanation.&#34;&#160;&#160;Maine said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You're thinking, sir, that if the man wasn't on the island, he couldn't<br/>
&#160;have&#160;&#160;left the island, and according to the account of the interested<br/>
&#160;parties he never&#160;&#160;was on the island. Well, then the only explanation<br/>
&#160;possible is that he was&#160;&#160;actually one of the ten.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The A.C. nodded.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=242></a>&#160;&#160;Maine said earnestly:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;We thought of that, sir. We went into it. Now, to begin with, we're not<br/>
&#160;quite&#160;&#160;in the dark as to what happened on Indian Island. Vera Claythorne<br/>
&#160;kept a diary,&#160;&#160;so did Emily Brent. Old Wargrave made some notes-dry legal<br/>
&#160;cryptic stuff, but&#160;&#160;quite clear. And Blore made notes too. All those<br/>
&#160;accounts tally. The deaths&#160;&#160;occurred in this order: Marston, Mrs. Rogers,<br/>
&#160;Macarthur, Rogers, Miss Brent, War-&#160;grave. After his death Vera Claythorne's<br/>
&#160;diary states that Armstrong left the&#160;&#160;house in the night and that Blore and<br/>
&#160;Lombard had gone after him. Blore has one&#160;&#160;more entry in his notebook. Just<br/>
&#160;two words: 'Armstrong disappeared.'&#160;&#160;&#34;Now, Sir, it seemed to me, taking<br/>
&#160;everything into account, that we might find&#160;&#160;here a perfectly good solution.<br/>
&#160;Armstrong was drowned, you remember. Granting&#160;&#160;that Armstrong was mad, what<br/>
&#160;was to prevent him having killed off all the others&#160;&#160;and then committed<br/>
&#160;suicide by throwing himself over the cliff, or perhaps while&#160;&#160;&#160;trying to swim<br/>
&#160;to the mainland?<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That was a good solution-but it won't do. No, sir, it won't do. First of<br/>
&#160;all&#160;&#160;there's the police surgeon's evidence. He got to the island early on<br/>
&#160;the morning&#160;&#160;of August 13th. He couldn't say much to help us. All he could<br/>
&#160;say was that all&#160;&#160;the people had been dead at least thirty-six hours and<br/>
&#160;probably a good deal&#160;&#160;longer. But he was fairly definite about Armstrong.<br/>
&#160;Said he must have been from&#160;&#160;eight to ten hours in the water before s bodv<br/>
&#160;was washed uD That works out at<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;348<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=243></a>&#160;&#160;this, that Armstrong must have gone into the sea sometime during the night<br/>
&#160;of the&#160;10th-llth-and I'll explain why. We found the point where the body was<br/>
&#160;washed up-it&#160;had been wedged between two rocks and there were bits of cloth,<br/>
&#160;hair, etc., on&#160;them. It must have been deposited there at high water on the<br/>
&#160;11 th-that's to say&#160;round about 11 o'clock A.M. After that, the storm<br/>
&#160;subsided, and succeeding high&#160;water marks are considerably lower.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;You might say, I suppose, that Armstrong managed to polish off the other<br/>
&#160;three&#160;&#160;before he went into the sea that night. But there's another point and<br/>
&#160;one you&#160;&#160;can't get over. Armstrong's body had been dragged above high water<br/>
&#160;mark. We found&#160;&#160;it well above the reach of any tide. And it was laid out<br/>
&#160;straight on the&#160;&#160;ground-all neat and tidy.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;So that settles one point definitely. Some one was alive on the island<br/>
&#160;after&#160;&#160;Armstrong was dead.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He paused and then went on.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And that leaves-just what exactly? Here's the position early on the<br/>
&#160;morning of&#160;&#160;the 11th. Armstrong has 'disappeared' (drowned). That leaves us<br/>
&#160;three people.&#160;&#160;Lombard, Blore and Vera Claythorne. Lombard was shot. His<br/>
&#160;body was down by the&#160;&#160;sea-near Armstrong's. Vera Claythorne was found hanged<br/>
&#160;in her own bedroom.&#160;&#160;Blore's body was on the terrace. His head was crushed<br/>
&#160;in by a heavy marble clock&#160;&#160;that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him<br/>
&#160;from the window above.&#34;&#160;The A.C. said sharply:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Whose window?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Vera Claythorne's. Now, Sir, let's take each of these cases separately.<br/>
&#160;First&#160;&#160;Philip Lombard. Let's say he pushed over that lump of marble onto<br/>
&#160;Blore-then he&#160;&#160;doped Vera Claythorne and strung her up. Lastly, he went down<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=244></a>&#160;to the seashore and&#160;&#160;shot himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But if so, who took away the revolver from him? For that revolver was<br/>
&#160;found up&#160;&#160;in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairs-<br/>
&#160;Wargrave's room.&#34;&#160;The A.C. said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Any fingerprints on it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Yes, sir, Vera Claythorne's.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But, man alive, then-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I know what you're going to say, Sir. That it was Vera Claythorne. That<br/>
&#160;she shot&#160;&#160;Lombard, took the revolver back to the house, toppled the marble<br/>
&#160;block onto Blore&#160;&#160;and then-hanged herself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And that's quite all right-up to a point. There's a chair in her bedroom<br/>
&#160;and on&#160;&#160;the seat of it there are marks of seaweed same as on<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;349<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;her shoes. Looks as though she stood on the chair, adjusted the rope round<br/>
&#160;her&#160;neck and kicked away the chair.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But that chair wasn't found kicked over. It was, like all the other<br/>
&#160;chairs,&#160;&#160;neatly put back against the wall. That was done after Vera<br/>
&#160;Claythorne's death-by&#160;&#160;some one else.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;That leaves us with Blore and if you tell me that after shooting Lombard<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;inducing Vera Claythorne. to hang herself he then went out and pulled<br/>
&#160;down a&#160;&#160;whacking great block of marble on himself by tying a string to it<br/>
&#160;or something&#160;&#160;like that-well, I simply don't believe you. Men don't commit<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=245></a>&#160;suicide that way-and&#160;&#160;what's more Blore wasn't that kind of man. We knew<br/>
&#160;Blore-and he was not the man&#160;&#160;that you'd ever accuse of a desire for<br/>
&#160;abstract justice.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The Assistant Commi sioner said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;141 agee.&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Inspector Maine said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;And therefore, Sir, there must have been some one else on the island. Some<br/>
&#160;one&#160;&#160;who tidied up when the whole business was over. But where was he all<br/>
&#160;the time-and&#160;&#160;where did he go to? The Sticklehaven people are absolutely<br/>
&#160;certain that no one&#160;&#160;could have left the island before the rescue boat got<br/>
&#160;there. But in that case-&#34;&#160;He stopped.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The Assistant Commissioner said:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;In that case-&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He sighed. He shook his head. He leant forward.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;But in that case,&#34; he said, &#34;who killed them?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;A MANUSCRIPT DOCUMENT SENT<br/>
&#160;TO SCOTLAND YARD BY THE MASTER OF<br/>
&#160;THE EMMA JANE, FISHING TRAWLER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;F'Rom MY earliest youth I realized that my nature was a mass of<br/>
&#160;contradictions.&#160;I have, to begin with, an incurably romantic imagination.<br/>
&#160;The practice of throwing&#160;a bottle into the sea with an important document<br/>
&#160;inside was one that never failed&#160;to thrill me when reading adventure stories<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=246></a>&#160;as a child. It thrills me still-and&#160;for that reason I have adopted this<br/>
&#160;course-writing my confession, enclosing it in&#160;a bottle, sealing the latter,<br/>
&#160;and casting it into the waves. There is, I suppose,&#160;a hundred to one chance<br/>
&#160;that my confession may be found-and then (or do I flatter&#160;myself?) a<br/>
&#160;hitherto unsolved murder mystery will be explained.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I was born with other traits besides my romantic fancy. I have a definite<br/>
&#160;&#160;sadistic delight in seeing or causing death. I remember experiments with&#160;<br/>
&#160;wasps-with various garden pests. . . . From an early age I knew very strongly<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;lust to kill.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But side by side with this went a contradictory trait-a strong sense of<br/>
&#160;justice.&#160;&#160;It is abhorrent to me that an innocent person or creature should<br/>
&#160;suffer or die&#160;&#160;by any act of mine. I have always felt strongly that right<br/>
&#160;should prevail.&#160;&#160;It may be understood-I think a psychologist would<br/>
&#160;understandthat with my mental&#160;&#160;makeup being what it was, I adopted the law<br/>
&#160;as a profession. The legal profession&#160;&#160;satisfied nearly all my instincts.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Crime and its punishment has always fascinated me. I enjoy reading every<br/>
&#160;kind of&#160;&#160;detective story and thriller. I have devised for my own private<br/>
&#160;amusement the&#160;&#160;most ingenious ways of carrying out a murder.<br/>
&#160;&#160;When in due course I came to preside over a court of law, that other secret<br/>
&#160;&#160;instinct of mine was encouraged to develop. To see a wretched criminal<br/>
&#160;squirming&#160;&#160;in the dock, suffering the tortures of the damned, as his doom<br/>
&#160;came slowly and&#160;&#160;slowly nearer, was to me an<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;exquisite pleasure. Mind you, I took no pleasure in seeing an innocent man<br/>
&#160;there.&#160;On at least two occasions I stopped cases where to my mind the<br/>
&#160;accused was&#160;palpably innocent, directing the jury that there was no case.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=247></a>&#160;Thanks, however, to&#160;the fairness and efficiency of our police force, the<br/>
&#160;majority of the accused&#160;persons who have come before me to be tried for<br/>
&#160;murder, have been guilty.&#160;&#160;I will say here that such was the case with the<br/>
&#160;man Edward Seton. His appearance&#160;&#160;and manner were misleading and he created<br/>
&#160;a good impression on the jury. But not&#160;&#160;only the evidence, which was clear,<br/>
&#160;though unspectacular, but my own knowledge&#160;&#160;of criminals told me without any<br/>
&#160;doubt that the man had actually committed the&#160;&#160;crime with which he was<br/>
&#160;charged, the brutal murder of an elderly woman who&#160;&#160;trusted him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I have a reputation as a hanging judge, but that is unfair. I have always<br/>
&#160;been&#160;&#160;&#160;strictly just and scrupulous in my summing up of a case.<br/>
&#160;&#160;All I have done is to protect the jury against the emotional effect of<br/>
&#160;emotional&#160;&#160;appeals by some of our more emotional counsel. I have drawn their<br/>
&#160;attention to&#160;&#160;the actual evidence.<br/>
&#160;&#160;For some years past I have been aware of a change within myself, a<br/>
&#160;lessening of&#160;&#160;control-a desire to act instead of to judge.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I have wanted-let me admit it frankly-to commit a murder myself. I<br/>
&#160;recognized&#160;&#160;this as the desire of the artist to express himself! I was, or<br/>
&#160;could be, an&#160;&#160;artist in crime! My imagination, sternly checked by the<br/>
&#160;exigencies of my&#160;&#160;profession, waxed secretly to colossal force.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I must-I must-I must-commit a murder! And what is more, it must be no<br/>
&#160;ordinary&#160;&#160;murder! It must be a fantastical crime-something stupendous-out<br/>
&#160;of the common!&#160;&#160;In that one respect, I have still, I think, an adolescent's<br/>
&#160;imagination.&#160;&#160;I wanted something theatrical, impossible!<br/>
&#160;&#160;I wanted to kill. . . . Yes, I wanted to kill.<br/>
&#160;&#160;But-incongruous as it may seem to some-I was restrained and hampered by my<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=248></a>&#160;innate&#160;&#160;sense of justice. The innocent must not suffer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And then, quite suddenly, the idea came to me-started by a chance remark<br/>
&#160;uttered&#160;&#160;during casual conversation. It was a doctor to whom I was talking-<br/>
&#160;some ordinary&#160;&#160;undistinguished G.P. He mentioned casually how often murder<br/>
&#160;must be committed&#160;&#160;which the law was unable to touch.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And he instanced a particular case-that of an old lady, a patient of his<br/>
&#160;who had&#160;&#160;recently died. He was, he said, himself convinced that her death<br/>
&#160;was due to the&#160;&#160;withholding of a restorative drug by a married couple who<br/>
&#160;attended on her and who&#160;&#160;stood to benefit verv sub-<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;352<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;stantially by her death. That sort of thing, he explained, was quite<br/>
&#160;impossible&#160;to prove, but he was nevertheless quite sure of it in his own<br/>
&#160;mind. He added that&#160;there were many cases of a similar nature going on all<br/>
&#160;the time-cases of&#160;deliberate murder-and all quite untouchable by the law.<br/>
&#160;&#160;That was the beginning of the whole thing. I suddenly saw my way clear. And<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;determined to commit not one murder, but murder on a grand scale.<br/>
&#160;&#160;A childish rhyme of my infancy came back into my mind-the rhyme of the ten<br/>
&#160;little&#160;&#160;Indian boys. It had fascinated me as a child of two-the inexorable<br/>
&#160;&#160;diminishment-the sense of inevitability.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I began, secretly, to collect victims. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;I will not take up space here by going into details of how this was<br/>
&#160;accomplished.&#160;&#160;I had a certain routine line of conversation which I employed<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=249></a>&#160;with nearly every&#160;&#160;one I met-and the results I got were really surprising.<br/>
&#160;During the time I was in&#160;&#160;a nursing home I collected the case of Dr.<br/>
&#160;Armstrong-a violently teetotal sister&#160;&#160;who attended on me being anxious to<br/>
&#160;prove to me the evils of drink by recounting&#160;&#160;to me a case many years ago<br/>
&#160;in hospital when a doctor under the influence of&#160;&#160;alcohol had killed a<br/>
&#160;patient on whom he was operating. A careless question as to&#160;&#160;where the<br/>
&#160;sister in question had trained, etc., soon gave me the necessary data.&#160;&#160;I<br/>
&#160;tracked down the doctor and the patient mentioned without difficulty.&#160;&#160;A<br/>
&#160;conversation between two old military gossips in my Club put me on the track<br/>
&#160;&#160;of General Macarthur. A man who had recently returned from the Amazon gave<br/>
&#160;me a&#160;&#160;devastating r6sum6 of the activities of one Philip Lombard. An<br/>
&#160;indignant mem&#160;&#160;sahib in Majorca recounted the tale of the Puritan Emily<br/>
&#160;Brent and her wretched&#160;&#160;servant girl. Anthony Marston I selected from a<br/>
&#160;large group of people who had&#160;&#160;committed similar offences. His complete<br/>
&#160;callousness and his inability to feel&#160;&#160;any responsibility for the lives he<br/>
&#160;had taken made him, I considered, a type&#160;&#160;dangerous to the community and<br/>
&#160;unfit to live. Ex-Inspector Blore came my way&#160;&#160;quite naturally, some of my<br/>
&#160;professional brethren discussing the Landor case with&#160;&#160;freedom and vigour.<br/>
&#160;I took a serious view of his offence. The police, as servants&#160;&#160;of the law,<br/>
&#160;must be of a high order of integrity. For their word is perforce&#160;&#160;believed<br/>
&#160;by virtue of their profession.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Finally there was the case of Vera Claythorne. It was when I was crossing<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;Atlantic. At a late hour one night the sole occupants of the smoking-<br/>
&#160;room were&#160;&#160;myself and a good-looking young man called Hugo Hamilton.<br/>
&#160;&#160;14tion 14nmiltnn wnq iinhnnnv Tn n-umae thnt nnhannine-.q he hnd<br/>

&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;353<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;taken a considerable quantity of drink. He was in the maudlin confidential<br/>
&#160;stage.&#160;Without much hope of any result I automatically started my routine<br/>
&#160;conversational&#160;gambit. The response was startling. I can remember his words<br/>
&#160;now. He said:&#160;&#160;&#34;You're right. Murder isn't what most people think-giving<br/>
&#160;some one a dollop of&#160;&#160;arsenic-pushing them over a cliff-that sort of stuff.&#34;<br/>
&#160;He leaned forward,&#160;&#160;thrusting his face into mine. He said: &#34;I've known a<br/>
&#160;murderess-known her, I tell&#160;&#160;you. And what's more I was crazy about her. .<br/>
&#160;. . God help me, sometimes I think&#160;&#160;I still<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;am. . . . It's Hell, I tell you-Hell- You see, she did it more or less<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;for me. . . . Not that I ever dreamed. Women are fiends-absolute fiends-you<br/>
&#160;wouldn't think a girl like that-a nice straight jolly girlyou wouldn't think<br/>
&#160;she'd&#160;do that, would you? That she'd take a kid out to sea and let it drown-<br/>
&#160;you wouldn't&#160;think a woman could do a thing like that?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;I said to him:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;Are you sure she did do it?&#34;<br/>
&#160;&#160;He said and in saying it he seemed suddenly to sober up:<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#34;I'm quite sure. Nobody else ever thought of it. But I knew the moment I<br/>
&#160;looked&#160;&#160;at her-when I got back-after . . . And she knew I knew . . . . What<br/>
&#160;she didn't&#160;&#160;realize was that I loved that kid . . . . ))<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=251></a>&#160;&#160;He didn't say any more, but it was easy enough for me to trace back the<br/>
&#160;story and&#160;&#160;reconstruct it.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I needed a tenth victim. I found him in a man named Morris. He was a shady<br/>
&#160;little&#160;&#160;creature. Amongst other things he was a dope pedlar and he was<br/>
&#160;responsible for&#160;&#160;inducing the daughter of friends of mine to take to drugs.<br/>
&#160;She committed suicide&#160;&#160;at the age of twentyone.<br/>
&#160;&#160;During all this time of search my plan had been gradually maturing in my<br/>
&#160;mind.&#160;&#160;It was now complete and the coping stone to it was an interview I had<br/>
&#160;with a&#160;&#160;doctor in Harley Street. I have mentioned that I underwent an<br/>
&#160;operation. My&#160;&#160;interview in Harley Street told me that another operation<br/>
&#160;would be useless. My&#160;&#160;medical adviser wrapped up the information very<br/>
&#160;prettily, but I am accustomed to&#160;&#160;getting at the truth of a statement.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I did not tell the doctor of my decision-that my death should not be a slow<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;protracted one as it would be in the course of nature. No, my death<br/>
&#160;should take&#160;&#160;place in a blaze of excitement. I would live before I died.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And now to the actual mechanics of the crime of Indian Island. To acouire<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;island usine the man Morris to cover v tracks, was easy<br/>
&#160;&#160;354&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;enough. He was an expert in that sort of thing. Tabulating the information<br/>
&#160;I had&#160;collected about my prospective victims, I was able to concoct a<br/>
&#160;suitable bait for&#160;each. None of my plans miscarried. All my guests arrived<br/>
&#160;at Indian Island on the&#160;8th of August. The party included myself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Morris was already accounted for. He suffered from indigestion. Before<br/>
&#160;leaving&#160;&#160;London I gave him a capsule to take last thing at night which had,<br/>
&#160;I said, done&#160;&#160;wonders for my own gastric juices. He accepted it<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=252></a>&#160;unhesitatingly-the man was a&#160;&#160;slight hypochondriac. I had no fear that he<br/>
&#160;would leave any compromising&#160;&#160;documents or memoranda behind. He was not that<br/>
&#160;sort of man.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The order of death upon the island had been subjected by me to special<br/>
&#160;thought&#160;&#160;and care. There were, I considered, amongst my guests, varying<br/>
&#160;degrees of guilt.&#160;&#160;Those whose guilt was the lightest should, I decided,<br/>
&#160;pass out first, and not&#160;&#160;suffer the prolonged mental strain and fear that<br/>
&#160;the more cold-blooded offenders&#160;&#160;were to suffer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Anthony Marston and Mrs. Rogers died first, the one instantaneously, the<br/>
&#160;other&#160;&#160;in a peaceful sleep. Marston, I recognized, was a type born without<br/>
&#160;that feeling&#160;&#160;of moral responsibility which most of us have. He was amoral-<br/>
&#160;pagan. Mrs. Rogers,&#160;&#160;I had no doubt, had acted very largely under the<br/>
&#160;influence of her husband.&#160;&#160;I need not describe closely how those two met<br/>
&#160;their deaths. The police will have&#160;&#160;been able to work that out quite easily.<br/>
&#160;Potassium Cyanide is easily obtained by&#160;&#160;householders for putting down<br/>
&#160;wasps. I had some in my possession and it was easy&#160;&#160;to slip it into<br/>
&#160;Marston's almost empty glass during the tense period after the&#160;&#160;gramophone<br/>
&#160;recital.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I may say that I watched the faces of my guests closely during that<br/>
&#160;indictment&#160;&#160;and I had no doubt whatever, after my long court experience,<br/>
&#160;that one and all&#160;&#160;were guilty.<br/>
&#160;&#160;During recent bouts of pain, I had been ordered a sleeping draught -Chloral<br/>
&#160;&#160;Hydrate. It had been easy for me to suppress this until I had a lethal<br/>
&#160;amount in&#160;&#160;my possession. When Rogers brought up some brandy for his wife,<br/>
&#160;he set it down&#160;&#160;on a table and in passing that table I put the stuff into<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=253></a>&#160;the brandy. It was&#160;&#160;easy, for at that time suspicion had not begun to set<br/>
&#160;in.<br/>
&#160;&#160;General Macarthur met his death quite painlessly. He did not hear me come<br/>
&#160;up&#160;&#160;behind him. I had, of course, to choose my time for leaving the terrace<br/>
&#160;very&#160;&#160;carefully, but everything was successful.<br/>
&#160;&#160;As I had anticipated, a search was made of the island and it was discovered<br/>
&#160;that&#160;&#160;there was no one on it but our seven selves. That at once created an<br/>
&#160;atmosphere&#160;&#160;of suspicion. According to my plan I<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;should shortly need an ally. I selected Dr. Armstrong for that part. He was<br/>
&#160;a&#160;gullible sort of man, he knew me by sight and reputation and it was<br/>
&#160;inconceivable&#160;to him that a man of my standing should actually be a<br/>
&#160;murderer! All his suspicions&#160;were directed against Lombard and I pretended<br/>
&#160;to concur in these. I hinted to him&#160;that I had a scheme by which it might<br/>
&#160;be possible to trap the murderer into in- criminating himself.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Though a search had been made of every one's room, no search had as yet<br/>
&#160;been made&#160;&#160;of the persons themselves. But that was bound to come soon.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I killed Rogers on the morning of August 10th. He was chopping sticks for<br/>
&#160;&#160;lighting the fire and did not hear me approach. I found the key to the&#160;<br/>
&#160;dining-room door in his pocket. He had locked it the night before.&#160;&#160;In the<br/>
&#160;confusion attending the finding of Rogers' body I slipped into Lombard's&#160;<br/>
&#160;room and abstracted his revolver. I knew that he would have one with him-in<br/>
&#160;fact,&#160;&#160;I had instructed Morris to suggest as much when he interviewed him.<br/>
&#160;&#160;At breakfast I slipped my last dose of Chloral into Miss Brent's coffee when<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=254></a>&#160;I&#160;&#160;was refilling her cup. We left her in the dining-room. I slipped in there<br/>
&#160;a&#160;&#160;little while later-she was nearly unconscious and it was easy to inject<br/>
&#160;a strong&#160;&#160;solution of Cyanide into her. The bumblebee business was really<br/>
&#160;rather&#160;&#160;childish-but somehow, you know, it pleased me. I liked adhering as<br/>
&#160;closely as&#160;&#160;possible to my nursery rhyme.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Immediately after this what I had already foreseen happenedindeed I believe<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;suggested it myself. We all submitted to a rigorous search. I had safely<br/>
&#160;hidden&#160;&#160;away the revolver, and had no more Cyanide or Chloral in my<br/>
&#160;possession.&#160;&#160;It was then that I intimated to Armstrong that we must carry<br/>
&#160;our plan into&#160;&#160;effect. It was simply this-I must appear to be the next<br/>
&#160;victim. That would&#160;&#160;perhaps rattle the murderer-at any rate once I was<br/>
&#160;supposed to be dead I could&#160;&#160;move about the house and spy upon the unknown<br/>
&#160;murderer.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Armstrong was keen on the idea. We carried it out that evening. A little<br/>
&#160;plaster&#160;&#160;of red mud on the forehead-the red curtain and the wool and the<br/>
&#160;stage was set.&#160;&#160;The lights of the candles were very flickering and uncertain<br/>
&#160;and the only person&#160;&#160;who would examine me closely was Armstrong.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It worked perfectly. Miss Claythorne screamed the house down when she found<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;seaweed which I had thoughtfully arranged in her room. They all rushed<br/>
&#160;up, and&#160;&#160;I took up my pose of a murdered man.<br/>
&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The effect on them when they found me was all that could be desired.<br/>
&#160;Armstrong&#160;&#160;acted his part in the most professional manner. They carried me<br/>
&#160;upstairs and laid&#160;&#160;me on my bed. Nobody worried about me, they were all too<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=255></a>&#160;deadly scared and&#160;&#160;terrified of each other.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I had a rendezvous with Armstrong outside the house at a quarter to two.<br/>
&#160;I took&#160;&#160;him up a little way behind the house on the edge of the cliff. I<br/>
&#160;said that here&#160;&#160;we could see if any one else approached us, and we should<br/>
&#160;not be seen from the&#160;&#160;house as the bedrooms faced the other way. He was<br/>
&#160;still quite unsuspicious-and&#160;&#160;yet he ought to have been warned- If he had<br/>
&#160;only remembered the words of the&#160;&#160;nursery rhyme, &#34;A red herring swallowed<br/>
&#160;one . He took the red herring all right.&#160;&#160;It was quite easy. I uttered an<br/>
&#160;exclamation, leant over the cliff, told him to&#160;&#160;look, wasn't that the mouth<br/>
&#160;of a cave? He leant right over. A quick vigorous push&#160;&#160;sent him off his<br/>
&#160;balance and splash into the heaving sea below. I returned to the&#160;&#160;house. It<br/>
&#160;must have been my footfall that Blore heard. A few minutes after I had&#160;<br/>
&#160;returned to Armstrong's room I left it, this time making a certain amount of<br/>
&#160;&#160;noise so that some one should hear me. I heard a door open as I got to the<br/>
&#160;bottom&#160;&#160;of the stairs. They must have just glimpsed my figure as I went out<br/>
&#160;of the front&#160;&#160;door.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was a minute or two before they followed me. I had gone straight round<br/>
&#160;the&#160;&#160;house and in at the dining-room window which I had left open. I shut<br/>
&#160;the window&#160;&#160;and later I broke the glass. Then I went upstairs and laid<br/>
&#160;myself out again on&#160;&#160;my bed.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I calculated that they would search the house again, but I did not think<br/>
&#160;they&#160;&#160;would look closely at any of the corpses, a mere twitch aside of the<br/>
&#160;sheet to&#160;&#160;satisfy themselves that it was not Armstrong masquerading as a<br/>
&#160;body. This is&#160;&#160;exactly what occurred.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I forgot to say that I returned the revolver to Lombard's room. It may be<br/>
&#160;of&#160;&#160;interest to some one to know where it was hidden during the search.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=256></a>&#160;There was a&#160;&#160;big pile of tinned food in the larder. I opened the bottommost<br/>
&#160;of the&#160;&#160;tins-biscuits I think it contained, bedded in the revolver and<br/>
&#160;replaced the strip&#160;&#160;of adhesive tape.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I calculated, and rightly, that no one would think of working their way<br/>
&#160;throug4&#160;&#160;a pile of apparently untouched foodstuffs, especially as all the<br/>
&#160;top tins were&#160;&#160;soldered.<br/>
&#160;&#160;The red curtain I had concealed by laying it flat on the seat of one of the<br/>
&#160;&#160;drawing-room chairs under the chintz cover and the wool in the seat cushion,<br/>
&#160;&#160;cutting a small hole.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And now came the moment that I had anticipated-three people who were so&#160;<br/>
&#160;frightened of each other that anything might happen-<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;and one of them had a revolver. I watched them from the windows of the<br/>
&#160;house. When&#160;Blore came up alone I had the big marble clock poised ready.<br/>
&#160;Exit Blore. . . .&#160;&#160;From my window I saw Vera Claythorne shoot Lombard. A<br/>
&#160;daring and resourceful&#160;&#160;young woman. I always thought she was a match for<br/>
&#160;him and more. As soon as that&#160;&#160;had happened I set the stage in her bedroom.<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was an interesting psychological experiment. Would the consciousness of<br/>
&#160;her&#160;&#160;own guilt, the state of nervous tension consequent on having just shot<br/>
&#160;a man, be&#160;&#160;sufficient, together with the hypnotic suggestion of the<br/>
&#160;surroundings, to cause&#160;&#160;her to take her own life? I thought it would. I was<br/>
&#160;right. Vera Claythome hanged&#160;&#160;herself before my eyes where I stood in the<br/>
&#160;shadow of the wardrobe.&#160;&#160;And now for the last stage. I came forward, picked<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=257></a>&#160;up the chair and set it&#160;&#160;against the wall. I looked for the revolver and<br/>
&#160;found it at the top of the stairs&#160;&#160;where the girl had dropped it. I was<br/>
&#160;careful to preserve her fingerprints on it.&#160;&#160;Andnow?<br/>
&#160;&#160;I shall finish writing this. I shall enclose it and seal it in a bottle and<br/>
&#160;I&#160;&#160;shall throw the bottle into the sea.<br/>
&#160;&#160;Why?<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;Yes, why? . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;It was my ambition to invent a murder mystery that no one could solve.&#160;<br/>
&#160;But no artist, I now realize, can be satisfied with art alone. There is a<br/>
&#160;natural&#160;&#160;craving for recognition which cannot be gainsaid.<br/>
&#160;&#160;I have, let me confess it in all humility, a pitiful human wish that some<br/>
&#160;one&#160;&#160;should know just how clever I have been. . . .<br/>
&#160;&#160;In all this, I have assumed that the mystery of Indian Island will remain<br/>
&#160;&#160;unsolved. It may be, of course, that the police will be cleverer than I<br/>
&#160;think.&#160;&#160;There are, after all, three clues. One: the police are perfectly<br/>
&#160;aware that&#160;&#160;Edward Seton was guilty. They know, therefore, that one of the<br/>
&#160;ten people on the&#160;&#160;island was not a murderer in any sense of the word, and<br/>
&#160;it follows,&#160;&#160;paradoxically, that that person must logically be the murderer.<br/>
&#160;The second clue&#160;&#160;lies in the seventh verse of the nursery rhyme. Armstrong's<br/>
&#160;death is associated&#160;&#160;with a &#34;red herring&#34; which he swallowed-or rather which<br/>
&#160;resulted in swallowing&#160;&#160;him! That is to say that at that stage of the affair<br/>
&#160;some hocus-pocus is clearly&#160;&#160;indicated-and that Armstrong was deceived by<br/>
&#160;it and sent to his death. That might&#160;&#160;start a promising line of inquiry. For<br/>
&#160;at that period there are only four persons&#160;&#160;and of those four I am clearly<br/>
&#160;the only one likely to inspire him with&#160;&#160;confidence.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=258></a>&#160;&#160;MASTERPIECES OF MURDER<br/>
&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160;&#160;The third is symbolical. The manner of my death marking me on the forehead.<br/>
&#160;The&#160;&#160;brand of Cain.<br/>
&#160;&#160;There is, I think, little more to say.<br/>
&#160;&#160;After entrusting my bottle and its message to the sea I shall go to my room<br/>
&#160;and&#160;&#160;lay myself down on the bed. To my eyeglasses is attached what seems a<br/>
&#160;length of&#160;&#160;fine black cord-but it is elastic cord. I shall lay the weight<br/>
&#160;of the body on the&#160;&#160;glasses. The cord I shall loop round the door-handle and<br/>
&#160;attach it, not too&#160;&#160;solidly, to the revolver. What I think will happen is<br/>
&#160;this.<br/>
&#160;&#160;My hand, protected with a handkerchief, will press the trigger. My hand<br/>
&#160;will fall&#160;&#160;to my side, the revolver, pulled by the elastic will recoil to<br/>
&#160;the door, jarred&#160;&#160;by the door-handle it will detach itself from the elastic<br/>
&#160;and fall. The elastic,&#160;&#160;released, will hang down innocently from the<br/>
&#160;eyeglasses on which my body is&#160;&#160;lying. A handkerchief lying on the floor<br/>
&#160;will cause no comment whatever.&#160;&#160;I shall be found, laid neatly on my bed,<br/>
&#160;shot through the forehead in accordance&#160;&#160;with the record kept by my fellow<br/>
&#160;victims. Times of death cannot be stated with&#160;&#160;any accuracy by the time our<br/>
&#160;bodies are examined.<br/>
&#160;&#160;When the sea goes down, there will come from the mainland boats and men.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And they will find ten dead bodies and an unsolved problem on Indian Island.<br/>
