ONE&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
MY BEST FRIEND SHOPS&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
FOR A WEDDING DRESS&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My nightmare started like this.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was standing on a deserted street in&#160;some&#160;little&#160;beach town. It was the middle of the night. A&#160;<br/>storm&#160;was blowing. Wind and rain ripped at&#160;the palm&#160;trees along the sidewalk. Pink and&#160;<br/>yellow stucco buildings lined the street, their&#160;win-dows boarded up. A block away, past a line&#160;<br/>of hibiscus bushes, the ocean churned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Florida, I thought. Though I wasn't&#160;sure how I&#160;knew that. I'd never been to Florida.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I heard hooves clattering against the pavement. I turned and saw my&#160;friend Grover&#160;<br/>running for his life.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Yeah, I said hooves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover is a satyr. From&#160;the waist up, he looks like a typical gangly teenager with a peach-fuzz&#160;<br/>goatee and a bad case of acne. He walks with&#160;a strange limp, but unless you happen to catch&#160;<br/>him&#160;without his pants on (which I don't&#160;recommend), you'd never know there was anything&#160;<br/>un-human about him.&#160;Baggy jeans and fake feet hide the fact that he's&#160;got furry hindquarters&#160;<br/>and hooves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover had been my&#160;best&#160;friend in sixth grade.&#160;He'd&#160;gone on this adventure with me&#160;and a girl&#160;<br/>named Annabeth to save the world, but I hadn't seen him&#160;since last July, when he set off alone&#160;<br/>on a dangerous quest—a quest no satyr had ever returned from.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2></a>Anyway, in my dream, Grover was hauling goat tail, holding his human shoes in his hands the&#160;<br/>way he does when he needs to move fast. He&#160;clopped past the little tourist shops and&#160;<br/>surfboard rental places. The wind bent the palm&#160;trees almost to the ground.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover was terrified of something behind him.&#160;He must've just come&#160;from the beach. Wet&#160;<br/>sand was caked in his fur. He'd&#160;escaped from&#160;somewhere. He was trying to get away from&#160;...&#160;<br/>something.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A bone-rattling growl cut through the storm.&#160;Behind Grover, at the far end of the block, a&#160;<br/>shadowy figure loomed. It swatted aside a street&#160;lamp, which burst in a shower of sparks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover stumbled, whimpering in fear. He muttered to himself, Have to get away. Have to&#160;<br/>warn them!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't see what was chasing him,&#160;but I&#160;could hear it muttering and cursing. The ground&#160;<br/>shook as it got closer. Grover dashed around a street&#160;corner and faltered. He'd&#160;run into a dead-<br/>end courtyard full of shops. No time to back&#160;up. The nearest door had&#160;been blown open by the&#160;<br/>storm.&#160;The sign above the darkened display window read: ST. AUGUSTINE BRIDAL&#160;<br/>BOUTIQUE.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover dashed inside. He dove behind a rack of wed-ding dresses.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The monster's shadow passed in front of the shop. I could smell the thing—a sickening&#160;<br/>combination of wet sheep wool and rotten meat&#160;and that weird sour body odor only monsters&#160;<br/>have, like a skunk that's&#160;been living off Mexican food.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover trembled behind the wedding dresses. The monster's shadow passed on.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Silence except for the rain. Grover took&#160;a deep breath. Maybe the thing was gone.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then lightning flashed. The entire front of&#160;the store exploded, and a monstrous voice&#160;<br/>bellowed: &#34;MIIIIINE!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I sat bolt upright, shivering in my&#160;bed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>There was no storm.&#160;No monster.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Morning sunlight filtered&#160;through my bedroom&#160;win-dow.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought I saw a shadow flicker across the glass—a humanlike shape. But then there was a&#160;<br/>knock on my bed-room&#160;door—my mom&#160;called: &#34;Percy, you're going to be late&#34;—and the&#160;<br/>shadow at the window disappeared.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It must've been my&#160;imagination. A fifth-story&#160;window with a rickety old fire escape ... there&#160;<br/>couldn't have been anyone out there.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come on, dear,&#34; my&#160;mother called again. &#34;Last&#160;day of school. You should be excited! You've&#160;<br/>almost&#160;made&#160;it.'&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Coming,&#34; I managed.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3></a>&#160;<br/>I felt under my pillow. My fingers closed reassuringly around the ballpoint pen I always slept&#160;<br/>with. I brought it out, studied the Ancient Greek writing engraved on&#160;the side: Anaklusmos.&#160;<br/>Riptide.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought about uncapping it, but&#160;something held me&#160;back. I hadn't used Riptide for so long….&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Besides, my&#160;mom&#160;had made me&#160;promise not to&#160;use deadly weapons in&#160;the apartment after I'd&#160;<br/>swung a javelin the wrong way and taken out her china cabinet. I put Anaklusmos on my&#160;<br/>nightstand and dragged myself out of bed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I got dressed as quickly as I could. I tried not to&#160;think about my nightmare or monsters or the&#160;<br/>shadow at my window.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Have to get away. Have to warn them!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>What had Grover meant?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I made a three-fingered claw over my&#160;heart&#160;and pushed outward—an ancient gesture Grover&#160;<br/>had once taught me&#160;for warding off evil.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The dream&#160;couldn't have been real.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Last day of school. My mom&#160;was&#160;right, I should have been excited. For the first time in my&#160;<br/>life, I'd almost made it an entire year without&#160;getting expelled. No weird accidents. No fights&#160;<br/>in the classroom.&#160;No teachers turn-ing&#160;into monsters and trying&#160;to kill me&#160;with poisoned&#160;<br/>cafeteria food or exploding homework. Tomorrow,&#160;I'd be on my way to my favorite place in&#160;<br/>the world—Camp&#160;Half-Blood.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Only one more day to go. Surely&#160;even I couldn't mess that up.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As usual, I didn't have a clue how wrong I was.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My mom made blue waffles and blue eggs for breakfast. She's funny that way, celebrating&#160;<br/>special occasions with blue food. I think it's her way of saying anything&#160;is possible. Percy can&#160;<br/>pass seventh grade. Waffles can be blue. Little miracles like that.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I ate at the kitchen table while my&#160;mom&#160;washed dishes. She was dressed in her work&#160;<br/>uniform—a starry blue skirt and a red-and-white striped blouse she wore to sell candy at&#160;<br/>Sweet on America. Her long brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The waffles tasted great, but I guess I wasn't&#160;digging in like I usually did. My mom looked&#160;<br/>over and frowned. &#34;Percy, are you all right?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah ... fine.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But she could always tell when something&#160;was bothering me. She dried her hands and sat&#160;<br/>down across from&#160;me. &#34;School, or ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She didn't need to finish. I knew what she was asking.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;I think Grover's&#160;in trouble,&#34; I said, and I told her about my&#160;dream.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She pursed her lips. We&#160;didn't talk much about the&#160;other part of my&#160;life.&#160;We tried to live as&#160;<br/>normally as possible, but my&#160;mom knew all about Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I wouldn't be too worried, dear,&#34; she said.&#160;&#34;Grover is a big satyr now. If there were a&#160;<br/>problem, I'm sure we would've heard from&#160;... from&#160;camp... .&#34; Her shoulders tensed as she said&#160;<br/>the word camp.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nothing,&#34; she said. &#34;I'll tell you what. This&#160;afternoon we'll celebrate&#160;the end of school. I'll&#160;<br/>take you and Tyson to Rockefeller Center—to that skateboard shop you like.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Oh, man, that was tempting. We&#160;were always&#160;struggling with money. Between my&#160;mom's&#160;<br/>night classes and my&#160;private school tuition, we could never afford to do special stuff like shop&#160;<br/>for a skateboard. But something in her voice bothered me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait a minute,&#34; I said. &#34;I thought we&#160;were packing me&#160;up for camp tonight.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She twisted her dishrag. &#34;Ah, dear, about that ... I got a message from&#160;Chiron last night.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My heart sank. Chiron was the activities director at Camp&#160;Half-Blood. He wouldn't&#160;contact us&#160;<br/>unless some-thing serious was&#160;going on. &#34;What did he say?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He thinks ... it might not be safe for you to come&#160;to camp just yet. We&#160;might have to&#160;<br/>postpone.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Postpone?&#160;Mom,&#160;how could it not be safe?&#160;I'm&#160;a half-blood! It's&#160;like the only safe place on&#160;<br/>earth for me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Usually, dear. But with the problems they're having—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What problems?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy ... I'm very, very sorry. I was hoping to&#160;talk to you about it&#160;this afternoon. I can't&#160;<br/>explain it all now. I'm not even sure Chiron can. Everything happened so suddenly.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My mind was reeling. How could I not go to camp?&#160;I wanted to ask a million questions, but&#160;<br/>just then the kitchen clock chimed the half-hour.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My mom looked almost relieved. &#34;Seven-thirty, dear. You should go. Tyson will be waiting.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, we'll talk this afternoon. Go on to school.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That was the last thing I wanted&#160;to do, but my&#160;mom&#160;had this&#160;fragile look in her eyes—a kind&#160;<br/>of warning, like if I pushed her too hard she'd&#160;start to cry. Besides, she was right about my&#160;<br/>friend Tyson. I had to meet him&#160;at the subway station on time&#160;or he'd&#160;get upset. He was scared&#160;<br/>of traveling underground alone.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>&#160;<br/>I gathered up my&#160;stuff, but I stopped in the doorway. &#34;Mom, this problem&#160;at camp. Does it...&#160;<br/>could it have anything to do&#160;with my dream&#160;about Grover?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She wouldn't meet my&#160;eyes. &#34;We'll talk this afternoon, dear. I'll explain ... as much as I can.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Reluctantly, I told her good-bye. I jogged downstairs to catch the Number Two train.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't know it at the time, but my&#160;mom&#160;and I&#160;would never get to have our afternoon talk.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In fact, I wouldn't be seeing home for a long, long time.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As I stepped outside, I glanced at&#160;the brownstone building across&#160;the street. Just for a second I&#160;<br/>saw a dark shape in the morning sunlight—a&#160;human silhouette against the brick wall, a&#160;<br/>shadow that belonged to no one.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then it rippled and vanished.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>TWO&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I PLAY DODGEBALL&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WITH&#160;CANNIBALS&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My day started normal. Or as normal as it&#160;ever gets at Meriwether College Prep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>See, it's this &#34;progressive&#34; school in downtown Man-hattan, which means we sit on beanbag&#160;<br/>chairs instead of at desks, and we don't get&#160;grades, and the teachers&#160;wear jeans and rock&#160;<br/>concert T-shirts to work.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's&#160;all cool with me. I mean, I'm&#160;ADHD and&#160;dys-lexic, like most half-bloods, so I'd never&#160;<br/>done that great in regular schools even before they kicked me&#160;out. The only bad thing about&#160;<br/>Meriwether was that the teachers always looked on&#160;the bright side of things, and the kids&#160;<br/>weren't always ... well, bright.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Take my&#160;first class today: English. The whole middle school had read&#160;this book called Lord&#160;<br/>of the Flies, where all these&#160;kids get marooned on an island and go psycho. So for our final&#160;<br/>exam, our teachers sent us into the break yard&#160;to spend an hour with no adult supervision to&#160;<br/>see what would happen. What happened was a massive wedgie contest between the seventh&#160;<br/>and eighth graders, two pebble fights, and a full-tackle basketball game. The school bully,&#160;<br/>Matt Sloan, led most of those activities.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>Sloan wasn't&#160;big or strong, but he acted like he&#160;was. He had eyes like a pit bull, and shaggy&#160;<br/>black hair, and he always dressed in expensive but sloppy clothes, like he wanted everybody&#160;<br/>to see how little he cared about his family's&#160;money. One of his front teeth was chipped from&#160;<br/>the time&#160;he'd taken his daddy's Porsche for a&#160;joyride and run into a PLEASE SLOW DOWN&#160;<br/>FOR CHILDREN sign.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Anyway, Sloan was giving everybody wedgies until&#160;he&#160;made&#160;the mistake of trying it on&#160;my&#160;<br/>friend Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson was the only homeless kid at Meriwether&#160;College Prep. As near as my&#160;mom&#160;and I&#160;<br/>could figure, he'd&#160;been aban-doned by his parents when he was very young, probably because&#160;<br/>he was so ... different. He was six-foot-three&#160;and built like the Abominable Snowman, but he&#160;<br/>cried a lot and was scared of just about everything, including his own reflection. His face was&#160;<br/>kind of misshapen and brutal-looking. I couldn't&#160;tell you what color his eyes were, because I&#160;<br/>could never make myself look higher than his crooked teeth. His voice was deep, but he&#160;<br/>talked funny, like a much younger kid—I guess because he'd&#160;never gone to school before&#160;<br/>coming to Meriwether.&#160;He wore tattered jeans,&#160;grimy size-twenty sneakers, and a plaid flannel&#160;<br/>shirt with holes in it. He smelled like a New&#160;York City alleyway, because that's&#160;where he&#160;<br/>lived, in a cardboard refrigerator box off 72nd Street.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Meriwether Prep had adopted him&#160;as a community service project so all the students could&#160;<br/>feel good about themselves. Unfortunately, most of them&#160;couldn't stand Tyson. Once they&#160;<br/>discovered he was a big softie, despite his massive strength and his scary looks, they made&#160;<br/>themselves feel good by picking on him.&#160;I was pretty much his only friend, which meant he&#160;<br/>was my&#160;only friend.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My mom had complained to the school a million times that they weren't doing enough&#160;to help&#160;<br/>him.&#160;She'd called social services, but nothing&#160;ever seemed to happen. The social workers&#160;<br/>claimed Tyson didn't exist. They swore up and down&#160;that they'd&#160;visited the alley we described&#160;<br/>and couldn't find him,&#160;though how you miss a giant kid living in a refrigerator box, I don't&#160;<br/>know.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Anyway, Matt Sloan snuck up behind him&#160;and&#160;tried to give him&#160;a wedgie, and Tyson&#160;<br/>panicked. He&#160;swatted Sloan away a little too hard. Sloan flew fifteen feet and got tangled in&#160;<br/>the little kids'&#160;tire swing.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You freak!&#34; Sloan yelled. &#34;Why don't&#160;you go back to your cardboard box!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson started sobbing. He sat down on the jungle gym&#160;so hard he bent the bar, and buried his&#160;<br/>head in his hands.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Take it back, Sloan!&#34; I shouted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sloan just sneered at me. &#34;Why do you even bother, Jackson?&#160;You might&#160;have friends if you&#160;<br/>weren't always stick-ing up for that freak.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I balled my&#160;fists. I hoped my&#160;face wasn't&#160;as&#160;red as it felt. &#34;He's not a freak. He's&#160;just...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to think of the right thing to say, but Sloan wasn't&#160;listening. He and his big ugly friends&#160;<br/>were too busy laughing. I wondered if it were my&#160;imagination, or if Sloan had more goons&#160;<br/>hanging around him&#160;than usual. I was used to seeing him&#160;with two or three, but today he had&#160;<br/>like, half a dozen more, and I was pretty sure I'd never seen them&#160;before.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just wait till PE, Jackson,&#34; Sloan called. &#34;You are so dead.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When first period ended,&#160;our English&#160;teacher,&#160;Mr.&#160;de Milo, came&#160;outside to inspect the&#160;<br/>carnage. He pronounced that we'd&#160;understood Lord&#160;of the Flies perfectly. We&#160;all passed his&#160;<br/>course, and we should never, never grow&#160;up to be violent people. Matt Sloan nodded&#160;<br/>earnestly, then gave me&#160;a chip-toothed grin.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I had to promise to buy Tyson an extra peanut butter sandwich at lunch to get him&#160;to stop&#160;<br/>sobbing.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I ... I am&#160;a freak?&#34;&#160;he asked me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; I promised, gritting my&#160;teeth.&#160;&#34;Matt Sloan&#160;is the freak.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson sniffled. &#34;You are a good friend. Miss you next year if ... if I can't&#160;...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His voice trembled. I realized he didn't know if&#160;he'd be invited back next year for the&#160;<br/>community service project. I wondered if the headmaster had&#160;even bothered talking to him&#160;<br/>about it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't worry, big guy,&#34; I managed. &#34;Everything's going to be fine.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson gave me&#160;such a grateful look I felt like&#160;a big liar. How could I promise a kid like him&#160;<br/>that anything would be fine?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Our next exam&#160;was science. Mrs. Tesla told&#160;us that we had to mix chemicals until we&#160;<br/>succeeded in making something explode, Tyson was my&#160;lab partner. His hands were way too&#160;<br/>big for the tiny vials we were supposed to use.&#160;He&#160;accidentally knocked a tray of chemicals&#160;<br/>off the counter and made an orange mushroom&#160;cloud in the trash can.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>After Mrs. Tesla evacuated the lab and called the haz-ardous waste removal squad, she&#160;<br/>praised Tyson and me&#160;for being natural chemists. We&#160;were the first ones&#160;who'd ever aced her&#160;<br/>exam&#160;in under thirty seconds.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was glad the morning went fast, because it&#160;kept me&#160;from&#160;thinking too much about my&#160;<br/>problems. I couldn't stand the idea that something might be wrong at camp. Even worse, I&#160;<br/>couldn't shake the memory of my&#160;bad dream.&#160;I had a terrible feeling that Grover was in&#160;<br/>danger.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In social studies, while we were drawing latitude/longi-tude maps, I opened my&#160;notebook and&#160;<br/>stared at the photo inside—my&#160;friend Annabeth on vacation in Washington, D.C. She was&#160;<br/>wearing jeans and a denim&#160;jacket over her orange Camp&#160;Half-Blood T-shirt. Her blond hair&#160;<br/>was pulled back in a bandanna. She was standing&#160;in front of the Lincoln Memorial with her&#160;<br/>arms&#160;crossed, looking extremely pleased with&#160;herself, like she'd personally designed the&#160;<br/>place. See, Annabeth wants to be&#160;an&#160;architect when she grows up, so she's always visiting&#160;<br/>famous monuments and stuff. She's weird that&#160;way. She'd e-mailed me&#160;the picture after spring&#160;<br/>break, and every once in a while I'd look at it&#160;just to remind myself she was real and Camp&#160;<br/>Half-Blood hadn't just been my&#160;imagination.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>I wished Annabeth were here. She'd know what&#160;to make of my dream. I'd never admit it to&#160;<br/>her, but she was smarter than me, even if she was annoying sometimes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was about to close my&#160;notebook when Matt Sloan reached over and ripped the photo out of&#160;<br/>the rings.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey!&#34; I protested.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sloan checked out the picture and his eyes got&#160;wide. &#34;No way, Jackson. Who is that?&#160;She is&#160;<br/>not your—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Give it back!&#34; My ears felt hot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sloan handed the photo to his ugly buddies, who&#160;snick-ered and started ripping it up to make&#160;<br/>spit wads. They were new kids who must've been visiting, because they were all wearing&#160;<br/>those stupid HI! MY NAME IS:&#160;tags from&#160;the admis-sions office. They must've had a weird&#160;<br/>sense of humor, too, because they'd&#160;all filled in strange names like: MARROW SUCKER,&#160;<br/>SKULL EATER, and JOE BOB. No human beings had names like that.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;These guys are moving here next year,&#34; Sloan&#160;bragged, like that was supposed to scare me.&#160;<br/>&#34;I bet they can pay the tuition,&#160;too, unlike your retard friend.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's not retarded.&#34; I had to try really, really hard not to punch Sloan in the face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're such a loser, Jackson. Good thing I'm&#160;gonna put you out of your misery next period.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His huge buddies chewed up my&#160;photo. I wanted&#160;to pulverize them, but I was under strict&#160;<br/>orders from&#160;Chiron never to take my&#160;anger&#160;out on regular mortals, no matter how obnoxious&#160;<br/>they were. I had to save&#160;my fighting for monsters.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Still, part of me&#160;thought, if Sloan only knew who I really was ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The bell rang.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As Tyson and I were leaving class,&#160;a girl's&#160;voice whispered, &#34;Percy!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked around the locker area, but nobody was paying me&#160;any attention. Like any girl at&#160;<br/>Meriwether would ever be&#160;caught dead calling my name.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before I had time to consider whether or not&#160;I'd been imagining things, a crowd of kids&#160;<br/>rushed for the gym, carrying Tyson and me&#160;along with them. It was time for PE. Our coach&#160;<br/>had promised us a free-for-all dodgeball game,&#160;and Matt Sloan had promised to kill me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The gym&#160;uniform&#160;at Meriwether is sky blue shorts and tie-dyed T-shirts. Fortunately, we did&#160;<br/>most of our athletic stuff inside, so we&#160;didn't have to jog through Tribeca looking like a bunch&#160;<br/>of boot-camp hippie children.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I changed as&#160;quickly as I could in the locker room because I didn't want to deal with Sloan. I&#160;<br/>was about to leave when&#160;Tyson called, &#34;Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=9></a>He hadn't changed yet. He&#160;was standing by the weight room&#160;door, clutching his gym&#160;clothes.&#160;<br/>&#34;Will you ... uh ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh. Yeah.&#34; I tried not to sound aggravated about it. &#34;Yeah, sure, man.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson ducked inside the weight room. I stood guard outside the door while he changed. I felt&#160;<br/>kind of awkward doing this, but he asked me&#160;to most days. I think it's&#160;because he's&#160;completely&#160;<br/>hairy and he's&#160;got weird scars on his back that&#160;I've never had the courage to ask him&#160;about.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Anyway, I'd learned the hard way that if people&#160;teased Tyson while he was dressing out, he'd&#160;<br/>get upset and start ripping the doors off lockers.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When we got into the gym, Coach Nunley was sitting at his little desk reading Sports&#160;<br/>Illustrated. Nunley was about a million years old,&#160;with bifocals and no teeth and a greasy&#160;<br/>wave of gray hair. He reminded me&#160;of&#160;the Oracle at Camp&#160;Half-Blood—which was a&#160;<br/>shriveled-up mummy—except Coach&#160;Nunley moved a lot less and he never billowed green&#160;<br/>smoke. Well, at least not that I'd observed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Matt Sloan said, &#34;Coach, can I be captain?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Eh?&#34; Coach Nunley looked up from his magazine. &#34;Yeah,&#34; he mumbled. &#34;Mm-hmm.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sloan grinned and took charge of the picking.&#160;He made me&#160;the&#160;other&#160;team's&#160;captain, but it&#160;<br/>didn't matter who I picked, because all the jocks and the popular kids moved over to Sloan's&#160;<br/>side. So did the big group of visitors.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>On my&#160;side I had Tyson, Corey Bailer the computer geek, Raj Mandali the calculus whiz, and&#160;<br/>a half dozen other kids who always got harassed by Sloan and&#160;his gang. Normally I would've&#160;<br/>been okay with just Tyson—he was worth half&#160;a team&#160;all by himself—but the visitors on&#160;<br/>Sloan's team were almost as tall and strong-looking as Tyson, and there were six of them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Matt Sloan spilled a cage full of balls in the middle of the gym.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Scared,&#34; Tyson mumbled. &#34;Smell funny.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked at him.&#160;&#34;What smells funny?&#34; Because&#160;I didn't figure he was talking about himself.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Them.&#34; Tyson pointed at Sloan's new friends. &#34;Smell funny.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The visitors were cracking their&#160;knuckles, eyeing us like it was&#160;slaughter time. I couldn't help&#160;<br/>wondering where they were from.&#160;Someplace where they fed kids raw meat and beat them&#160;<br/>with sticks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sloan blew the coach's&#160;whistle and the game&#160;began. Sloan's team&#160;ran for the center line. On&#160;<br/>my side, Raj Mandali yelled something in Urdu,&#160;probably &#34;I have to go potty!&#34; and ran for the&#160;<br/>exit. Corey Bailer tried to crawl behind the wall&#160;mat and hide. The rest of my&#160;team&#160;did their&#160;<br/>best to cower in fear and not look like targets.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson,&#34; I said. &#34;Let's&#160;g—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A ball slammed into my&#160;gut. I sat down hard in the mid-dle of the gym&#160;floor. The other team&#160;<br/>exploded in laughter.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a>&#160;<br/>My eyesight&#160;was fuzzy. I felt like I'd just&#160;gotten the Heimlich maneuver from&#160;a gorilla. I&#160;<br/>couldn't believe any-body could throw that hard.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson yelled, &#34;Percy, duck!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I rolled as another dodgeball whistled&#160;past my&#160;ear at the speed of sound.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Whooom!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It hit the wall mat, and Corey Bailer yelped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey!&#34; I yelled at Sloan's team. &#34;You could kill some-body!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The visitor named Joe Bob grinned at me&#160;evilly. Somehow, he looked a lot bigger now ...&#160;<br/>even taller than Tyson. His biceps bulged beneath his T-shirt. &#34;I hope so, Perseus Jackson! I&#160;<br/>hope so!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The way he said my&#160;name sent a chill down&#160;my&#160;back. Nobody called me&#160;Perseus except those&#160;<br/>who knew my true identity. Friends ... and enemies.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>What had Tyson said?&#160;They smell funny.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Monsters.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>All around Matt Sloan, the visitors&#160;were growing in size. They&#160;were no longer kids. They&#160;<br/>were eight-foot-tall giants with&#160;wild eyes, pointy teeth, and hairy arms&#160;tattooed with snakes&#160;<br/>and hula women and Valentine hearts.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Matt Sloan dropped his ball. &#34;Whoa! You're not from&#160;Detroit! Who ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The other kids on his team started screaming&#160;and back-ing toward the exit, but the giant&#160;<br/>named Marrow Sucker threw a ball with deadly&#160;accuracy. It streaked past&#160;Raj Mandali just&#160;as&#160;<br/>he was about to leave and hit the door, slamming it shut&#160;like magic. Raj and some&#160;of the other&#160;<br/>kids banged on it desperately but it wouldn't budge.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let them&#160;go!&#34; I yelled at the giants.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The one called Joe Bob growled at me. He had&#160;a tattoo on his biceps that said: JB luvs&#160;<br/>Babycakes. &#34;And lose our tasty morsels?&#160;No, Son of the Sea God. We&#160;Laistrygonians aren't&#160;<br/>just playing for your death. We&#160;want lunch!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He waved his hand and a new batch of dodgeballs&#160;appeared on the center line—but these balls&#160;<br/>weren't made of red rubber. They were bronze,&#160;the size of cannon balls,&#160;perforated like wiffle&#160;<br/>balls with fire bubbling out the holes. They must've been searing hot, but the giants picked&#160;<br/>them&#160;up with their bare hands.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Coach!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nunley looked up sleepily, but if he saw anything abnormal about the dodgeball game, he&#160;<br/>didn't let on. That's&#160;the problem&#160;with mortals.&#160;A magical force called the Mist obscures the&#160;<br/>true appearance of monsters and gods from&#160;their vision, so mortals tend to see only what they&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=11></a>can understand. Maybe the coach saw a few&#160;eighth graders pounding the younger kids like&#160;<br/>usual. Maybe the other kids saw Matt Sloan's thugs getting ready to toss Molotov cock-tails&#160;<br/>around. (It wouldn't have been the first time.)&#160;At any rate, I was pretty sure nobody else&#160;<br/>realized we were dealing with genuine man-eating bloodthirsty monsters.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah. Mm-hmm,&#34; Coach muttered. &#34;Play nice.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And he went back to his magazine.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The giant named Skull Eater threw his ball. I dove aside as the&#160;fiery bronze comet sailed past&#160;<br/>my shoulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Corey!&#34; I screamed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson pulled him&#160;out from&#160;behind the exercise&#160;mat just as the ball exploded against it,&#160;<br/>blasting the mat to smoking shreds.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Run!&#34; I told my&#160;teammates. &#34;The other exit!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They ran for the locker room, but with another wave of Joe Bob's hand, that door also&#160;<br/>slammed shut.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No one leaves unless you're out!&#34; Joe Bob roared. &#34;And you're not out until we eat you!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He launched his own fireball. My teammates scattered as it blasted a crater in the gym&#160;floor.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I reached for Riptide, which I always kept in&#160;my&#160;pocket, but then I&#160;realized&#160;I was wearing&#160;<br/>gym&#160;shorts. I had no pockets. Riptide was tucked&#160;in my&#160;jeans inside my&#160;gym&#160;locker. And the&#160;<br/>locker room&#160;door was sealed. I&#160;was com-pletely defenseless.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Another fireball came&#160;streaking toward me. Tyson pushed me&#160;out of the way, but the&#160;<br/>explosion still blew me&#160;head over heels. I&#160;found myself sprawled on the gym floor, dazed&#160;<br/>from&#160;smoke, my&#160;tie-dyed T-shirt peppered with&#160;sizzling holes. Just across the center line, two&#160;<br/>hungry giants were glaring down at me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Flesh!&#34; they bellowed. &#34;Hero flesh for lunch!&#34; They both took aim.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy needs help!&#34; Tyson yelled,&#160;and he jumped&#160;in front of me&#160;just as they threw their balls.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I screamed, but it was too late.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Both balls slammed into him&#160;... but no ... he'd&#160;caught them. Somehow Tyson, who was so&#160;<br/>clumsy he knocked over lab equipment and broke playground structures&#160;on a regu-lar basis,&#160;<br/>had caught two fiery metal balls&#160;speeding toward him&#160;at a zillion miles an hour. He sent them&#160;<br/>hurtling back toward their surprised owners, who screamed, &#34;BAAAAAD!&#34; as the bronze&#160;<br/>spheres exploded against their chests.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The giants disintegrated in twin columns of&#160;flame—a sure sign they were monsters, all right.&#160;<br/>Monsters don't die. They just dissipate into&#160;smoke and dust, which saves heroes a lot of&#160;<br/>trouble cleaning up after a fight.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a>&#34;My brothers!&#34; Joe Bob the Cannibal wailed. He&#160;flexed his muscles and his Babycakes tattoo&#160;<br/>rippled. &#34;You will pay for their destruction!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I said. &#34;Look out!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Another comet hurtled toward us. Tyson just had time to swat it aside. It flew straight over&#160;<br/>Coach Nunley's&#160;head and landed in the bleachers with a huge KA-BOOM!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Kids were running around screaming, trying to avoid the sizzling&#160;craters in the floor. Others&#160;<br/>were banging on the door, calling for help. Sloan himself stood petrified in the middle of the&#160;<br/>court, watching in disbelief as&#160;balls of death flew around him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Coach Nunley still wasn't&#160;seeing anything. He tapped his hearing aid like&#160;the explosions were&#160;<br/>giving him&#160;interfer-ence, but he&#160;kept his eyes on his magazine.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Surely the whole school could hear the noise.&#160;The head-master, the police, somebody would&#160;<br/>come&#160;help us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Victory will be ours!&#34; roared Joe Bob&#160;the Cannibal. &#34;We will feast on your bones!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to tell him&#160;he was taking the dodgeball&#160;game&#160;way too seriously, but before I could,&#160;<br/>he hefted another ball. The other&#160;three giants followed his lead.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew we were dead. Tyson couldn't&#160;deflect all those balls at once. His hands had to be&#160;<br/>seriously burned from&#160;blocking the first volley. Without my&#160;sword ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I had a crazy idea.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I ran toward&#160;the locker room.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Move!&#34; I told my&#160;teammates. &#34;Away from&#160;the door.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Explosions behind me. Tyson had batted two of&#160;the balls back toward their owners and&#160;<br/>blasted them&#160;to ashes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That left two giants still standing. &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A third ball hurtled straight at me. I forced myself&#160;to wait—one Mississippi, two&#160;<br/>Mississippi—then dove aside as the fiery&#160;sphere demolished the locker room&#160;door.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now, I figured that the built-up gas in most boys' locker rooms was enough to cause an&#160;<br/>explosion, so I wasn't&#160;surprised when&#160;the flaming dodgeball ignited a huge&#160;<br/>WHOOOOOOOM!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The wall blew apart. Locker doors, socks, athletic sup-porters, and other various nasty&#160;<br/>personal belongings rained all over the gym.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I turned just in time to see Tyson punch Skull&#160;Eater in the face. The giant crumpled. But the&#160;<br/>last giant, Joe Bob, had wisely held on to his own ball, waiting for an opportunity. He threw&#160;<br/>just as Tyson was turning to face him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a>&#160;<br/>The ball caught Tyson square in the chest. He&#160;slid the length of&#160;the&#160;court and slammed into&#160;<br/>the back wall, which cracked and partially crumbled on top of&#160;him,&#160;making a hole right onto&#160;<br/>Church Street. I didn't see how Tyson could still be alive, but he&#160;only looked dazed. The&#160;<br/>bronze ball was smoking at his feet. Tyson tried to pick it up, but&#160;he fell back, stunned, into a&#160;<br/>pile of cinder blocks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well!&#34; Joe Bob gloated. &#34;I'm&#160;the last one standing! I'll have enough meat to bring Babycakes&#160;<br/>a doggie bag!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He picked up another ball and aimed it at Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stop!&#34; I yelled. &#34;It's me&#160;you want!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The giant grinned. &#34;You wish to die first, young hero?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I had to do something. Riptide had to be around here somewhere.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I spotted my&#160;jeans in a smoking heap of clothes right by the giant's feet. If I could only&#160;<br/>get there.... I knew it was hopeless, but I charged.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The giant laughed. &#34;My lunch approaches.&#34; He raised&#160;his arm to throw. I braced myself to die.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Suddenly the giant's body went rigid. His expression changed from&#160;gloating to surprise. Right&#160;<br/>where his belly button should've been, his T-shirt ripped open and he grew&#160;something like a&#160;<br/>horn—no, not a horn—the glowing tip of a blade.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The ball dropped out of his hand. The monster stared down at the knife that had just run him&#160;<br/>through from behind.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He muttered, &#34;Ow,&#34; and burst into a cloud of green flame, which I figured was going to make&#160;<br/>Babycakes pretty upset.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Standing in the smoke was my&#160;friend Annabeth. Her face was grimy and scratched. She had a&#160;<br/>ragged backpack slung over her shoulder, her baseball cap tucked in her pocket, a bronze&#160;<br/>knife in her hand, and a wild look in her storm-gray eyes, like&#160;she'd just been chased a&#160;<br/>thousand miles by ghosts.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Matt Sloan, who'd been standing there dumbfounded the whole time, finally came&#160;to his&#160;<br/>senses. He blinked at Annabeth, as if he&#160;dimly recognized her from&#160;my&#160;notebook picture.&#160;<br/>&#34;That's the girl ... That's&#160;the girl—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth punched him&#160;in the nose and knocked him&#160;flat. &#34;And you,&#34; she told him,&#160;&#34;lay off&#160;<br/>my friend.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The gym&#160;was in flames. Kids were still running around screaming. I heard sirens wailing and&#160;<br/>a garbled voice over the intercom. Through the glass windows of the exit doors, I could see&#160;<br/>the headmaster, Mr. Bonsai, wres-tling with&#160;the lock, a crowd of teachers&#160;piling up behind&#160;<br/>him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth ...&#34; I stammered. &#34;How&#160;did you ... how long have you ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=14></a>&#34;Pretty much&#160;all morning.&#34; She sheathed her bronze knife. &#34;I've been trying to find a good&#160;<br/>time to talk to you, but you were never alone.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The shadow&#160;I saw this morning—that was—&#34; My face felt hot. &#34;Oh my gods, you were&#160;<br/>looking in my&#160;bed-room&#160;window?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;There's&#160;no time&#160;to explain!&#34; she snapped, though&#160;she looked a little red-faced herself. &#34;I just&#160;<br/>didn't want to—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;There!&#34; a woman screamed. The doors burst open and the adults came pouring in.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Meet me&#160;outside,&#34; Annabeth told me. &#34;And him.&#34; She pointed to Tyson,&#160;who was still sitting&#160;<br/>dazed against the wall. Annabeth gave him&#160;a&#160;look of distaste that&#160;I didn't quite understand.&#160;<br/>&#34;You'd better bring him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No time!&#34; she said. &#34;Hurry!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She put on her Yankees baseball cap, which was&#160;a magic gift from&#160;her mom, and instantly&#160;<br/>vanished.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That left me&#160;standing alone in the middle of&#160;the burn-ing gymnasium&#160;when&#160;the headmaster&#160;<br/>came charging in with half the faculty and a couple of police officers.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy Jackson?&#34; Mr. Bonsai said. &#34;What ... how ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Over by the broken wall, Tyson groaned and stood up from&#160;the pile of cinder blocks. &#34;Head&#160;<br/>hurts.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Matt Sloan was coming around, too. He focused on me&#160;with a look of terror. &#34;Percy did it,&#160;<br/>Mr. Bonsai! He set the whole building on fire. Coach Nunley will tell you! He saw it all!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Coach Nunley had been dutifully reading his&#160;magazine, but just my&#160;luck—he chose that&#160;<br/>moment to look up when Sloan said&#160;his name. &#34;Eh?&#160;Yeah. Mm-hmm.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The other adults turned toward me. I knew they&#160;would never believe me, even if I could tell&#160;<br/>them&#160;the truth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I grabbed Riptide out of my ruined jeans,&#160;told Tyson, &#34;Come on!&#34; and jumped through the&#160;<br/>gaping hole in the side of the building.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>THREE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=15></a>WE HAIL THE TAXI&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>OF ETERNAL TORMENT&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth was waiting for us in an alley down&#160;Church Street. She pulled Tyson and me&#160;off the&#160;<br/>sidewalk just as a fire truck screamed past, heading for Meriwether Prep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where'd&#160;you find him?&#34; she&#160;demanded, pointing at Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now, under different circumstances, I would've been really happy to see her. We'd&#160;made our&#160;<br/>peace last summer, despite the fact that her&#160;mom&#160;was Athena and didn't get along with my&#160;<br/>dad. I'd missed Annabeth probably more than I wanted to admit.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But I'd just been attacked by cannibal giants, Tyson had saved my&#160;life three or four times, and&#160;<br/>all Annabeth could do was glare at&#160;him&#160;like he was the problem.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's my&#160;friend,&#34; I told&#160;her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Is he homeless?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What does that have to do with anything?&#160;He can hear you, you know. Why don't&#160;you ask&#160;<br/>him?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She looked surprised. &#34;He can talk?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I talk,&#34; Tyson admitted. &#34;You are pretty.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah! Gross!&#34; Annabeth stepped away from&#160;him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't believe she was being so rude. I examined Tyson's hands, which I was sure must've&#160;<br/>been badly scorched by the flaming dodge balls, but they looked fine—grimy and scarred,&#160;<br/>with dirty fingernails the size&#160;of potato chips—but they always looked like that. &#34;Tyson,&#34; I&#160;<br/>said in disbelief. &#34;Your hands aren't&#160;even burned.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Of course not,&#34; Annabeth muttered. &#34;I'm&#160;surprised the Laistrygonians had the guts to attack&#160;<br/>you with him around.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson seemed fascinated by Annabeth's&#160;blond hair. He tried to touch it, but she smacked his&#160;<br/>hand away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth,&#34; I said, &#34;what are you&#160;talking about?&#160;Laistry-what?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Laistrygonians. The monsters in&#160;the gym.&#160;They're a race of&#160;giant cannibals who live in the&#160;<br/>far north. Odysseus ran into them&#160;once, but I've&#160;never seen them&#160;as far south as New York&#160;<br/>before.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Laistry—I can't&#160;even say that. What would you call them&#160;in English?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She thought about it for a moment. &#34;Canadians,&#34;&#160;she decided. &#34;Now come&#160;on, we have to get&#160;<br/>out of here.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;The police'll be after me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's the least of our problems,&#34; she&#160;said. &#34;Have you been having the dreams?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The dreams ... about Grover?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Her face turned pale. &#34;Grover?&#160;No, what about Grover?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I told her my dream. &#34;Why?&#160;What were you dreaming about?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Her eyes looked stormy, like her mind was racing a mil-lion miles an hour.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Camp,&#34; she&#160;said at last. &#34;Big trouble at camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;My mom was saying the same&#160;thing! But what kind of trouble?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I don't know exactly. Something's wrong. We&#160;have&#160;to get there right away. Monsters have&#160;<br/>been chasing me&#160;all the way from&#160;Virginia, trying to stop me. Have you had a lot of attacks?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I shook my&#160;head. &#34;None all year ... until today.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;None?&#160;But how ...&#34; Her eyes drifted to Tyson. &#34;Oh.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you mean, 'oh'?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson raised&#160;his hand like he was still in class. &#34;Canadians in the gym&#160;called Percy something&#160;<br/>... Son of the Sea God?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and I exchanged looks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't know how I could explain, but I figured Tyson deserved the truth after almost getting&#160;<br/>killed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Big guy,&#34; I said, &#34;you ever hear those old stories about the Greek gods? Like Zeus, Poseidon,&#160;<br/>Athena—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes,&#34; Tyson said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well ... those gods are still alive. They kind of follow Western Civilization around, living in&#160;<br/>the strongest countries, so like now they're in the U.S. And sometimes they have kids with&#160;<br/>mortals. Kids called half-bloods.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes,&#34; Tyson said, like he was still&#160;waiting for me to get to the point.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Uh, well, Annabeth and I are half-bloods,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;We're like ... heroes-in-training. And&#160;<br/>whenever monsters pick up our scent, they attack us. That's&#160;what those giants were in the&#160;<br/>gym.&#160;Monsters.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>I stared at him. He didn't&#160;seem&#160;surprised or&#160;confused by what I was telling him,&#160;which&#160;<br/>surprised and confused me. &#34;So ... you believe me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson nodded. &#34;But you are ... Son of the Sea God?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I admitted. &#34;My dad is Poseidon.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson frowned. Now he looked confused. &#34;But then ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A siren wailed. A police car raced past our alley.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We don't&#160;have time for this,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;We'll talk in the taxi.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;A taxi all the way to camp?&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;You know how&#160;much&#160;money—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Trust me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hesitated. &#34;What about Tyson?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I imagined escorting my&#160;giant friend into Camp&#160;Half-Blood. If he freaked out on a regular&#160;<br/>playground with reg-ular bullies, how would he act at a training camp&#160;for&#160;demigods?&#160;On the&#160;<br/>other hand, the cops would be looking for us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We can't&#160;just leave him,&#34; I decided. &#34;He'll be in trou-ble, too.&#34; *&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Annabeth looked grim. &#34;We definitely need to take him.&#160;Now come&#160;on.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't like the way she said that, as if Tyson&#160;were a big disease we needed to get to the&#160;<br/>hospital, but I followed her down the alley. Together the three of us sneaked through the side&#160;<br/>streets of downtown while a huge column&#160;of&#160;smoke billowed up behind us from&#160;my&#160;school&#160;<br/>gymnasium.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>* * *&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Here.&#34; Annabeth stopped us on the corner of&#160;Thomas and Trimble. She fished around in her&#160;<br/>backpack. &#34;I hope I have one left.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She looked even worse than I'd realized at first. Her chin was cut. Twigs and grass were&#160;<br/>tangled in her ponytail, as if she'd slept several nights in the&#160;open. The slashes on the hems&#160;of&#160;<br/>her jeans looked suspiciously like claw&#160;marks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What are you looking for?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>All around us, sirens wailed. I figured it wouldn't be long before more cops cruised by,&#160;<br/>looking for juvenile delinquent gym-bombers. No doubt Matt Sloan had given them&#160;a&#160;<br/>statement by now. He'd&#160;probably twisted the&#160;story around so that Tyson and I were the&#160;<br/>bloodthirsty cannibals.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Found one. Thank the gods.&#34; Annabeth pulled&#160;out a gold coin that I recognized as a&#160;<br/>drachma, the currency of Mount Olympus. It had Zeus's&#160;likeness stamped on one side and the&#160;<br/>Empire State Building on the other.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a>&#34;Annabeth,&#34; I said, &#34;New York taxi drivers won't take that.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stêthi,&#34; she shouted in Ancient Greek. &#34;Ô hárma diabolês!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As usual, the moment she spoke in the language of Olympus, I&#160;somehow understood it. She'd&#160;<br/>said: Stop, Chariot of Damnation!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That didn't exactly make me&#160;feel real&#160;excited about whatever her plan was.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She threw her coin into the street, but instead&#160;of clattering on the asphalt, the drachma&#160;sank&#160;<br/>right through and disappeared.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>For a moment, nothing happened.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then, just where the coin had fallen, the asphalt dark-ened. It melted into a rectangular pool&#160;<br/>about the size of a parking space—bubbling red&#160;liquid like blood. Then a car erupted from&#160;the&#160;<br/>ooze.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was a taxi, all right, but unlike every other taxi in New York, it wasn't&#160;yellow. It was smoky&#160;<br/>gray. I mean it looked like it was woven out of&#160;smoke, like you could walk right through it.&#160;<br/>There were words printed on the door—some-thing like GYAR SSIRES—but my&#160;dyslexia&#160;<br/>made it hard for me&#160;to decipher what it said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The passenger window rolled down, and an old woman stuck her head out. She had a mop of&#160;<br/>grizzled hair cover-ing her eyes, and she spoke&#160;in a weird mumbling way, like she'd just had a&#160;<br/>shot of Novocain. &#34;Passage?&#160;Passage?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Three to Camp&#160;Half-Blood,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;She opened the cab's&#160;back door and waved at&#160;<br/>me&#160;to get in, like this was all completely normal.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ach!&#34; the old woman screeched. &#34;We don't take his kind!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She pointed a bony finger at Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>What was it?&#160;Pick-on-Big-and-Ugly-Kids Day?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Extra pay,&#34; Annabeth promised. &#34;Three more drachma&#160;on arrival.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Done!&#34; the woman screamed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Reluctantly I got in the cab. Tyson squeezed&#160;in the middle. Annabeth crawled in last.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The interior was also smoky gray, but it felt&#160;solid enough. The seat was cracked and lumpy—<br/>no different than most taxis. There was no Plexiglas screen separating us from&#160;the old lady&#160;<br/>driving ... Wait a minute. There wasn't&#160;just one&#160;old lady. There were three, all crammed in the&#160;<br/>front seat, each with stringy hair covering&#160;her eyes, bony hands, and a charcoal-colored&#160;<br/>sackcloth dress.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The one driving said, &#34;Long Island! Out-of-metro fare bonus! Ha!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=19></a>She floored the accelerator, and my&#160;head slammed against the backrest. A prerecorded voice&#160;<br/>came on over the speaker: Hi, this is Ganymede, cup-bearer to Zeus, and when I'm&#160;out buying&#160;<br/>wine for the Lord of the Skies, I always buckle up!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked down and found a large black chain instead of a seat belt. I decided I wasn't&#160;that&#160;<br/>desperate ... yet.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The cab sped around the corner of West Broadway, and the gray lady sitting in the middle&#160;<br/>screeched, &#34;Look out! Go left!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well, if you'd give me&#160;the eye, Tempest,&#160;I could see that!&#34; the driver complained.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Wait a minute. Give her the eye?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't have time to ask questions because the&#160;driver swerved to avoid an oncoming delivery&#160;<br/>truck, ran over the curb with a jaw-rattling thump, and flew into the next block.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wasp!&#34; the third lady said to the driver. &#34;Give me&#160;the girl's&#160;coin! I want to bite it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You bit it last time, Anger!&#34; said the driver, whose name&#160;must've been Wasp. &#34;It's my turn!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Is not!&#34; yelled the one called Anger.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The middle one, Tempest, screamed, &#34;Red light!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Brake!&#34; yelled Anger.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Instead, Wasp floored the accelerator and rode up&#160;on the curb,&#160;screeching around another&#160;<br/>corner, and knocking over a newspaper box. She left my&#160;stomach somewhere back on&#160;<br/>Broome&#160;Street.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; I said. &#34;But ... can you see?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; screamed Wasp from&#160;behind the wheel.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; screamed Tempest from&#160;the middle.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Of course!&#34; screamed Anger by the shotgun window.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked at Annabeth. &#34;They're blind?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not completely,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;They have an eye.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;One eye?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Each?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No. One eye total.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Next to me, Tyson groaned and grabbed the seat. &#34;Not feeling so good.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, man,&#34; I said, because I'd seen Tyson get carsick on school field trips and it was not&#160;<br/>something you wanted to be within fifty feet of. &#34;Hang in there, big guy. Anybody got a&#160;<br/>garbage bag or something?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The three gray ladies were too busy squabbling to pay me&#160;any attention. I looked over at&#160;<br/>Annabeth, who was hang-ing on for dear life,&#160;and I gave her a why-did-you-do-this-to-me&#160;<br/>look.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey,&#34; she said, &#34;Gray Sisters Taxi is&#160;the fastest way to camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Then why didn't you take it from&#160;Virginia?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's outside their service&#160;area,&#34; she said, like that should be obvious. &#34;They only serve&#160;<br/>Greater New York and surrounding communities.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We've had famous people in this cab!&#34;&#160;Anger exclaimed. &#34;Jason! You remember him?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't remind me!&#34; Wasp wailed. &#34;And we didn't have a cab back then, you old bat. That was&#160;<br/>three thousand years ago!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Give me&#160;the tooth!&#34; Anger tried to grab at&#160;Wasp's&#160;mouth, but Wasp swatted her hand away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Only if Tempest gives me&#160;the eye!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Tempest screeched. &#34;You had it yesterday!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But I'm&#160;driving, you old hag!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Excuses! Turn! That was your turn!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Wasp swerved hard onto Delancey Street, squishing me&#160;between Tyson and the door. She&#160;<br/>punched the gas and we shot up the Williamsburg Bridge at seventy miles&#160;an hour.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The three sisters were fighting for real now, slapping each other as Anger tried to grab&#160;at&#160;<br/>Wasp's&#160;face and Wasp tried to grab at Tempest's. With their hair flying and their mouths&#160;<br/>open, screaming at each other, I realized that&#160;none of the sisters had any teeth except for&#160;<br/>Wasp, who had one mossy yellow incisor. Instead of eyes, they just had closed, sunken&#160;<br/>eyelids, except for Anger, who had one bloodshot green eye that&#160;stared at everything&#160;<br/>hungrily, as if it couldn't get&#160;enough of anything it saw.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Finally Anger, who had the advantage of sight,&#160;managed to yank the tooth out of her sister&#160;<br/>Wasp's&#160;mouth. This made Wasp so mad she&#160;swerved toward the edge of&#160;the Williamsburg&#160;<br/>Bridge, yelling, &#34;'Ivit back! 'Ivit back!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson groaned and clutched his stomach.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Uh, if anybody's interested,&#34; I&#160;said, &#34;we're going to die!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't worry,&#34; Annabeth told me, sounding pretty wor-ried. &#34;The Gray Sisters know what&#160;<br/>they're doing. They're really very wise.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=21></a>This coming from&#160;the daughter of Athena, but I&#160;wasn't&#160;exactly reassured. We&#160;were skimming&#160;<br/>along the edge of a bridge a hundred and&#160;thirty feet above the East River.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, wise!&#34; Anger grinned in the rearview&#160;mirror, showing off her newly acquired tooth.&#160;<br/>&#34;We know things!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Every street in Manhattan!&#34; Wasp bragged, still hitting her sister. &#34;The capital of Nepal!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The location you seek!&#34; Tempest added.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Immediately her sisters pummeled her from&#160;either side, screaming, &#34;Be quiet! Be quiet! He&#160;<br/>didn't even ask yet!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; I said. &#34;What location? I'm&#160;not seeking any—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nothing!&#34; Tempest said. &#34;You're right, boy. It's&#160;nothing!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tell me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; they all screamed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The last time we told, it was horrible!&#34; Tempest said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Eye tossed in a lake!&#34; Anger agreed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Years to find it again!&#34; Wasp moaned.&#160;&#34;And speaking of that—give it back!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; yelled Anger.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Eye!&#34; Wasp yelled. &#34;Gimme!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She whacked her sister Anger on the back. There was a sickening pop and something flew out&#160;<br/>of Anger's face. Anger fumbled for it, trying to&#160;catch it, but she only managed to bat it with&#160;<br/>the back of her hand. The slimy green orb sailed over her shoulder, into the backseat, and&#160;<br/>straight into my lap.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I jumped so hard, my&#160;head hit the ceiling and the eyeball rolled away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I can't&#160;see!&#34; all three sisters yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Give me&#160;the eye!&#34; Wasp wailed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Give her the eye!&#34; Annabeth screamed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I don't have it!&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;There, by your foot,&#34; Annabeth&#160;said. &#34;Don't step on it! Get it!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;not picking that up!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The taxi slammed against the guardrail and skidded along with a horrible grinding noise. The&#160;<br/>whole car shud-dered, billowing gray smoke as if it were about&#160;to dissolve from&#160;the strain.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=22></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Going to be sick!&#34; Tyson warned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth,&#34; I yelled, &#34;let&#160;Tyson use your backpack!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Are you crazy?&#160;Get the eye!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Wasp yanked the wheel, and the taxi swerved away from&#160;the rail. We&#160;hurtled down the bridge&#160;<br/>toward Brooklyn, going faster&#160;than any human taxi. The Gray Sisters screeched and&#160;<br/>pummeled each other and cried out for their eye.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>At last I steeled my&#160;nerves. I ripped off a chunk of my&#160;tie-dyed T-shirt, which was already&#160;<br/>falling apart from&#160;all the burn marks, and used it to pick the eyeball off the floor.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nice boy!&#34; Anger cried, as if&#160;she somehow knew I had her missing peeper. &#34;Give it back!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not until you explain,&#34; I told her. &#34;What were you talking about, the location I seek?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No time!&#34; Tempest cried. &#34;Accelerating!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked out the window. Sure enough, trees&#160;and cars and whole neighborhoods were now&#160;<br/>zipping by in a gray blur. We&#160;were already&#160;out of Brooklyn, heading&#160;through the middle of&#160;<br/>Long Island.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth warned, &#34;they can't find our destina-tion without the eye. We'll just keep&#160;<br/>accelerating until we break into a million pieces.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;First they have to tell me,&#34; I said. &#34;Or I'll open the window and throw the eye into oncoming&#160;<br/>traffic.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; the Gray Sisters wailed. &#34;Too dangerous!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;rolling down the window.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait!&#34; the Gray Sisters screamed. &#34;30, 31, 75, 12!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They belted it out like a quarterback calling a play.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I said. &#34;That makes no sense!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;30, 31, 75, 12!&#34; Anger wailed. &#34;That's all we can&#160;tell you. Now give us the eye! Almost to&#160;<br/>camp!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were off the highway now, zipping through&#160;the countryside of northern Long Island. I&#160;<br/>could see Half-Blood Hill ahead of us, with its&#160;giant pine tree at the crest—Thalia's&#160;tree,&#160;<br/>which contained the life force or a fallen hero.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy!&#34; Annabeth said more urgently. &#34;Give them the eye now!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I decided not to argue. I threw the eye into Wasp's lap.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=23></a>The old lady&#160;snatched it up, pushed it into her eye socket like somebody putting in a contact&#160;<br/>lens, and blinked. &#34;Whoa!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She slammed on the brakes. The taxi spun four or five times in a cloud of smoke and squealed&#160;<br/>to a halt in the middle of the farm&#160;road at the base&#160;of Half-Blood Hill.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson let loose a huge&#160;belch. &#34;Better now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;All right,&#34; I&#160;told the Gray&#160;Sisters. &#34;Now tell me&#160;what those numbers mean.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No time!&#34; Annabeth opened her door. &#34;We have to get out now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was about to ask why, when I looked&#160;up at Half-Blood Hill and understood.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>At the crest of the hill was a group of&#160;campers. And they were under attack.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>FOUR&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>TYSON PLAYS&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WITH&#160;FIRE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Mythologically speaking, if there's anything I hate worse than&#160;trios of old ladies, it's bulls.&#160;<br/>Last summer, I fought the Minotaur on top of Half-Blood Hill. This time&#160;what I saw up there&#160;<br/>was even worse: two bulls. And not just regular bulls—bronze ones the size of elephants. And&#160;<br/>even that wasn't&#160;bad enough. Naturally they had to breathe fire, too.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As soon as we exited the taxi, the Gray Sisters&#160;peeled out, heading back to New York, where&#160;<br/>life was safer. They didn't even wait for their extra three-drachma&#160;payment. They just left us&#160;<br/>on the side&#160;of&#160;the road, Annabeth with nothing but her backpack and knife, Tyson and me&#160;still&#160;<br/>in our burned-up tie-dyed gym&#160;clothes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, man,&#34; said Annabeth, looking at&#160;the battle raging on the hill.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>What worried&#160;me&#160;most weren't the bulls themselves. Or the ten heroes in&#160;full battle armor&#160;<br/>who were getting their bronze-plated booties whooped. What worried me&#160;was that the bulls&#160;<br/>were ranging all over the hill, even around the back side of the pine tree. That shouldn't&#160;have&#160;<br/>been possible. The camp's magic boundaries didn't allow monsters to cross past Thalia's&#160;tree.&#160;<br/>But the metal bulls were doing it anyway.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>One of&#160;the heroes shouted, &#34;Border patrol, to me!&#34; A girl's&#160;voice—gruff&#160;and familiar.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a>Border patrol?&#160;I thought. The camp didn't have a border patrol.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's Clarisse,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;&#34;Come&#160;on, we have to help her.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Normally, rushing to Clarisse's&#160;aid would not have been high on my&#160;&#34;to do&#34; list. She was one&#160;<br/>of the biggest bullies at camp.&#160;The first time&#160;we'd met she tried to introduce my&#160;head to a&#160;<br/>toilet. She was also a daughter of Ares, and&#160;I'd had a very serious disagreement with her&#160;<br/>father last summer, so now the god of war and all his children basically hated my&#160;guts.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Still, she was in trouble. Her&#160;fellow warriors were scat-tering,&#160;running in panic as the bulls&#160;<br/>charged. The grass was burning in huge swathes&#160;around the pine tree. One hero screamed and&#160;<br/>waved his arms&#160;as he ran in circles, the horse-hair plume on his helmet blazing like a fiery&#160;<br/>Mohawk. Clarisse's&#160;own armor was charred. She&#160;was fighting with a broken spear shaft, the&#160;<br/>other end embedded uselessly in the&#160;metal joint of one bull's shoulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I uncapped my ballpoint pen. It shimmered,&#160;growing longer and heavier until I held the&#160;<br/>bronze sword Anaklusmos in my&#160;hands. &#34;Tyson,&#160;stay here. I don't want you taking any more&#160;<br/>chances.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;We need him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at her. &#34;He's mortal. He got&#160;lucky with the dodge balls but he can't—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, do you know what those are up there? The Colchis bulls, made by Hephaestus&#160;<br/>himself. We&#160;can't&#160;fight them&#160;without Medea's Sunscreen SPF&#160;50,000. We'll get burned to a&#160;<br/>crisp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Medea's what?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth rummaged through her backpack and cursed. &#34;I had a jar of tropical coconut scent&#160;<br/>sitting on my night-stand at home. Why didn't I bring it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'd learned a long time ago not to question Annabeth too much. It just made me&#160;more&#160;<br/>confused. &#34;Look, I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm&#160;not going to let Tyson get&#160;<br/>fried.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson, stay back.&#34; I raised my&#160;sword. &#34;I'm&#160;going in.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson tried to protest, but I was already running up the hill toward Clarisse, who was yelling&#160;<br/>at her patrol, trying to get them&#160;into phalanx&#160;formation. It was a good idea. The few who were&#160;<br/>listening lined up shoulder-to-shoulder, lock-ing their shields to&#160;form&#160;an ox-hide—and-bronze&#160;<br/>wall, their spears bristling over the top like porcupine quills.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Unfortunately, Clarisse could only muster six campers. The other four were still running&#160;<br/>around with their helmets on fire. Annabeth ran&#160;toward them, trying to help. She taunted one&#160;<br/>of the bulls into chasing her, then turned invis-ible, completely confusing the monster. The&#160;<br/>other bull charged Clarisse's&#160;line. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was halfway up the hill—not close enough to help. Clarisse hadn't even seen me&#160;yet.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=25></a>The bull moved deadly fast for something so big. Its metal hide gleamed in the sun. It had&#160;<br/>fist-sized rubies for eyes, and horns of polished silver. When it opened its hinged mouth, a&#160;<br/>column&#160;of white-hot flame blasted out.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hold the line!&#34; Clarisse ordered her warriors.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Whatever else you could say about Clarisse, she was brave. She was a big girl with cruel eyes&#160;<br/>like her father's. She looked like she was born to&#160;wear Greek battle armor, but I didn't see how&#160;<br/>even she could stand against that bull's charge.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Unfortunately, at that moment, the other bull lost interest in finding&#160;Annabeth. It turned,&#160;<br/>wheeling around behind Clarisse on her unprotected side.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Behind you!&#34; I yelled. &#34;Look out!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I shouldn't have said anything, because all I did was star-tle her. Bull Number One crashed&#160;<br/>into her shield, and the phalanx broke. Clarisse went flying backward and landed in a&#160;<br/>smoldering patch of grass. The bull charged past her,&#160;but not before blasting the other heroes&#160;<br/>with its fiery breath. Their shields melted right&#160;off their arms. They dropped their weapons&#160;<br/>and ran as Bull Number Two closed in on Clarisse for the kill.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I lunged forward and grabbed Clarisse by the straps&#160;of her armor. I dragged her out of&#160;the way&#160;<br/>just as Bull Number Two freight-trained past. I gave it a good&#160;swipe with&#160;Riptide and&#160;cut a&#160;<br/>huge gash in its flank, but the monster just creaked and groaned and kept on going.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It hadn't touched me, but I could feel the heat&#160;of its metal skin. Its&#160;body temperature could've&#160;<br/>microwaved a frozen burrito.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let me&#160;go!&#34; Clarisse pummeled&#160;my hand. &#34;Percy, curse you!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I dropped her in a heap next to the pine tree&#160;and turned to face the bulls. We were on the&#160;<br/>inside slope of the hill now, the valley of Camp&#160;Half-Blood directly below us—the cabins, the&#160;<br/>training facilities, the Big&#160;House—all of it at risk if&#160;these bulls got past us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth shouted orders to the&#160;other heroes, telling them&#160;to spread out and keep the bulls&#160;<br/>distracted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Bull Number One ran a wide arc, making its way back toward me. As it passed the middle of&#160;<br/>the hill, where the invisible boundary line should've kept it out, it slowed down a little, as if it&#160;<br/>were struggling against a strong wind; but then it broke through and kept coming. Bull&#160;<br/>Number Two turned to face me, fire sputtering from&#160;the gash I'd cut in its side. I couldn't&#160;tell&#160;<br/>if it felt any pain, but its ruby eyes seemed to glare at me&#160;like I'd just made things personal.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't fight both bulls at the same time. I'd&#160;have to take down Bull Number Two first, cut&#160;<br/>its head off before Bull Number&#160;One charged back into range.&#160;My arms&#160;already felt tired. I&#160;<br/>realized how long it had been since I'd worked&#160;out with Riptide, how&#160;out of practice I was.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I lunged but Bull Number Two blew flames at me. I&#160;rolled aside as the air&#160;turned to pure heat.&#160;<br/>All the oxygen was sucked out of my&#160;lungs.&#160;My foot caught on some-thing—a tree root,&#160;<br/>maybe—and pain shot up my&#160;ankle. Still, I managed to slash with my&#160;sword and lop off part&#160;<br/>of the monster's snout. It galloped away, wild&#160;and disoriented. But before I could feel too&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=26></a>good about that, I tried to stand, and my left leg buckled underneath me. My ankle was&#160;<br/>sprained, maybe broken.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Bull Number One charged straight toward me. No way could I crawl out of its path.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth shouted: &#34;Tyson, help him!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Somewhere near, toward the crest of the hill, Tyson wailed, &#34;Can't—get—through!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I, Annabeth Chase, give you permission to enter camp!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Thunder shook the hillside. Suddenly Tyson was there, barreling toward me, yelling: &#34;Percy&#160;<br/>needs help!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before I could tell him&#160;no, he dove between me&#160;and the bull just as it unleashed a nuclear&#160;<br/>firestorm.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The blast swirled around him&#160;like a red tornado.&#160;I could only see the black silhouette of&#160;his&#160;<br/>body. I knew with hor-rible certainty that my&#160;friend had just been turned into a column of&#160;<br/>ashes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But when the fire died, Tyson was still standing there, completely unharmed. Not even his&#160;<br/>grungy clothes were scorched. The bull must've been&#160;as surprised as I was, because before it&#160;<br/>could unleash a second blast, Tyson balled his&#160;fists and slammed them&#160;into the bull's face.&#160;<br/>&#34;BAD COW!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His fists made a crater where the bronze bull's&#160;snout used to be. Two&#160;small columns of flame&#160;<br/>shot out of its ears. Tyson hit it again,&#160;and the bronze crumpled under his hands like&#160;<br/>aluminum&#160;foil. The bull's face now looked like a sock puppet pulled inside&#160;out.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Down!&#34; Tyson yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The bull staggered and fell on its back. Its legs moved feebly in the air, steam&#160;coming out of&#160;<br/>its ruined head in odd places.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth ran over to check on me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My ankle felt like it was filled with acid, but&#160;she gave me&#160;some&#160;Olympian nectar&#160;to drink&#160;<br/>from&#160;her canteen, and I immediately started to feel better. There was a burning smell that I&#160;<br/>later learned was me. The hair on my&#160;arms&#160;had been completely singed off.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The other bull?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth pointed down the hill. Clarisse had taken care of Bad Cow Number Two. She'd&#160;<br/>impaled it through the back leg with a celestial bronze spear. Now, with its snout half gone&#160;<br/>and a huge gash in its side, it was trying to run in slow motion, going in circles like some&#160;kind&#160;<br/>of merry-go-round animal.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=27></a>Clarisse pulled off her helmet and marched toward us. A strand of her stringy brown hair was&#160;<br/>smoldering, but she didn't seem&#160;to notice. &#34;You—ruin—everything!&#34; she yelled at me. &#34;I had&#160;<br/>it under control!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was too stunned to answer. Annabeth&#160;grumbled, &#34;Good to see you too, Clarisse.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Argh!&#34; Clarisse screamed. &#34;Don't ever, EVER try sav-ing me again!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Clarisse,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;you've got wounded campers.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That sobered her up. Even Clarisse cared about the soldiers under her command.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll be back,&#34; she growled, then trudged off to assess the damage.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at Tyson. &#34;You didn't die.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson looked down like he was embarrassed. &#34;I&#160;am&#160;sorry. Came&#160;to help. Disobeyed you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;My fault,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;I had no choice. I had to&#160;let Tyson cross the boundary line to save&#160;<br/>you. Otherwise, you would've died.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let him&#160;cross the boundary&#160;line?'&#34; I asked. &#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; she said, &#34;have you ever looked at Tyson closely?&#160;I mean ... in the face. Ignore the&#160;<br/>Mist, and really look at him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Mist makes humans see only what their brains can process ... I knew it could fool&#160;<br/>demigods too, but...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked Tyson in the face. It wasn't&#160;easy. I'd&#160;always had trouble looking directly at him,&#160;<br/>though I'd never quite understood why. I'd thought&#160;it was just because he always had peanut&#160;<br/>butter in his crooked teeth. I forced&#160;myself to focus at his big&#160;lumpy nose, then a little higher&#160;<br/>at his eyes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No, not eyes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>One eye. One large, calf-brown eye, right in the middle of his forehead, with thick lashes and&#160;<br/>big tears trickling down his cheeks on either side.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson,&#34; I stammered. &#34;You're a ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Cyclops,&#34; Annabeth offered. &#34;A baby, by the looks&#160;of him.&#160;Probably why he couldn't get past&#160;<br/>the boundary line as easily as the bulls.&#160;Tyson's one of the homeless orphans.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;One of the what?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They're in almost all the big cities,&#34; Annabeth&#160;said distastefully. &#34;They're ... mistakes, Percy.&#160;<br/>Children of nature spirits and&#160;gods ... Well, one god in particular, usually ... and they don't&#160;<br/>always come out right. No one wants them. They&#160;get tossed aside. They grow up wild on the&#160;<br/>streets. I don't know how this one found you, but&#160;he obviously likes you. We&#160;should take him&#160;<br/>to Chiron, let him&#160;decide what to do.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=28></a>&#34;But the fire. How—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's a Cyclops.&#34; Annabeth paused, as if she were remembering something unpleasant. &#34;They&#160;<br/>work the forges of the gods. They have to be immune to fire. That's&#160;what I was trying to tell&#160;<br/>you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was completely shocked. How had I&#160;never realized what Tyson was?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But I didn't have much time to think about it just then. The whole side&#160;of the hill was burning.&#160;<br/>Wounded heroes needed attention. And there were still two banged-up bronze bulls to dispose&#160;<br/>of, which I didn't figure would fit in our normal recycling bins.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse came&#160;back over and wiped the soot&#160;off her forehead. &#34;Jackson, if you can stand, get&#160;<br/>up. We&#160;need to carry the wounded back to the Big House, let Tantalus know what's&#160;<br/>happened.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tantalus?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The activities director,&#34; Clarisse&#160;said&#160;impatiently.&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Chiron is the activities director. And where's Argus?&#160;He's&#160;head of security. He should be&#160;<br/>here.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse made a sour face. &#34;Argus got fired. You two have been gone too long. Things are&#160;<br/>changing.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But Chiron ... He's&#160;trained kids to fight monsters for over three thousand years. He can't just&#160;<br/>be gone. What hap-pened?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That happened,&#34; Clarisse snapped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She pointed to Thalia's&#160;tree.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Every camper knew the story behind the tree. Six years ago, Grover, Annabeth, and two other&#160;<br/>demigods named Thalia and Luke had come&#160;to&#160;Camp&#160;Half-Blood chased by an army&#160;of&#160;<br/>monsters. When they got cornered on&#160;top of this hill, Thalia, a daughter of Zeus, had made&#160;<br/>her last stand here to give her friends time to&#160;reach safety. As she was dying, her father, Zeus,&#160;<br/>took pity on her and changed her into a pine tree. Her spirit had reinforced the magic borders&#160;<br/>of the camp, protecting it from&#160;monsters. The&#160;pine had been here ever since, strong and&#160;<br/>healthy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But now, its needles were yellow. A huge pile of dead ones littered the base of the tree. In the&#160;<br/>center of the trunk, three feet&#160;from&#160;the ground, was a puncture mark the size of a bullet hole,&#160;<br/>oozing green sap.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A sliver of ice ran through&#160;my&#160;chest. Now I understood why the camp was in danger. The&#160;<br/>magical borders were fail-ing because Thalia's&#160;tree was dying.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Someone had poisoned it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=29></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>FIVE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I GET A NEW&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>CABIN MATE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Ever come&#160;home and found your room messed up?&#160;Like some helpful person (hi, Mom)&#160;has&#160;<br/>tried to &#34;clean&#34; it, and suddenly you can't&#160;find anything?&#160;And even if nothing is missing, you&#160;<br/>get that creepy feeling like somebody's been&#160;looking through your private stuff and dusting&#160;<br/>everything with lemon furniture polish?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's&#160;kind of the way I felt seeing Camp&#160;Half-Blood again.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>On the surface, things&#160;didn't look all that different. The Big House was still there with its blue&#160;<br/>gabled roof and its wraparound porch. The strawberry fields still baked in the sun. The same&#160;<br/>white-columned Greek buildings were scattered around the valley—the amphitheater, the&#160;<br/>combat arena, the dining pavilion overlooking Long Island Sound. And nestled between the&#160;<br/>woods and the creek were the same&#160;cabins—a crazy assortment of twelve buildings, each&#160;<br/>repre-senting a different Olympian god.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But there was an air of danger now. You could tell something was wrong. Instead of playing&#160;<br/>volleyball in the sandpit,&#160;counselors and satyrs were stockpiling weapons in the tool shed.&#160;<br/>Dryads armed with bows and arrows talked nervously at the edge of the woods. The forest&#160;<br/>looked sickly, the grass in the meadow was pale yellow, and the fire marks on Half-Blood&#160;<br/>Hill stood&#160;out like ugly scars.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Somebody had messed with my&#160;favorite place in the world, and I was not ... well, a happy&#160;<br/>camper.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As we made&#160;our way to the Big House, I recognized a lot of kids from&#160;last summer. Nobody&#160;<br/>stopped to talk. Nobody said, &#34;Welcome&#160;back.&#34;&#160;Some&#160;did double takes when they saw Tyson,&#160;<br/>but most just walked grimly past and carried&#160;on with their duties—running messages,&#160;toting&#160;<br/>swords to sharpen on the grinding wheels. The camp felt like a military school. And believe&#160;<br/>me, I know. I've been kicked out of a couple.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>None of that mattered to Tyson. He was absolutely fas-cinated by everything he saw.&#160;<br/>&#34;Whasthat!&#34; he gasped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The stables for pegasi,&#34;&#160;I said. &#34;The winged horses.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Whasthat!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um&#160;... those are the toilets.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=30></a>&#34;Whasthat!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The cabins for the campers. If&#160;they don't know who your Olympian parent is, they put you in&#160;<br/>the Hermes cabin—that brown one over there—until you're deter-mined. Then, once they&#160;<br/>know, they put you in your&#160;dad or mom's group.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He looked at me&#160;in awe. &#34;You ... have a cabin?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Number three.&#34; I pointed to a low&#160;gray building made of sea stone.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You live with friends in&#160;the cabin?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No. No, just me.&#34; I didn't feel like explaining. The embarrassing truth: I was the only one&#160;<br/>who stayed in that cabin because I wasn't&#160;supposed to be alive. The &#34;Big Three&#34; gods—Zeus,&#160;<br/>Poseidon, and Hades—had made a pact after World War II not to have any more children&#160;<br/>with mortals. We&#160;were more powerful than regular half-bloods. We&#160;were too unpredictable.&#160;<br/>When we got mad we tended to cause problems&#160;... like World War II, for instance. The &#34;Big&#160;<br/>Three&#34; pact had only been broken twice—once&#160;when Zeus sired Thalia, once when Poseidon&#160;<br/>sired me. Neither of us should've been born.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Thalia had gotten herself turned into a pine&#160;tree when she was twelve. Me ... well, I was doing&#160;<br/>my best not to fol-low her example. I had nightmares about what Poseidon&#160;might turn&#160;me&#160;into&#160;<br/>if I were ever on the verge of death— plankton, maybe. Or a floating patch of kelp.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When we got to the Big House, we found Chiron&#160;in his apartment, listening to his favorite&#160;<br/>1960s lounge music while he packed his saddlebags. I guess I should mention—Chiron is a&#160;<br/>centaur. From the waist up he looks like a reg-ular middle-aged guy with curly brown hair&#160;<br/>and a scraggly beard. From&#160;the waist down, he's&#160;a white stallion. He can pass for human&#160;by&#160;<br/>compacting his lower half into a magic wheelchair. In fact, he'd&#160;passed himself off as my&#160;<br/>Latin teacher&#160;during my&#160;sixth-grade year. But&#160;most of the time, if the ceilings are high&#160;<br/>enough, he prefers hanging out&#160;in full centaur form.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As soon as we saw him,&#160;Tyson froze.&#160;&#34;Pony!&#34; he cried in&#160;total rapture.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron turned, looking offended. &#34;I beg your pardon?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth ran up and hugged him.&#160;&#34;Chiron, what's&#160;happening?&#160;You're not ... leaving?&#34; Her&#160;<br/>voice was shaky. Chiron was like a second father to her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron ruffled her hair and gave her a kindly smile. &#34;Hello, child. And Percy, my&#160;goodness.&#160;<br/>You've grown over the year!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I swallowed. &#34;Clarisse said you were ... you were ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fired.&#34; Chiron's eyes glinted with dark humor. &#34;Ah, well, someone had to take the blame.&#160;<br/>Lord Zeus was most upset. The tree he'd&#160;created&#160;from&#160;the spirit of his daughter, poisoned! Mr.&#160;<br/>D had to punish someone.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Besides himself, you mean,&#34; I growled. Just&#160;the thought of the camp director, Mr. D, made&#160;<br/>me&#160;angry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a>&#34;But this is crazy!&#34; Annabeth cried. &#34;Chiron, you couldn't have had anything to do with&#160;<br/>poisoning Thalia's&#160;tree!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nevertheless,&#34; Chiron sighed, &#34;some in&#160;Olympus do not trust me&#160;now, under the&#160;<br/>circumstances.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What circumstances?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron's face&#160;darkened. He stuffed a Latin-English dictionary into his saddlebag while the&#160;<br/>Frank Sinatra music oozed from&#160;his boom&#160;box.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson was still staring at Chiron in amazement.&#160;He whimpered like he wanted to pat Chiron's&#160;<br/>flank but was afraid to&#160;come&#160;closer. &#34;Pony?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron sniffed. &#34;My dear young Cyclops! I am&#160;a centaur.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Chiron,&#34; I said. &#34;What about&#160;the tree?&#160;What hap-pened?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He shook his head sadly. &#34;The poison used&#160;on Thalia's&#160;pine is something from&#160;the&#160;<br/>Underworld, Percy. Some venom&#160;even&#160;I have never seen. It must have come&#160;from&#160;a monster&#160;<br/>quite deep in the pits of Tartarus.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Then we know who's responsible. Kro—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Do not invoke the titan lord's&#160;name,&#160;Percy. Especially not here, not now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But last summer he tried to cause a civil war in Olympus! This&#160;has to be his idea. He'd&#160;get&#160;<br/>Luke to do it, that traitor.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Perhaps,&#34;&#160;Chiron said.&#160;&#34;But I fear I am&#160;being&#160;held responsible because I did not prevent it&#160;<br/>and I cannot cure it. The tree has only&#160;a few weeks of life left unless ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Unless what?&#34;&#160;Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; Chiron said. &#34;A foolish thought. The whole valley is feeling the shock of the poison.&#160;<br/>The magical borders are deteriorating. The camp itself is dying. Only one source of magic&#160;<br/>would be strong enough to reverse the poison, and it was lost centuries ago.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked. &#34;We'll go find it!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron closed his saddlebag. He pressed the&#160;stop but-ton on his boom&#160;box. Then he turned&#160;<br/>and rested his hand on my shoulder, looking me&#160;straight in the eyes. &#34;Percy, you must&#160;<br/>promise me&#160;that you will not act&#160;rashly. I told your mother I did not want you to come here at&#160;<br/>all this summer. It's&#160;much too dangerous. But&#160;now that you are here, stay here. Train hard.&#160;<br/>Learn to fight. But do not leave.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Why?&#34; I asked. &#34;I want to do something! I can't&#160;just let the borders fail. The whole camp&#160;will&#160;<br/>be—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Overrun by monsters,&#34; Chiron said. &#34;Yes, I fear so. But you must not&#160;let yourself be baited&#160;<br/>into hasty action! This could be&#160;a trap of the titan lord. Remember last summer! He almost&#160;<br/>took your life.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a>&#160;<br/>It was true, but still, I wanted&#160;to help so badly. I also wanted to make Kronos pay. I mean,&#160;<br/>you'd think the titan lord would've learned his lesson eons ago when he was over-thrown&#160;by&#160;<br/>the gods. You'd think getting chopped into a mil-lion pieces and cast into&#160;the darkest part of&#160;<br/>the Underworld would give him&#160;a subtle&#160;clue that nobody wanted him&#160;around. But no.&#160;<br/>Because he was immortal, he was still alive down&#160;there in Tartarus—suffering in eternal pain,&#160;<br/>hunger-ing to return and take revenge on Olympus. He couldn't&#160;act on his own, but he was&#160;<br/>great at twisting the minds of mor-tals and even gods to do his dirty work.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The poisoning had to be his doing. Who else would&#160;be so low as to attack Thalia's&#160;tree, the&#160;<br/>only thing left of a hero who'd given her life to save her friends?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth was trying hard not to cry. Chiron brushed a tear from&#160;her cheek. &#34;Stay with Percy,&#160;<br/>child,&#34; he told her. &#34;Keep him&#160;safe. The prophecy—remember it!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—I will.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um&#160;...&#34; I said. &#34;Would this be the super-dangerous prophecy that has me&#160;in it, but the gods&#160;<br/>have forbidden you to tell me&#160;about?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nobody answered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Right,&#34; I muttered. &#34;Just checking.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Chiron ...&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;You told me&#160;the&#160;gods made you immortal only so long as you&#160;<br/>were needed to train heroes. If&#160;they dismiss you from&#160;camp—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Swear you will do your best to keep&#160;Percy from&#160;danger,&#34; he insisted. &#34;Swear upon the River&#160;<br/>Styx.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—I swear it upon the River Styx,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Thunder rumbled outside.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Very well,&#34;&#160;Chiron said. He seemed to relax just&#160;a little. &#34;Perhaps my&#160;name&#160;will be cleared&#160;<br/>and I shall return. Until then, I&#160;go to visit my&#160;wild kinsmen in&#160;the Everglades. It's&#160;possible&#160;<br/>they know of some&#160;cure for the poisoned tree that&#160;I have forgotten. In any event, I will stay in&#160;<br/>exile until this matter is resolved ... one way or another.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth stifled a sob. Chiron patted her shoulder awk-wardly. &#34;There, now, child. I must&#160;<br/>entrust your safety to Mr. D and the new activities director. We must hope ... well, perhaps&#160;<br/>they won't destroy the camp quite as quickly as I fear.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Who is this Tantalus guy, anyway?&#34; I demanded. &#34;Where does he get off taking your job?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A conch horn blew across the valley. I hadn't realized how late&#160;it was. It&#160;was time for the&#160;<br/>campers to assemble for dinner.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go,&#34; Chiron&#160;said. &#34;You&#160;will meet him at the&#160;pavilion. I will contact&#160;your mother, Percy, and&#160;<br/>let her know you're safe. No doubt she'll be worried by now. Just remember my&#160;warning! You&#160;<br/>are in grave danger. Do not think for a moment that the titan lord&#160;has forgotten you!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=33></a>With that, he clopped out of the apartment and&#160;down the hall, Tyson calling after him,&#160;&#34;Pony!&#160;<br/>Don't go!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I realized I'd forgotten to tell Chiron about my&#160;dream&#160;of Grover. Now it was too late. The best&#160;<br/>teacher I'd ever had was gone, maybe&#160;for good.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson started bawling almost as bad as Annabeth. I tried to tell them&#160;that things would&#160;be&#160;<br/>okay, but I didn't believe it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The sun was setting behind the dining pavilion&#160;as&#160;the campers came up from their cabins. We&#160;<br/>stood in the shadow of a marble column and watched them&#160;file in. Annabeth was still pretty&#160;<br/>shaken up, but she promised she'd talk to us later. Then she went off to join her siblings from&#160;<br/>the Athena cabin—a dozen boys and girls with blond hair and gray eyes like hers. Annabeth&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;the oldest, but she'd been at camp&#160;more summers than just about anybody. You could&#160;<br/>tell that by looking at her camp necklace—one bead for every summer, and Annabeth had six.&#160;<br/>No one ques-tioned her right to lead the line.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Next came Clarisse, leading the Ares cabin. She had one arm&#160;in a sling and a nasty-looking&#160;<br/>gash on her cheek, but otherwise her encounter&#160;with the bronze bulls didn't&#160;seem&#160;to have&#160;<br/>fazed her. Someone had taped a piece of paper to her back that said, YOU MOO, GIRL! But&#160;<br/>nobody in her cabin was bothering to tell her about it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>After the Ares kids came the Hephaestus cabin—six guys led by Charles Beckendorf, a big&#160;<br/>fifteen-year-old African American kid. He had hands&#160;the size of&#160;catchers'&#160;mitts and a face that&#160;<br/>was hard and squinty from looking into a blacksmiths forge all day. He was nice enough once&#160;<br/>you got to know him,&#160;but no one ever called him&#160;Charlie or Chuck or Charles. Most just&#160;<br/>called him&#160;Beckendorf. Rumor was he could make anything. Give him&#160;a chunk of metal and&#160;<br/>he could create a razor-sharp sword or a robotic warrior&#160;or a singing birdbath for your&#160;<br/>grandmother's garden. Whatever you wanted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The other cabins filed in: Demeter, Apollo,&#160;Aphrodite, Dionysus. Naiads came&#160;up from the&#160;<br/>canoe lake. Dryads melted out of the trees.&#160;From&#160;the meadow came a dozen satyrs, who&#160;<br/>reminded me painfully of Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'd always had a soft spot for the satyrs. When&#160;they were at camp, they had to do all kinds of&#160;<br/>odd jobs for Mr. D, the director, but their most&#160;important work was out in the real world.&#160;<br/>They were the camp's seekers. They went&#160;undercover into schools all over the world, looking&#160;<br/>for potential half-bloods and escorting them&#160;back to camp. That's&#160;how I'd met Grover. He had&#160;<br/>been the first one to recognize I was a demigod.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>After the satyrs filed in to dinner, the Hermes&#160;cabin brought up the rear. They were always the&#160;<br/>biggest cabin. Last summer, it had been led by&#160;Luke, the guy who'd fought with Thalia and&#160;<br/>Annabeth on top of Half-Blood Hill. For a while, before Poseidon had claimed me, I'd lodged&#160;<br/>in the Hermes cabin. Luke had befriended&#160;me&#160;... and then he'd&#160;tried to kill me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now the Hermes cabin was led by Travis and Connor Stoll. They weren't twins, but they&#160;<br/>looked so much alike it didn't matter. I could never remember which one was older. They&#160;<br/>were both tall and skinny, with mops of brown hair that hung in their eyes. They wore orange&#160;<br/>CAMP HALF-BLOOD T-shirts untucked over baggy shorts, and they had those elfish&#160;<br/>features all Hermes's&#160;kids had: upturned eyebrows, sarcastic smiles, a gleam&#160;in their eyes&#160;<br/>

<a name=34></a>whenever they looked at you—like they were about to drop a firecracker down your shirt. I'd&#160;<br/>always thought it was funny that&#160;the god of thieves would have&#160;kids with the last name&#160;<br/>&#34;Stoll,&#34; but the only time&#160;I mentioned it to Travis and Connor, they both stared at me&#160;blankly&#160;<br/>like they didn't&#160;get the joke.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As soon as the last campers had filed in,&#160;I led Tyson into the middle of the pavilion.&#160;<br/>Conversations faltered. Heads&#160;turned. &#34;Who invited that?&#34;&#160;somebody at the Apollo table&#160;<br/>murmured.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I glared in their direction, but&#160;I couldn't figure out who'd spoken.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>From&#160;the head table a familiar voice drawled,&#160;&#34;Well, well, if it isn't Peter Johnson. My&#160;<br/>millennium&#160;is complete.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I gritted my&#160;teeth. &#34;Percy Jackson ... sir.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Mr. D sipped his Diet Coke. &#34;Yes. Well, as&#160;you young people say these days: Whatever.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He was wearing his usual leopard-pattern Hawaiian shirt, walking shorts, and tennis shoes&#160;<br/>with black socks. With his pudgy belly and his&#160;blotchy red face, he looked like a Las Vegas&#160;<br/>tourist who'd stayed up too late in the casi-nos. Behind him,&#160;a nervous-looking satyr was&#160;<br/>peeling the skins off grapes and handing them&#160;to Mr. D one at a time.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Mr. D's real name&#160;is Dionysus. The god of wine.&#160;Zeus appointed him&#160;director of Camp Half-<br/>Blood to dry out for a hundred years—a punishment for chasing some&#160;off-limits wood&#160;<br/>nymph.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Next to him,&#160;where Chiron usually sat (or stood,&#160;in centaur form), was someone I'd never seen&#160;<br/>before—a pale, horribly thin man in a threadbare orange prisoner's jump-suit. The number&#160;<br/>over his pocket read 0001. He had blue shadows&#160;under his eyes, dirty fingernails, and badly&#160;<br/>cut gray hair, like his last haircut had been done with a weed&#160;whacker. He stared at me; his&#160;<br/>eyes made me&#160;nervous. He looked ... fractured. Angry and frustrated&#160;and hungry all at the&#160;<br/>same&#160;time.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This boy,&#34; Dionysus told him,&#160;&#34;you need&#160;to watch. Poseidon's child, you know.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah!&#34; the prisoner said. &#34;That one.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His tone made it obvious that he and Dionysus had already discussed me&#160;at length.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I am&#160;Tantalus,&#34; the prisoner said, smiling coldly. &#34;On special assignment here until,&#160;well,&#160;<br/>until my&#160;Lord Dionysus decides otherwise. And you, Perseus&#160;Jackson, I do&#160;expect you&#160;to&#160;<br/>refrain from&#160;causing any more trouble.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Trouble?&#34; I demanded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Dionysus snapped his fingers. A newspaper appeared on the table—the front page of today's&#160;<br/>New York Post, There was my&#160;yearbook picture from&#160;Meriwether Prep. It was hard for me&#160;to&#160;<br/>make out the headline, but I had a pretty good guess what it said. Something like: Thirteen-<br/>Year-Old Lunatic Torches Gymnasium.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=35></a>&#34;Yes, trouble,&#34; Tantalus said&#160;with satisfaction. &#34;You caused plenty of it last summer, I&#160;<br/>understand.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was too mad to speak. Like it was my fault&#160;the gods had almost gotten into a civil war?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A satyr inched forward nervously and set a plate of bar-becue in front of Tantalus. The new&#160;<br/>activities director licked his lips. He looked at his empty&#160;goblet and said, &#34;Root beer. Barq's&#160;<br/>special stock. 1967.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The glass filled itself with foamy soda. Tantalus stretched out his hand&#160;hesitantly, as if he&#160;<br/>were afraid the goblet was hot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go on, then, old fellow,&#34; Dionysus said, a strange sparkle in his eyes.&#160;&#34;Perhaps now it will&#160;<br/>work.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus grabbed for the glass,&#160;but it scooted away before he&#160;could touch it. A few drops of&#160;<br/>root beer spilled, and Tantalus tried to dab them&#160;up with his fingers, but&#160;the drops rolled away&#160;<br/>like quicksilver before he could touch them.&#160;He growled and turned&#160;toward the plate of&#160;<br/>barbecue. He&#160;picked up a fork and tried to stab&#160;a piece of brisket, but&#160;the plate skittered down&#160;<br/>the table and flew off the end, straight into the coals of the brazier.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Blast!&#34; Tantalus muttered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah, well,&#34; Dionysus said, his voice dripping with false sympathy.&#160;&#34;Perhaps a few more days.&#160;<br/>Believe me, old chap, working at this camp&#160;will be torture enough. I'm&#160;sure your old curse&#160;<br/>will fade eventually.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Eventually,&#34; muttered Tantalus, staring at Dionysus's&#160;Diet Coke. &#34;Do you have any idea how&#160;<br/>dry one's&#160;throat gets after three thousand years?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're that spirit from&#160;the Fields of Punishment,&#34; I said. &#34;The one who stands in the lake&#160;<br/>with the fruit tree hanging over&#160;you, but you can't&#160;eat or drink.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus sneered at me. &#34;A&#160;real scholar, aren't&#160;you, boy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You must've done something really horrible when&#160;you were alive,&#34; I said, mildly impressed.&#160;<br/>&#34;What was it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus's&#160;eyes narrowed. Behind him, the satyrs were shaking their heads vigorously, trying&#160;<br/>to warn me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll be watching you, Percy Jackson,&#34; Tantalus&#160;said. &#34;I don't want any problems at my camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Your camp has problems already ... sir.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, go sit down, Johnson,&#34; Dionysus sighed. &#34;I believe that table over&#160;there is yours—the&#160;<br/>one where no one else ever wants to sit.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My face was burning, but I knew better than to&#160;talk back. Dionysus was an overgrown&#160;brat,&#160;<br/>but he was an immortal, superpowerful&#160;overgrown&#160;brat. I said, &#34;Come on, Tyson.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, no,&#34; Tantalus said. &#34;The monster stays here. We&#160;must decide&#160;what to do with it.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=36></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Him,&#34; I snapped. &#34;His name&#160;is Tyson.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The new activities director raised an eyebrow.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson saved the camp,&#34; I insisted. &#34;He pounded those bronze bulls. Otherwise they would've&#160;<br/>burned down this whole place.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes,&#34; Tantalus sighed, &#34;and what&#160;a pity that would've been.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Dionysus snickered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Leave us,&#34; Tantalus ordered, &#34;while&#160;we decide this crea-ture's fate.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson looked at me&#160;with fear in his one big eye, but I knew I couldn't disobey a direct order&#160;<br/>from&#160;the camp direc-tors. Not openly, anyway.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll be right over here, big guy,&#34; I promised. &#34;Don't&#160;worry. We'll find you a good place to&#160;<br/>sleep tonight.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson nodded. &#34;I believe you. You are my&#160;friend.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Which made me&#160;feel a whole lot guiltier.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I trudged over to the Poseidon table and slumped onto the bench. A&#160;wood nymph brought me&#160;<br/>a plate of Olympian olive-and-pepperoni pizza, but I wasn't&#160;hungry. I'd been almost killed&#160;<br/>twice today. I'd managed to end my&#160;school year&#160;with a complete disaster. Camp&#160;Half-Blood&#160;<br/>was in serious trouble and Chiron had told me&#160;not to do anything about it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't feel very thankful, but&#160;I took my dinner, as was customary, up to the bronze brazier&#160;<br/>and scraped part of it into the flames.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Poseidon,&#34; I murmured, &#34;accept my&#160;offering.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And send me some&#160;help while you're at it, I prayed silently. Please.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The smoke from&#160;the burning pizza changed into some-thing fragrant—the smell of a clean sea&#160;<br/>breeze with wild-flowers&#160;mixed in—but I had no&#160;idea if that meant my&#160;father was really&#160;<br/>listening.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I went back to my&#160;seat. I didn't think things could get much worse. But then Tantalus had one&#160;<br/>of the satyrs blow the conch horn to&#160;get our attention for announcements.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, well,&#34; Tantalus said, once the talking had died down. &#34;Another fine meal! Or so I am&#160;<br/>told.&#34; As he spoke, he inched his hand toward&#160;his refilled dinner plate, as if maybe the food&#160;<br/>wouldn't notice what he was doing, but it did. It&#160;shot away down the table as soon as he got&#160;<br/>within six&#160;inches.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=37></a>&#34;And here on my&#160;first day of authority,&#34; he continued, &#34;I'd&#160;like to say what a pleasant form&#160;of&#160;<br/>punishment it is to be here. Over&#160;the course of the summer, I hope&#160;to torture, er,&#160;interact with&#160;<br/>each and every one of you children. You all look&#160;good enough to eat.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Dionysus clapped politely, leading to some&#160;halfhearted applause from&#160;the satyrs. Tyson was&#160;<br/>still standing at the head table, looking uncomfortable, but every&#160;time&#160;he&#160;tried to scoot out of&#160;<br/>the limelight, Tantalus pulled him&#160;back.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And now some&#160;changes!&#34; Tantalus gave the campers a crooked smile. &#34;We are reinstituting&#160;<br/>the chariot races!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Murmuring broke out at all the tables—excitement, fear, disbelief.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Now I know,&#34; Tantalus continued, raising his&#160;voice, &#34;that these races were discontinued&#160;<br/>some&#160;years ago due to, ah, technical problems.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Three deaths and twenty-six mutilations,&#34; someone at the Apollo table called.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, yes!&#34; Tantalus said. &#34;But&#160;I know that you will all join me&#160;in welcoming the return of&#160;<br/>this camp&#160;tradition. Golden laurels will go to&#160;the winning charioteers each month. Teams may&#160;<br/>register in the morning! The first race will be&#160;held in three days&#160;time. We&#160;will release&#160;you&#160;<br/>from&#160;most of your regular activities to prepare your chariots and choose your horses. Oh, and&#160;<br/>did I mention, the victorious team's&#160;cabin will&#160;have no chores for the month in which they&#160;<br/>win?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>An explosion of excited conversation—no KP for&#160;a whole month?&#160;No stable cleaning?&#160;Was&#160;<br/>he serious?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then the last person I expected to object did so.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But, sir!&#34; Clarisse said. She&#160;looked nervous, but she stood up to&#160;speak from&#160;the Ares table.&#160;<br/>Some&#160;of the campers snickered when they saw the YOU MOO, GIRL! sign on her back.&#160;<br/>&#34;What about patrol duty? I mean, if we&#160;drop every-thing to ready our chariots—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah, the hero of the day,&#34; Tantalus exclaimed.&#160;&#34;Brave Clarisse, who single-handedly bested&#160;<br/>the bronze bulls!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse blinked, then blushed. &#34;Um,&#160;I didn't—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And modest, too.&#34; Tantalus grinned. &#34;Not to worry, my&#160;dear! This is a summer camp. We&#160;are&#160;<br/>here to enjoy our-selves, yes?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But the tree—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And now,&#34; Tantalus said, as several of Clarisse's&#160;cabin mates pulled her back into her seat,&#160;<br/>&#34;before we proceed to the campfire and sing-along, one slight housekeeping issue. Percy&#160;<br/>Jackson and Annabeth Chase have seen fit, for some&#160;reason, to bring this here.&#34; Tantalus&#160;<br/>waved a hand toward Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Uneasy murmuring spread among the campers. A lot&#160;of sideways looks at me. I wanted to kill&#160;<br/>Tantalus.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=38></a>&#34;Now, of course,&#34; he said, &#34;Cyclopes have a reputation for being bloodthirsty monsters with a&#160;<br/>very small brain capacity. Under normal circumstances, I would release this beast into the&#160;<br/>woods and have you hunt it down with torches&#160;and pointed sticks. But who knows?&#160;Perhaps&#160;<br/>this Cyclops&#160;is not as horrible as most of&#160;its brethren. Until it proves worthy&#160;of destruction,&#160;<br/>we need a place to keep it! I've thought about&#160;the stables, but that&#160;will make the horses&#160;<br/>nervous. Hermes's&#160;cabin, possibly?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Silence at the Hermes table.&#160;Travis and Connor Stoll developed a sudden interest in the&#160;<br/>tablecloth. I couldn't blame them. The Hermes&#160;cabin was always full to bursting. There was&#160;<br/>no way they could take in a six-foot-three Cyclops.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come now,&#34; Tantalus chided. &#34;The monster may be able to do some&#160;menial chores. Any&#160;<br/>suggestions as to where such&#160;a beast should be kenneled?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Suddenly everybody gasped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus scooted away from&#160;Tyson in surprise.&#160;All I could do was stare in disbelief at the&#160;<br/>brilliant green light that was&#160;about to change my&#160;life—a dazzling holographic image that had&#160;<br/>appeared above Tyson's&#160;head.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>With a sickening twist in my&#160;stomach, I remembered what Annabeth had said about&#160;<br/>Cyclopes, They're the children of nature spirits and gods ... Well, one god in particular,&#160;<br/>usually …&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Swirling over Tyson was a glowing green trident—the same&#160;symbol that had appeared above&#160;<br/>me&#160;the day Poseidon had claimed me as his son.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>There was a moment of awed silence.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Being claimed was a rare event. Some&#160;campers&#160;waited in vain for it their&#160;whole lives.&#160;When&#160;<br/>I'd been claimed by Poseidon last summer, everyone had reverently knelt. But now, they&#160;<br/>followed Tantalus's&#160;lead, and Tantalus roared with laughter. &#34;Well! I&#160;think we know where to&#160;<br/>put the beast now. By the gods, I can see the family resemblance!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Everybody laughed except Annabeth and a few of my&#160;other friends.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson didn't seem&#160;to notice. He was too mystified, try-ing to swat the glowing trident that&#160;<br/>was now fading over his head. He was too innocent to understand how much they were&#160;<br/>making fun of him,&#160;how cruel people were.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But I got it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I had a new cabin mate. I had a monster for a half-brother.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>SIX&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=39></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>DEMON PIGEONS&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>ATTACK&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The next few days were torture, just like Tantalus&#160;wanted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>First there was Tyson moving into the Poseidon cabin, giggling to himself every fifteen&#160;<br/>seconds and saying, &#34;Percy is my&#160;brother?&#34; like he'd&#160;just won the lottery.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Aw, Tyson,&#34; I'd say. &#34;It's not that simple.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But there was no explaining it to him.&#160;He was in&#160;heaven. And me&#160;... as much as I liked the big&#160;<br/>guy, I couldn't&#160;help feeling embarrassed. Ashamed. There, I said it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My father, the all-powerful Poseidon, had gotten moony-eyed for some&#160;nature spirit, and&#160;<br/>Tyson had been the result. I mean, I'd read the&#160;myths about Cyclopes. I even remembered that&#160;<br/>they were often Poseidon's&#160;children. But I'd never really processed that&#160;this made them my&#160;...&#160;<br/>family. Until I had Tyson living with&#160;me&#160;in the next bunk.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And then there were the comments from&#160;the other campers. Suddenly, I wasn't&#160;Percy Jackson,&#160;<br/>the cool guy who'd retrieved Zeus's&#160;lightning&#160;bolt last summer. Now I was Percy Jackson, the&#160;<br/>poor schmuck with the ugly monster for a brother.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's not my real brother!&#34; I protested whenever Tyson wasn't around. &#34;He's more like a half-<br/>brother on the monstrous side of the family. Like ... a half-brother twice removed, or&#160;<br/>something.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nobody bought it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I admit—I was angry at my&#160;dad. I felt&#160;like being his son was now a joke.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth tried to make me&#160;feel better. She suggested we team&#160;up for the chariot race&#160;to take&#160;<br/>our minds off our prob-lems. Don't get me&#160;wrong—we both hated Tantalus and we were&#160;<br/>worried sick about camp—but we didn't know what&#160;to do about it. Until we could come&#160;up&#160;<br/>with some&#160;brilliant plan to save Thalia's&#160;tree, we figured we might as well go along with the&#160;<br/>races. After all, Annabeth's&#160;mom, Athena, had&#160;invented the chariot, and my dad had created&#160;<br/>horses. Together we would own that track.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>One morning Annabeth and I were sitting by the canoe lake&#160;sketching chariot designs when&#160;<br/>some&#160;jokers from&#160;Aphrodite's&#160;cabin walked&#160;by and asked me&#160;if I needed to borrow some&#160;<br/>eyeliner for my eye ... &#34;Oh sorry, eyes.”&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As they walked away laughing, Annabeth grumbled, &#34;Just ignore them, Percy. It isn't your&#160;<br/>fault you have a monster for a brother.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's not my brother!&#34; I snapped. &#34;And he's&#160;not&#160;a monster, either!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth raised her eyebrows. &#34;Hey, don't get mad at me! And technically, he is a monster.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=40></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well you gave him&#160;permission to enter the camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Because &#160;it &#160;was &#160;the &#160;only &#160;way &#160;to &#160;save &#160;your &#160;life! &#160;I mean ... I'm&#160;sorry, Percy, I didn't&#160;<br/>expect Poseidon to claim him.&#160;Cyclopes are the most deceitful, treacherous—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He is not! What have you got&#160;against Cyclopes, any-way?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth's&#160;ears turned pink. I got the feeling&#160;there was something she wasn't&#160;telling me—<br/>something bad.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just forget&#160;it,&#34; she said.&#160;&#34;Now, the axle for this chariot—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're treating him&#160;like he's&#160;this horrible thing,&#34; I said.&#160;&#34;He saved my&#160;life.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth threw down her pencil and stood. &#34;Then maybe you should design a chariot with&#160;<br/>him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Maybe I should.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fine!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fine!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She stormed off and left me&#160;feeling even worse than before.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The next couple of days, I tried to&#160;keep my&#160;mind off my problems.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Silena Beauregard, one&#160;of the nicer girls from&#160;Aphrodite's&#160;cabin, gave me my&#160;first riding&#160;<br/>lesson on a pegasus. She explained that there was only one immortal winged horse named&#160;<br/>Pegasus, who still wandered free somewhere in the&#160;skies, but over the eons&#160;he'd&#160;sired a lot of&#160;<br/>children, none quite so fast&#160;or heroic, but all named after the first and greatest.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Being the son of the sea god, I never liked going into the air.&#160;My dad had this rivalry with&#160;<br/>Zeus, so I tried to stay out of the lord of the sky's domain as much as possible. But riding a&#160;<br/>winged horse felt different. It didn't make me&#160;nearly as nervous as being in an airplane.&#160;<br/>Maybe that was because my&#160;dad had created horses&#160;out of sea foam, so the pegasi were sort of&#160;<br/>... neutral territory. I could understand their thoughts. I wasn't&#160;surprised when my&#160;pegasus&#160;<br/>went galloping over the treetops or chased&#160;a flock of seagulls into a cloud.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The problem was that Tyson wanted to ride the &#34;chicken ponies,&#34; too, but the pegasi got&#160;<br/>skittish whenever he approached. I told them&#160;telepathically that Tyson wouldn't hurt them, but&#160;<br/>they didn't seem&#160;to believe me. That made Tyson cry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The only person at camp who had no problem&#160;with Tyson was Beckendorf from&#160;the&#160;<br/>Hephaestus cabin. The blacksmith god had always worked with Cyclopes in his forges, so&#160;<br/>Beckendorf took Tyson down to the armory to&#160;teach him&#160;metalworking. He said he'd&#160;have&#160;<br/>Tyson crafting magic items&#160;like a master in no time.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=41></a>After lunch, I worked out in the arena with Apollo's&#160;cabin. Swordplay had always been my&#160;<br/>strength. People said I was better at it than any camper in the last hundred years, except&#160;<br/>maybe Luke. People always compared me&#160;to Luke.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thrashed the Apollo guys easily. I should've been test-ing&#160;myself against the Ares and&#160;<br/>Athena cabins, since they had the best sword fighters, but I didn't get along with Clarisse and&#160;<br/>her siblings, and after my argument with Annabeth, I just didn't want to see her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I went to archery class, even though I was terrible&#160;at it, and it wasn't&#160;the same&#160;without Chiron&#160;<br/>teaching. In arts and crafts, I started a marble bust of Poseidon, but it started looking like&#160;<br/>Sylvester Stallone, so I ditched it. I scaled&#160;the climbing wall in full lava-and-earthquake&#160;<br/>mode. And in the evenings, I did border patrol.&#160;Even though Tantalus had insisted we forget&#160;<br/>trying to protect the camp, some&#160;of the campers&#160;had quietly kept it up,&#160;working out a schedule&#160;<br/>dur-ing our free times.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I sat at the top of Half-Blood Hill and watched the dryads come&#160;and go, singing to the dying&#160;<br/>pine tree. Satyrs brought their&#160;reed pipes and played nature&#160;magic songs, and for a while the&#160;<br/>pine needles seemed to get fuller. The flow-ers&#160;on&#160;the hill smelled a&#160;little sweeter and the&#160;<br/>grass looked greener. But as soon as the music&#160;stopped, the sickness crept&#160;back into the air.&#160;<br/>The whole hill seemed to be infected,&#160;dying from&#160;the poison that had sunk&#160;into the tree's&#160;<br/>roots. The longer I sat there, the angrier I got.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke had done this. I remembered his sly smile, the dragon-claw scar&#160;across his face. He'd&#160;<br/>pretended to be my&#160;friend, and the whole time&#160;he'd&#160;been Kronos's&#160;number-one servant.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I opened the palm&#160;of my hand.&#160;The scar Luke had given me&#160;last summer was fading, but I&#160;<br/>could still see it—a white asterisk-shaped wound where his pit scorpion had stung me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought about what Luke had told me&#160;right before he'd&#160;tried to kill me: Good-bye, Percy.&#160;<br/>There is a new Golden Age coming. You won't be part of it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>* * *&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>At night, I had more dreams of Grover. Sometimes,&#160;I just heard snatches of his voice. Once, I&#160;<br/>heard him&#160;say: It's&#160;here. Another time: He likes sheep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought about telling Annabeth about my&#160;dreams, but I would've felt stupid. I mean, He likes&#160;<br/>sheep?&#160;She would've thought I was crazy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The night before the race, Tyson and I finished&#160;our chariot. It was wicked cool. Tyson had&#160;<br/>made the metal parts in the armory's&#160;forges. I'd sanded the wood and put the car-riage&#160;<br/>together. It was blue and white, with wave designs on the sides and a trident painted on the&#160;<br/>front. After all that work, it seemed only fair that Tyson would ride shotgun with me, though I&#160;<br/>knew the horses wouldn't like it, and Tyson's extra weight would slow us down.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As we were turning in for bed, Tyson said, &#34;You are mad?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I realized I'd been scowling. &#34;Nah. I'm not mad.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He lay down in his bunk and was quiet in the dark. His body was way too long for his bed.&#160;<br/>When he pulled up the covers, his feet stuck out the bottom.&#160;&#34;I am&#160;a monster.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=42></a>&#34;Don't say that.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It is okay. I will be a good monster. Then you will not have to be mad.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't know what to say. I stared at the ceiling and felt like I was&#160;dying slowly, right along&#160;<br/>with Thalia's&#160;tree.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's just... I never had a half-brother before.&#34; I tried to keep my voice from cracking. &#34;It's&#160;<br/>really different for me. And I'm worried about the camp. And another friend of mine, Grover&#160;<br/>... he might be in trouble. I keep feeling like I&#160;should be doing something to help, but I don't&#160;<br/>know what.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson said nothing.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;sorry,&#34; I told him.&#160;&#34;It's not your fault. I'm&#160;mad at Poseidon. I feel like he's&#160;trying to&#160;<br/>embarrass me, like he's&#160;trying to compare us&#160;or something, and I don't understand why.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I heard a deep rumbling sound. Tyson was snoring.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I sighed. &#34;Good night, big guy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And I closed my&#160;eyes, too.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In my&#160;dream, Grover was wearing a wedding dress.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It didn't fit him&#160;very well. The gown was too&#160;long and the hem was caked with dried mud.&#160;<br/>The neckline kept falling off his shoulders. A tattered veil covered his face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He was standing in a dank cave,&#160;lit only by torches. There was a&#160;cot in one corner and an old-<br/>fashioned loom&#160;in the other, a length of white&#160;cloth half woven on the frame. And he was&#160;<br/>staring right at me, like I was&#160;a TV pro-gram&#160;he'd&#160;been waiting for. &#34;Thank the gods!&#34; he&#160;<br/>yelped. &#34;Can you hear me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My dream-self was slow to respond. I was still looking around, taking in&#160;the stalactite ceiling,&#160;<br/>the stench of sheep and goats, the growling and&#160;grumbling and bleating sounds that seemed to&#160;<br/>echo from&#160;behind a refrigerator-sized boul-der, which was blocking&#160;the room's&#160;only exit, as if&#160;<br/>there were a much larger cavern beyond it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy?&#34; Grover said. &#34;Please, I don't have the strength to project any better. You have to hear&#160;<br/>me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I hear you,&#34; I said. &#34;Grover, what's&#160;going on?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>From&#160;behind the boulder, a monstrous&#160;voice yelled, &#34;Honeypie! Are you done yet?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover flinched. He called out in falsetto,&#160;&#34;Not quite, dearest! A few more&#160;days!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Bah! Hasn't&#160;it been two weeks yet?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;N-no, dearest. Just five days. That leaves twelve more to go.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=43></a>&#160;<br/>The monster was silent, maybe trying to do the&#160;math. He must've been worse at arithmetic&#160;<br/>than I was, because he said, &#34;All right, but&#160;hurry! I want to SEEEEE under that veil, heh-heh-<br/>heh.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover turned back to me. &#34;You have to help me! No time! I'm&#160;stuck in this cave. On an&#160;<br/>island in the&#160;sea.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I don't know exactly! I went to&#160;Florida and turned left.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#160;How did you—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's a trap!&#34; Grover said.&#160;&#34;It's the reason no satyr has ever returned from&#160;this quest. He's&#160;a&#160;<br/>shepherd, Percy! And he has it.&#160;Its nature magic is so powerful it smells just like the great god&#160;<br/>Pan! The satyrs come&#160;here thinking they've&#160;found Pan, and they get trapped and eaten by&#160;<br/>Polyphemus!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Poly-who?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Cyclops!&#34; Grover said, exasperated. &#34;I almost got away. I made it all the way to St.&#160;<br/>Augustine.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But he followed you,&#34; I said, remembering my&#160;first dream.&#160;&#34;And trapped you in a bridal&#160;<br/>boutique.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's right,&#34; Grover said. &#160;&#34;My first empathy link must've worked then. Look, this bridal&#160;<br/>dress is the only thing keeping me&#160;alive. He&#160;thinks I smell good, but I told him&#160;it was just&#160;<br/>goat-scented perfume. Thank goodness he can't&#160;see very well. His eye is still half blind from&#160;<br/>the last time&#160;somebody poked it out. But soon he'll realize what I am. He's&#160;only giving me&#160;two&#160;<br/>weeks to finish the bridal train, and he's&#160;getting impatient!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait a minute. This Cyclops thinks you're—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes!&#34; Grover wailed. &#34;He thinks I'm a lady Cyclops and he wants to marry me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Under different circumstances, I might've busted out laughing, but Grover's voice was deadly&#160;<br/>serious. He was shaking with fear.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll come&#160;rescue you,&#34; I promised. &#34;Where are you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Sea of Monsters, of course!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The sea of what?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I told you! I don't know exactly where! And look, Percy ... urn, I'm&#160;really sorry about this,&#160;<br/>but this empathy link ... well, I had no choice.&#160;Our emotions are connected now. If I die ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't tell me, I'll die too.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=44></a>&#34;Oh, well, perhaps not. You might live for years&#160;in a veg-etative state.&#160;But, uh, it would be a&#160;<br/>lot better if you got&#160;me&#160;out of here.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Honeypie!&#34; the monster bellowed. &#34;Dinnertime! Yummy yummy sheep meat!&#34; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover whimpered. &#34;I have to go. Hurry!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait! You said 'it'&#160;was here. What?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But Grover's voice was already growing fainter. &#34;Sweet dreams. Don't let me&#160;die!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The dream&#160;faded and I woke with a start. It&#160;was early morning. Tyson was staring down at&#160;<br/>me, his one big brown eye full of concern.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; he asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His voice sent a chill down my&#160;back, because he&#160;sounded almost exactly like the monster I'd&#160;<br/>heard in my&#160;dream.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The morning of the race was hot and humid. Fog lay low on the ground like sauna steam.&#160;<br/>Millions of birds were roosting in&#160;the trees—fat gray-and-white pigeons, except they didn't&#160;<br/>coo like regular pigeons. They made&#160;this annoy-ing metallic screeching sound that reminded&#160;<br/>me&#160;of subma-rine&#160;radar.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The racetrack had been built in a grassy field between the archery range and the woods.&#160;<br/>Hephaestus's cabin had used the bronze bulls, which were completely tame&#160;since they'd&#160;had&#160;<br/>their heads smashed in, to plow an oval track in a matter of minutes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>There were rows of stone steps for the spectators— Tantalus, the satyrs, a few dryads, and all&#160;<br/>of the campers who weren't participating. Mr. D didn't show. He never got up before ten&#160;<br/>o'clock.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Right!&#34; Tantalus announced as&#160;the teams began to assemble. A naiad had brought him a big&#160;<br/>platter of pastries, and as Tantalus spoke, his&#160;right hand chased a chocolate eclair across the&#160;<br/>judge's&#160;table. &#34;You all know the rules. A quarter-mile track. Twice around to win. Two horses&#160;<br/>per chariot. Each team&#160;will consist of a driver&#160;and a fighter. Weapons are allowed. Dirty tricks&#160;<br/>are expected. But try not to kill anybody!&#34; Tantalus smiled at us like we were all naughty&#160;<br/>children. &#34;Any killing will result in harsh punish-ment. No s'mores at the campfire for a&#160;<br/>week! Now ready your chariots!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Beckendorf led the Hephaestus team&#160;onto the track. They had a sweet ride made of bronze&#160;<br/>and iron—even the horses, which were magical&#160;automatons like the Colchis bulls. I had no&#160;<br/>doubt that their chariot had all kinds of mechanical traps and more fancy options than a fully&#160;<br/>loaded Maserati.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Ares chariot was bloodred,&#160;and pulled by two grisly horse&#160;skeletons. Clarisse climbed&#160;<br/>aboard with a batch of javelins, spiked balls, caltrops, and a bunch&#160;of other nasty toys.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=45></a>Apollo's&#160;chariot was trim and graceful&#160;and completely gold, pulled by two beautiful&#160;<br/>palominos. Their fighter was armed with a bow,&#160;though he had promised not to shoot regular&#160;<br/>pointed arrows at the opposing drivers.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes's&#160;chariot was green and kind of old-looking, as if it hadn't been out of the garage in&#160;<br/>years. It didn't&#160;look like anything special, but it was manned by the Stoll brothers, and I&#160;<br/>shuddered to think what dirty tricks they'd&#160;schemed up.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That left&#160;two chariots: one driven&#160;by Annabeth, and the other by me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before the race began, I tried to approach&#160;Annabeth and tell her about my&#160;dream.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She perked up when I mentioned Grover, but when&#160;I told her what he'd&#160;said, she seemed to&#160;<br/>get distant again, sus-picious.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're trying to distract me,&#34; she decided.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#160;No I'm not!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, right! Like Grover would just&#160;happen to stumble across the one&#160;thing that could save the&#160;<br/>camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She rolled her eyes. &#34;Go back&#160;to your chariot, Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;not making this up. He's&#160;in trouble, Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She hesitated. I could tell she was trying to decide whether or not to&#160;trust me.&#160;Despite our&#160;<br/>occasional fights, we'd&#160;been through a lot&#160;together. And I knew she would never want&#160;<br/>anything bad to happen to Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, an empathy link is so hard to do. I mean, it's more likely you really were dreaming.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Oracle,&#34; I said. &#34;We&#160;could consult the Oracle.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth frowned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Last summer, before my&#160;quest, I'd visited the strange spirit that lived&#160;in the Big House attic&#160;<br/>and it had given me&#160;a prophecy that came true in&#160;ways I'd never expected. The experience had&#160;<br/>freaked me&#160;out for months. Annabeth knew I'd&#160;never suggest going back there if I wasn't&#160;<br/>completely seri-ous.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before she could answer, the conch horn sounded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Charioteers!&#34; Tantalus called. &#34;To your mark!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We'll talk later,&#34; Annabeth told me, &#34;after I win.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As I was walking back to my&#160;own chariot, I noticed how many more pigeons were in the trees&#160;<br/>now—screeching like crazy, making the whole&#160;forest rustle. Nobody else seemed to be&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=46></a>paying them&#160;much attention, but&#160;they made me&#160;nerv-ous. Their beaks glinted strangely. Their&#160;<br/>eyes seemed shinier than&#160;regular birds.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson was having trouble getting our horses under control. I had to talk to them&#160;a long time&#160;<br/>before they would settle down.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He's&#160;a monster, lord! they&#160;complained to me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He's&#160;a son of Poseidon, I told them. Just like ... well, just like me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No! they insisted. Monster! Horse-eater! Not trusted!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'll give you sugar cubes at the end of the race, I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sugar cubes?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Very big sugar cubes. And apples. Did I mention the apples?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Finally they agreed to let&#160;me&#160;harness them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now, if you've never seen a Greek chariot, it's built for speed, not safety or comfort. It's&#160;<br/>basically a wooden basket, open at the back,&#160;mounted on an axle between two wheels. The&#160;<br/>driver stands up the whole time, and you can feel every bump in the road. The carriage is&#160;<br/>made of such light wood that if you wipe out&#160;making the hairpin turns at either end of the&#160;<br/>track, you'll probably tip over and crush both the chariot and yourself. It's&#160;an even better rush&#160;<br/>than skate-boarding.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I took the reins and maneuvered the chariot to the start-ing line. I gave Tyson a ten-foot pole&#160;<br/>and told him that his job was to push the other&#160;chariots away if they&#160;got too close, and to&#160;<br/>deflect anything they might try to throw at us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No hitting ponies with the stick,&#34; he insisted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; I agreed. &#34;Or people, either, if you can help it. We're going to run a clean race. Just&#160;<br/>keep the distractions away and&#160;let me&#160;concentrate on driving.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We will win.'&#34; He beamed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We are so going to lose, I thought to myself, but&#160;I bad to try. I wanted to show the others ...&#160;<br/>well, I wasn't&#160;sure what, exactly. That Tyson wasn't&#160;such a bad guy?&#160;That I wasn't&#160;ashamed of&#160;<br/>being seen with him&#160;in public?&#160;Maybe that they hadn't hurt me&#160;with all their jokes and name-<br/>calling?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As the chariots lined up, more shiny-eyed pigeons gath-ered in the woods. They were&#160;<br/>screeching so loudly the campers in the stands were starting to take notice, glancing nervously&#160;<br/>at the trees, which shivered under the weight of the birds. Tantalus didn't look concerned, but&#160;<br/>he did have to speak up to be heard over the noise.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Charioteers!&#34; he shouted. &#34;Attend your mark!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He waved his hand and the starting signal dropped. The chariots roared to life. Hooves&#160;<br/>thundered against the dirt. The crowd cheered.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=47></a>&#160;<br/>Almost immediately there was a&#160;loud nasty crack! I looked back in time&#160;to see the Apollo&#160;<br/>chariot flip over. The Hermes chariot had&#160;rammed into it—maybe by mistake, maybe not. The&#160;<br/>riders were thrown free, but their panicked&#160;horses dragged the golden chariot diagonally&#160;<br/>across the track. The Hermes team, Travis and&#160;Connor Stoll, were laughing at their good luck,&#160;<br/>but not for long. The Apollo horses crashed into&#160;theirs, and the Hermes chariot flipped too,&#160;<br/>leaving a pile of broken wood and four rearing horses in the dust.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Two chariots down in the first twenty feet. I loved this sport.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I turned my&#160;attention back to the front. We&#160;were making good time, pulling ahead of Ares,&#160;<br/>but Annabeth's&#160;chariot was way ahead of us.&#160;She was already making her turn around the first&#160;<br/>post, her javelin man grinning and&#160;waving at us, shouting: &#34;See ya!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Hephaestus chariot was starting to gain on us, too.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Beckendorf pressed a button, and a panel slid open on the side of his chariot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sorry, Percy!&#34; he yelled. Three sets of balls and chains shot straight toward our wheels. They&#160;<br/>would've wrecked us completely if Tyson hadn't whacked them&#160;aside with a quick swipe of&#160;<br/>his pole. He gave the Hephaestus chariot a&#160;good shove and sent them&#160;skittering sideways&#160;<br/>while we pulled ahead.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nice work, Tyson!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Birds!&#34; he cried.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were whipping along so fast it was hard to&#160;hear or see anything, but&#160;Tyson pointed toward&#160;<br/>the woods and I saw what he was worried about.&#160;The pigeons had risen from&#160;the trees. They&#160;<br/>were spiraling like a huge tornado, heading toward the track.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No big deal, I told myself. They're just pigeons.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to concentrate on&#160;the race.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We made our first turn, the wheels creaking under us, the chariot threatening to tip, but we&#160;<br/>were now only ten feet behind Annabeth. If I could just get a little closer, Tyson could use his&#160;<br/>pole….&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth's&#160;fighter wasn't&#160;smiling now. He pulled a javelin from&#160;his collection and took aim&#160;at&#160;<br/>me. He was about to throw when we heard the screaming.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The pigeons were swarming—thousands of them&#160;dive-bombing the spectators in the stands,&#160;<br/>attacking the other chariots. Beckendorf was mobbed. His fighter tried to bat the birds away&#160;<br/>but he couldn't&#160;see anything. The chariot veered&#160;off course and plowed through the strawberry&#160;<br/>fields, the mechanical horses steaming.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Ares chariot, Clarisse barked an order to her fighter, who quickly threw a screen of&#160;<br/>camouflage netting over their basket. The birds swarmed around it, pecking and clawing at&#160;<br/>the fighter's&#160;hands as he tried to hold up the net,&#160;but Clarisse just gritted her teeth and kept&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=48></a>driving. Her skeletal horses seemed immune to&#160;the distraction. The pigeons pecked uselessly&#160;<br/>at their empty eye sockets and flew through their rib cages, but the stallions kept right on&#160;<br/>run-ning.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The spectators weren't so lucky. The birds were&#160;slashing at any bit of exposed flesh, driving&#160;<br/>everyone into a panic. Now that the birds were closer, it was clear they weren't nor-mal&#160;<br/>pigeons. Their eyes were beady and evil-looking. Their beaks were made of bronze, and&#160;<br/>judging from the yelps of the campers, they must've been razor sharp.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stymphalian birds!&#34; Annabeth yelled. She slowed down and pulled her chariot alongside&#160;<br/>mine. &#34;They'll strip everyone to bones&#160;if we don't drive them&#160;away!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson,&#34; I said, &#34;we're turning around!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Going the wrong way?&#34; he asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Always,&#34; I grumbled, but I steered&#160;the chariot toward the stands.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth rode right next to&#160;me. She shouted, &#34;Heroes, to arms!&#34; But I wasn't&#160;sure anyone&#160;<br/>could hear her over the screeching of&#160;the birds and the general chaos.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I held my&#160;reins in one hand and managed to draw&#160;Riptide as a wave of birds dived at my face,&#160;<br/>their metal beaks snapping. I slashed them&#160;out&#160;of the air and they&#160;exploded into dust and&#160;<br/>feathers, but there were still millions of&#160;them&#160;left. One nailed me&#160;in the back end and I&#160;almost&#160;<br/>jumped straight out of the chariot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth wasn't&#160;having much better luck. The closer we got to the stands, the thicker the&#160;<br/>cloud of birds became.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Some&#160;of the spectators were trying to fight&#160;back. The Athena campers were calling for&#160;<br/>shields. The archers from Apollo's&#160;cabin brought&#160;out their bows and arrows, ready to slay the&#160;<br/>menace, but with so many campers mixed in&#160;with the birds, it wasn't&#160;safe to shoot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Too many!&#34; I yelled to Annabeth.&#160;&#34;How do you get rid of them?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She stabbed at a pigeon with her knife. &#34;Hercules used noise!&#160;Brass bells! He scared them&#160;<br/>away with the most hor-rible sound he could—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Her eyes got wide. &#34;Percy ... Chiron's collection!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I understood instantly.&#160;&#34;You think it'll work?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She handed her fighter the reins and leaped from&#160;her chariot into mine like it was the easiest&#160;<br/>thing in the world. &#34;To the Big House! It's&#160;our only chance!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse has just pulled across the finish line,&#160;completely unopposed, and seemed to notice for&#160;<br/>the first time how serious the bird problem&#160;was.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When she saw us driving away, she yelled, &#34;You're run-ning? The fight&#160;is here, cowards!&#34;&#160;<br/>She drew her sword and charged for the stands.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=49></a>I urged our horses into a gallop.&#160;The chariot rumbled through the strawberry&#160;fields, across the&#160;<br/>volleyball pit, and lurched to a&#160;halt in front of the Big House. Annabeth and I ran inside,&#160;<br/>tearing down the hallway to Chiron's apart-ment.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His boom&#160;box was still on his nightstand. So were his favorite CDs. I grabbed the most&#160;<br/>repulsive one I could find, Annabeth snatched the boom&#160;box, and together we ran back&#160;<br/>outside.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Down at the track, the chariots were in flames. Wounded campers ran in&#160;every direction, with&#160;<br/>birds shred-ding their clothes&#160;and pulling out their hair, while Tantalus chased breakfast&#160;<br/>pastries around the stands, every once in a while yelling, &#34;Everything's under control! Not to&#160;<br/>worry.'&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We pulled up to the finish line. Annabeth&#160;got the boom&#160;box ready. I&#160;prayed the batteries&#160;<br/>weren't dead.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I pressed PLAY and started up Chiron's&#160;favorite—the All-Time&#160;Greatest Hits of Dean Martin.&#160;<br/>Suddenly the air was filled with violins&#160;and a bunch of guys moaning in Italian.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The demon pigeons went nuts. They&#160;started flying in circles, running into each other like they&#160;<br/>wanted to bash their own brains out. Then&#160;they abandoned the track alto-gether and flew&#160;<br/>skyward in a huge dark wave.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Now!&#34; shouted Annabeth. &#34;Archers!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>With clear targets, Apollo's&#160;archers had flawless aim.&#160;Most of them&#160;could nock five or six&#160;<br/>arrows at once. Within minutes, the ground was littered with dead bronze-beaked pigeons,&#160;<br/>and the survivors were a distant&#160;trail of smoke on the horizon.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The camp was saved, but the wreckage wasn't&#160;pretty. Most of the chariots had been&#160;<br/>completely destroyed. Almost everyone was&#160;wounded, bleeding from&#160;multiple bird pecks.&#160;<br/>The kids from Aphrodite's&#160;cabin were screaming because their hairdos had been ruined&#160;and&#160;<br/>their clothes pooped on.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Bravo!&#34; Tantalus said, but he&#160;wasn't&#160;looking at me&#160;or Annabeth. &#34;We have our first winner!&#34;&#160;<br/>He walked to &#34;He finish line and awarded the&#160;golden laurels for the race to a stunned-looking&#160;<br/>Clarisse.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then he turned and smiled at me. &#34;And now to&#160;punish the troublemakers who disrupted this&#160;<br/>race.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>SEVEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I ACCEPT GIFTS&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=50></a>FROM A STRANGER&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The way Tantalus saw it, the Stymphalian birds had simply been minding their own business&#160;<br/>in the woods and would not have&#160;attacked if Annabeth, Tyson, and I hadn't&#160;dis-turbed them&#160;<br/>with our bad chariot driving.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>This was so completely unfair, I told Tantalus to go chase a doughnut, which didn't help his&#160;<br/>mood. He sen-tenced us to kitchen patrol—scrubbing pots and platters&#160;all afternoon in the&#160;<br/>underground kitchen with the cleaning harpies.&#160;The harpies washed with lava instead of&#160;<br/>water, to get that extra-clean sparkle and kill&#160;ninety-nine point nine percent of all germs, so&#160;<br/>Annabeth and I had to wear asbestos gloves and aprons.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson didn't mind. He plunged his bare hands right in and started scrubbing, but Annabeth&#160;<br/>and I had to suffer through hours of hot, dangerous&#160;work, especially since there were tons of&#160;<br/>extra plates. Tantalus had ordered a special luncheon ban-quet to&#160;celebrate Clarisse's&#160;chariot&#160;<br/>victory—a full-course meal featuring&#160;country-fried Stymphalian death-bird.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The only good thing about our punishment was&#160;that it gave Annabeth and me&#160;a common&#160;<br/>enemy and lots of time to talk. After listening to my dream&#160;about Grover again, she looked&#160;<br/>like she might be starting&#160;to believe me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;If he's&#160;really found it,&#34; she murmured, &#34;and if we could retrieve it—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hold on,&#34; I said. &#34;You act like this ... whatever-it-is Grover found is&#160;the only thing in the&#160;<br/>world that could save&#160;the camp. What is it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll give you a hint. What do you get when you skin a ram?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Messy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She sighed. &#34;A fleece. The coat of a ram&#160;is called&#160;a fleece. And if that ram happens to have&#160;<br/>golden wool—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Golden Fleece. Are you serious?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth scrapped a plateful of death-bird bones into the lava. &#34;Percy, remember the Gray&#160;<br/>Sisters?&#160;They said they knew the location of&#160;the thing you seek. And they men-tioned Jason.&#160;<br/>Three thousand years ago, they told him&#160;how to find the Golden Fleece. You do know the&#160;<br/>story of Jason and the Argonauts?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said. &#34;That old movie with the clay skeletons.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth rolled her eyes. &#34;Oh my&#160;gods, Percy! You are so hopeless.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; I demanded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just listen. The real story of&#160;the Fleece: there were these two children of Zeus, Cadmus and&#160;<br/>Europa, okay?&#160;They were about to get offered&#160;up as human sacrifices, when they prayed to&#160;<br/>Zeus to save them. So Zeus sent this magical flying ram&#160;with golden wool, which picked&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=51></a>them&#160;up in Greece and carried them all the way&#160;to Colchis in&#160;Asia Minor.&#160;Well, actually it&#160;<br/>carried Cadmus. Europa fell off and died&#160;along the way, but that's&#160;not important.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It was probably important to her.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The point is, when Cadmus got&#160;to Colchis, he sacrificed&#160;the golden ram to the gods and hung&#160;<br/>the Fleece in&#160;a tree in the middle of the&#160;kingdom. The Fleece brought prosperity to the land.&#160;<br/>Animals stopped getting sick. Plants grew bet-ter. Farmers had bumper crops. Plagues never&#160;<br/>visited. That's&#160;why Jason wanted the Fleece. It&#160;can revitalize any land where it's&#160;placed. It&#160;<br/>cures sickness, strengthens nature, cleans up pollution—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It could cure Thalia's&#160;tree.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth nodded. &#34;And it would totally strengthen the borders of Camp&#160;Half-Blood. But&#160;<br/>Percy, the Fleece has been missing for centuries. Tons of heroes have searched for it with no&#160;<br/>luck.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But Grover found it,&#34; I said. &#34;He went looking for Pan and he found the Fleece instead&#160;<br/>because they both radiate nature magic. It makes sense, Annabeth. We&#160;can rescue&#160;him and&#160;<br/>save the camp at the same&#160;time. It's&#160;perfect!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth hesitated. &#34;A little too perfect, don't you think?&#160;What if it's a trap?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I remembered last summer, how Kronos had manipu-lated our quest. He'd&#160;almost fooled us&#160;<br/>into helping him&#160;start a war that would've destroyed Western Civilization.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What choice do we have?&#34; I asked. &#34;Are you going to help me&#160;rescue Grover or not?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She glanced at Tyson, who'd lost interest in&#160;our conver-sation and was happily making toy&#160;<br/>boats out of cups and spoons in the lava.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; she said under her breath, &#34;we'll have&#160;to fight a Cyclops. Polyphemus, the worst of&#160;<br/>the Cyclopes. And there's only one place his island could be.&#160;The Sea of Monsters.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where's&#160;that?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She stared at me&#160;like she thought I was playing dumb. &#34;The Sea of Monsters. The same&#160;sea&#160;<br/>Odysseus sailed through, and Jason,&#160;and Aeneas, and all the others.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You mean the Mediterranean?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No. Well, yes ... but no.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Another straight answer. Thanks.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Look, Percy, the Sea of Monsters is the sea all heroes sail through on&#160;their adventures. It&#160;<br/>used to be in&#160;the Mediterranean, yes. But like everything else,&#160;it shifts loca-tions as the West's&#160;<br/>center of power shifts.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Like Mount Olympus being above the Empire&#160;State Building,&#34; I said. &#34;And Hades being&#160;<br/>under Los Angeles.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=52></a>&#34;Right.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But a whole sea full of monsters—how could you hide something like that?&#160;Wouldn't&#160;the&#160;<br/>mortals notice weird things happening ...&#160;like, ships getting eaten and stuff?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Of course they notice. They don't understand, but they know something is strange about that&#160;<br/>part of the ocean. The Sea of Monsters is off the east coast of&#160;the U.S. now, just northeast of&#160;<br/>Florida. The mortals even have a name&#160;for it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Bermuda Triangle?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Exactly.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I let that sink in. I guess it wasn't&#160;stranger than any-thing else I'd&#160;learned since coming to&#160;<br/>Camp&#160;Half-Blood. &#34;Okay ... so at least we know where to look.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's still a huge area, Percy. Searching for&#160;one tiny island in monster-infested waters—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey, I'm&#160;the son of the sea god. This is&#160;my&#160;home turf. How hard can it be?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth knit her eyebrows. &#34;We'll have to talk&#160;to Tantalus, get approval for a quest. He'll&#160;<br/>say no.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not if we tell him&#160;tonight at the campfire&#160;in front of everybody. The whole camp will hear.&#160;<br/>They'll pressure him.&#160;He won't be able to refuse.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Maybe.&#34; A little bit of&#160;hope crept into Annabeth's voice.&#160;&#34;We'd better get these dishes done.&#160;<br/>Hand me&#160;the lava spray gun, will you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That night at the campfire, Apollo's&#160;cabin&#160;led the sing-along. They tried to get everybody's&#160;<br/>spirits up, but it wasn't&#160;easy after that afternoon's bird attack. We all sat around a semicircle of&#160;<br/>stone steps, singing halfheartedly and watch-ing the bonfire blaze while the Apollo guys&#160;<br/>strummed their guitars and picked their lyres.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We did all the standard camp&#160;numbers: &#34;Down by the Aegean,&#34;&#160;&#34;I Am&#160;My Own Great-Great-<br/>Great-Great-Grandpa,&#34; &#34;This Land is Minos's&#160;Land.&#34; The bonfire was enchanted, so the&#160;<br/>louder you sang, the higher it rose, chang-ing color and heat with the mood of the crowd. On&#160;<br/>a good night, I'd seen it twenty feet high, bright&#160;purple, and so hot the whole front row's&#160;<br/>marshmallows burst into the flames. Tonight, the fire was only five&#160;feet high, barely warm,&#160;<br/>and the flames were the color of lint.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Dionysus left early. After suffering through a&#160;few songs, he muttered something about how&#160;<br/>even pinochle with Chiron had been more exciting than this. Then he gave Tantalus a&#160;<br/>dis-tasteful look and headed back toward the Big House.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When the last song was over, Tantalus&#160;said, &#34;Well, that was lovely!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He came forward with a toasted marshmallow on a&#160;stick and tried to pluck&#160;it off, real casual-<br/>like. But before he could touch it, the marshmallow flew off the stick. Tantalus made a wild&#160;<br/>grab, but the&#160;marshmallow committed suicide, diving into the&#160;flames.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=53></a>&#160;<br/>Tantalus turned back toward us, smiling&#160;coldly. &#34;Now then! Some&#160;announcements about&#160;<br/>tomorrow's schedule.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sir,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus's&#160;eye twitched. &#34;Our kitchen boy has some-thing to say?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Some&#160;of the Ares campers snickered, but I&#160;wasn't&#160;going to let anybody embarrass me&#160;into&#160;<br/>silence. I stood and looked at Annabeth. Thank the gods, she stood up with me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I said, &#34;We have an idea to save the camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Dead silence, but I could tell I'd gotten everybody's interest, because the campfire flared&#160;<br/>bright yellow.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Indeed,&#34; Tantalus said blandly. &#34;Well,&#160;if it has anything to&#160;do with chariots—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Golden Fleece,&#34; I said. &#34;We know where it is.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The flames burned orange. Before Tantalus&#160;could stop me, I blurted out my dream&#160;about&#160;<br/>Grover and Polyphemus's island. Annabeth stepped in and reminded everybody what the&#160;<br/>Fleece could&#160;do. It sounded more convincing coming from&#160;her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Fleece can save the camp,&#34; she concluded. &#34;I'm&#160;certain of it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nonsense,&#34; said Tantalus. &#34;We don't need saving.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Everybody stared at him&#160;until Tantalus started looking uncomfortable.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Besides,&#34; he added quickly, &#34;the Sea of Monsters?&#160;That's&#160;hardly an exact location. You&#160;<br/>wouldn't even know where to look.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, I would,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth leaned toward me&#160;and whispered, &#34;You would?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded, because Annabeth had jogged something in my&#160;memory when she reminded me&#160;<br/>about our taxi drive with&#160;the Gray Sisters. At the time, the information they'd&#160;given me made&#160;<br/>no sense. But now ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;30, 31, 75, 12,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ooo-kay,&#34; Tantalus said. &#34;Thank you for&#160;sharing those meaningless numbers.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They're sailing coordinates,&#34; I&#160;said. &#34;Latitude and longitude. I,&#160;uh, learned about it in social&#160;<br/>studies.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Even Annabeth looked impressed. &#34;30 degrees, 31 minutes north, 75 degrees, 12 minutes&#160;<br/>west. He's&#160;right! The Gray Sisters gave us those coordinates. That'd&#160;be somewhere in the&#160;<br/>Atlantic, off&#160;the coast of&#160;Florida. The Sea of Monsters. We&#160;need a quest!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=54></a>&#34;Wait just a minute,&#34; Tantalus said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But the campers took up the chant. &#34;We need a quest! We&#160;need a quest!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The flames rose higher.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It isn't necessary!&#34;&#160;Tantalus insisted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;WE NEED&#160;A QUEST! WE NEED A QUEST!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fine!&#34; Tantalus shouted, his eyes blazing with&#160;anger. &#34;You brats want me&#160;to assign a quest?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;YES!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Very well,&#34; he agreed. &#34;I shall authorize a champion to undertake this perilous journey, to&#160;<br/>retrieve the Golden Fleece and bring it back to camp. Or die trying.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My heart filled with excitement. I wasn't&#160;going to let Tantalus scare me. This was what I&#160;<br/>needed to do. I was going to save Grover and the camp. Nothing would stop me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I will allow our champion to consult the&#160;Oracle!&#34; Tantalus announced. &#34;And choose two&#160;<br/>companions for the journey. And I think the choice of champion is obvious.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus looked at Annabeth and me&#160;as if he&#160;wanted to flay us alive. &#34;The champion should&#160;<br/>be one who has earned the camp's respect, who has proven resourceful in&#160;the char-iot&#160;races&#160;<br/>and courageous in the defense of the camp.&#160;You shall lead this&#160;quest ... Clarisse!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The fire flickered a thousand different colors. The Ares cabin&#160;started stomping and cheering,&#160;<br/>&#34;CLARISSE! CLARISSE!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse stood up, looking stunned. Then she swallowed, and her chest swelled with pride. &#34;I&#160;<br/>accept the quest!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait!&#34; I shouted. &#34;Grover is my&#160;friend. The dream&#160;came&#160;to me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sit down!&#34; yelled one of the Ares campers. &#34;You had&#160;your chance last summer!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, he just wants to be in the spotlight again!&#34; another said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse&#160;glared at me. &#34;I accept the quest!&#34; she&#160;repeated. &#34;I, Clarisse, daughter of Ares,&#160;will&#160;<br/>save the camp!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Ares campers cheered even louder. Annabeth protested, and the other Athena campers&#160;<br/>joined in. Everybody else started taking&#160;sides—shouting and arguing and throwing&#160;<br/>marshmallows. I thought it was going to turn into a full-fledged s'more war until Tantalus&#160;<br/>shouted, &#34;Silence, you brats!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His tone stunned even me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sit down!&#34; he ordered. &#34;And I&#160;will tell you a ghost story.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=55></a>I didn't know what he was up to, but we all moved&#160;reluc-tantly back to our seats. The evil aura&#160;<br/>radiating from Tantalus was as strong as any monster I'd ever faced.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Once upon a time there was a mortal king who was beloved of the Gods!&#34; Tantalus put his&#160;<br/>hand on his chest, and I got the feeling he was talking about himself.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This king,&#34; he said, &#34;was even allowed to&#160;feast on Mount Olympus. But&#160;when he tried to&#160;<br/>take some&#160;ambrosia and nectar back to earth&#160;to figure out the recipe—just one little doggie&#160;<br/>bag, mind you—the gods punished him.&#160;They banned him&#160;from&#160;their halls forever! His own&#160;<br/>people mocked him!&#160;His children scolded him!&#160;And, oh yes, campers, he had horrible&#160;<br/>children. Children—just—like— you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He pointed a crooked finger at several&#160;people in the audience, including me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Do you know what he did to his ungrateful children?&#34;&#160;Tantalus asked softly. &#34;Do you know&#160;<br/>how he paid back the gods for&#160;their cruel punishment? He invited the Olympians to a&#160;feast at&#160;<br/>his palace, just to show there were no&#160;hard feel-ings. No one noticed that his children were&#160;<br/>missing. And when he served the gods dinner,&#160;my&#160;dear campers, can you guess what was in&#160;<br/>the stew?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No one dared answer. The firelight glowed dark&#160;blue, reflecting evilly on Tantalus's&#160;crooked&#160;<br/>face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, the gods punished him&#160;in the afterlife,&#34; Tantalus croaked. &#34;They did indeed. But he'd&#160;had&#160;<br/>his moment of satisfaction, hadn't he?&#160;His children never again spoke back to him&#160;or&#160;<br/>questioned his authority. And do you know what?&#160;Rumor has it that the king's&#160;spirit now&#160;<br/>dwells at this very camp, waiting for a chance to take revenge on&#160;ungrateful, rebellious&#160;<br/>children. And so ... are there any more com-plaints, before we send Clarisse off on her quest?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Silence.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus nodded at Clarisse. &#34;The Oracle, my&#160;dear. Go on.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She shifted uncomfortably, like even&#160;she didn't want glory at the price of being Tantalus's&#160;pet.&#160;<br/>&#34;Sir—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go!&#34; he snarled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She bowed awkwardly and hurried off toward the Big House.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What about you, Percy Jackson?&#34; Tantalus asked. &#34;No comments from&#160;our dishwasher?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't say anything. I wasn't&#160;going to give&#160;him&#160;the satisfaction of punishing me&#160;again.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Good,&#34; Tantalus said. &#34;And let me&#160;remind everyone— no one leaves this camp without my&#160;<br/>permission. Anyone who tries ... well, if they survive the attempt, they will be expelled&#160;<br/>forever, but it won't come to that. The harpies&#160;will be enforcing curfew from now on, and they&#160;<br/>are always hungry! Good night,&#160;my&#160;dear campers. Sleep well.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>With a wave&#160;of Tantalus's&#160;hand, the fire was extin-guished, and the campers trailed off toward&#160;<br/>their cabins in the dark.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=56></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't explain things to Tyson. He knew I&#160;was sad. He knew I wanted to go on a trip and&#160;<br/>Tantalus wouldn't let me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You will go&#160;anyway?&#34; he asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I don't know,&#34; I admitted. &#34;It would be hard. Very hard.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I will help.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No. I—uh, I couldn't ask you to do that, big guy. Too dangerous.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson looked down at the pieces of metal he&#160;was assembling in his lap—springs and gears&#160;<br/>and tiny wires. Beckendorf had given him&#160;some&#160;tools and spare parts,&#160;and now Tyson spent&#160;<br/>every night tinkering, though I wasn't&#160;sure how&#160;his huge hands could handle such delicate&#160;<br/>little pieces.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What are you building?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson didn't answer. Instead he made a whimpering sound in the back of his throat.&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth doesn't like Cyclopes. You ... don't want me&#160;along?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, that's&#160;not it,&#34; I said halfheartedly. &#34;Annabeth likes you. Really.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He had tears in the corners of his eye.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I remembered that Grover, like all satyrs, could read human emotions. I wondered if Cyclopes&#160;<br/>had the same&#160;ability.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson folded up his tinkering project in an&#160;oilcloth. He lay down on his bunk bed and hugged&#160;<br/>his bundle like a teddy bear. When he turned toward the wall, I could see the weird scars on&#160;<br/>his back, like somebody had plowed over him&#160;with a tractor. I wondered for the millionth&#160;<br/>time how he'd&#160;gotten hurt.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Daddy always cared for m-me,&#34; he sniffled. &#34;Now ... I think he was mean&#160;to have a Cyclops&#160;<br/>boy. I should not have been born.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't talk that way! Poseidon claimed you, didn't&#160;he?&#160;So ... he must care about you ... a&#160;<br/>lot....&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My voice trailed off as I thought&#160;about all those years Tyson had lived on the streets of New&#160;<br/>York in a cardboard refrigerator box. How could Tyson think that Poseidon had cared for&#160;<br/>him?&#160;What kind of dad let that happen to&#160;his kid, even if his kid was a monster?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson ... camp will be a good home&#160;for you. The&#160;others will get used to you. I promise.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson sighed. I waited for him&#160;to say something. Then I realized he was already asleep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I lay back on my&#160;bed and tried to close my&#160;eyes, but I just couldn't. I was afraid I might have&#160;<br/>another dream about Grover. If the empathy link was real ... if something happened to Grover&#160;<br/>... would I ever wake up?&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=57></a>&#160;<br/>The full moon shone through my&#160;window. The sound&#160;of the surf rumbled in the distance. I&#160;<br/>could smell the warm&#160;scent of the strawberry fields, and hear the laughter of the dryads as&#160;<br/>they chased owls through the&#160;forest. But some-thing felt wrong about the night—the sickness&#160;<br/>of&#160;Thalia's&#160;tree, spreading across the valley.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Could Clarisse save Half-Blood Hill? I thought&#160;the odds were better of&#160;me&#160;getting a &#34;Best&#160;<br/>Camper&#34; award from&#160;Tantalus.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I got out of bed and pulled on some&#160;clothes. I grabbed a beach blanket and a six-pack of Coke&#160;<br/>from&#160;under my bunk. The Cokes were against the&#160;rules. No outside snacks or drinks were&#160;<br/>allowed, but if you talked to the right guy in Hermes's&#160;cabin and paid him a few golden&#160;<br/>drachma, he could smuggle in almost&#160;anything from&#160;the nearest conven-ience store.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sneaking out after curfew was against the rules, too. If I got&#160;caught I'd either get in big&#160;<br/>trouble or be eaten by the harpies. But I wanted&#160;to see the ocean. I always&#160;felt better there. My&#160;<br/>thoughts were clearer. I left the&#160;cabin and headed for the beach.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I spread my&#160;blanket near the surf and popped open a Coke. For some&#160;reason sugar and&#160;<br/>caffeine always calmed down my&#160;hyperactive brain.&#160;I tried to decide what to do to save the&#160;<br/>camp, but nothing came to me. I wished Poseidon&#160;would talk to me, give me&#160;some&#160;advice or&#160;<br/>something.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The sky was clear and starry. I was checking out&#160;the constellations Annabeth had taught me—<br/>Sagittarius, Hercules, Corona Borealis—when somebody said, &#34;Beau-tiful, aren't&#160;they?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I almost spewed soda.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Standing right next to me was a guy in nylon running shorts and a New York City Marathon&#160;<br/>T-shirt. He was slim&#160;and fit, with salt-and-pepper hair and a sly smile. He looked kind of&#160;<br/>familiar, but I couldn't figure out why.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My first thought was that he must've been taking a mid-night jog down the beach and strayed&#160;<br/>inside the camp bor-ders. That wasn't&#160;supposed&#160;to happen. Regular mortals couldn't enter the&#160;<br/>valley. But maybe with the tree's magic weakening&#160;he'd&#160;managed to slip in. But in the middle&#160;<br/>of the night? And there was nothing around except farmland and state preserves. Where&#160;<br/>would this guy have jogged from?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;May I join you?&#34; he asked. &#34;I&#160;haven't sat down in ages.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now, I know—a strange guy in the middle of the night. Common sense: I was supposed to&#160;<br/>run away, yell for help, etc.&#160;But the guy acted so calm&#160;about&#160;the whole thing that I found it&#160;<br/>hard to be afraid.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I said, &#34;Uh, sure.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He smiled. &#34;Your hospitality does you&#160;credit. Oh, and Coca-Cola! May I?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=58></a>He sat at the other end of&#160;the blanket, popped&#160;a soda and took a drink.&#160;&#34;Ah ... that hits the&#160;<br/>spot. Peace and quiet at—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A cell phone went off in his pocket.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The jogger sighed. He pulled out his phone and my&#160;eyes got big, because it glowed with a&#160;<br/>bluish light. When he extended the antenna,&#160;two creatures began writhing around it—green&#160;<br/>snakes, no bigger than earthworms.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The jogger didn't seem&#160;to notice. He checked his LCD display and cursed. &#34;I've got to take&#160;<br/>this. Just a sec ...&#34; Then&#160;into the phone: &#34;Hello?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He listened. The mini-snakes writhed up and&#160;down the antenna right next to his ear.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah,&#34; the jogger said. &#34;Listen—I know, but... I don't care if he&#160;is chained to a rock with&#160;<br/>vultures pecking at his liver, if he doesn't&#160;have a tracking number, we can't&#160;locate his&#160;<br/>package.... A gift to humankind, great... You know&#160;how many of those we deliver—Oh, never&#160;<br/>mind. Listen, just refer him to Eris&#160;in customer service. I gotta go.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He hung up. &#34;Sorry. The overnight express business is just booming. Now, as I was saying—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You have snakes on your phone.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#160;Oh, they don't bite. Say hello, George and Martha.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hello, George and Martha, a raspy&#160;male voice said inside my head.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Don't be sarcastic, said a female voice.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Why not?&#160;George demanded. I do all the real work.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, let's not go into that again!&#34; The jogger&#160;slipped his phone back into his pocket. &#34;Now,&#160;<br/>where were we ... Ah, yes. Peace and&#160;quiet.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He crossed his ankles and stared&#160;up&#160;at the stars. &#34;Been a long&#160;time since I've gotten to relax.&#160;<br/>Ever since the telegraph—rush, rush, rush.&#160;Do you have a favorite constel-lation, Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was still kind of wondering about the little green snakes he'd&#160;shoved into his jogging shorts,&#160;<br/>but I said, &#34;Uh, I like Hercules.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Why?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well ... because he had rotten luck. Even worse than mine. It makes me&#160;feel better.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The jogger chuckled. &#34;Not because he&#160;was strong&#160;and famous&#160;and all that?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're an interesting young man. And so, what now?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew immediately what he was asking. What did I intend to do about the Fleece?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=59></a>Before I could answer, Martha the snake's muffled voice came from&#160;his pocket: I have&#160;<br/>Demeter on line two.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not now,&#34; the jogger said. &#34;Tell her to leave a message.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She's not going to like that. The last time&#160;you put&#160;her off, all the flowers in the floral delivery&#160;<br/>division wilted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just tell her I'm&#160;in a meeting!&#34; The jogger rolled his eyes. &#34;Sorry again, Percy. You were&#160;<br/>saying ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um&#160;... who are you, exactly?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Haven't&#160;you guessed by now, a smart boy like you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Show him!&#160;Martha pleaded. I haven't been full-size for months.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Don't listen to her! George said.&#160;She just wants to show off!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The man took out his phone again. &#34;Original form, please.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The phone glowed a brilliant blue. It stretched into a three-foot-long wooden staff with dove&#160;<br/>wings sprouting out the top. George and Martha,&#160;now full-sized green snakes, coiled together&#160;<br/>around the middle. It was a caduceus,&#160;the symbol of Cabin Eleven.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My throat tightened. I realized who the jogger&#160;reminded me&#160;of with his elfish features, the&#160;<br/>mischievous twinkle in his eyes....&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're Luke's&#160;father,&#34; I said. &#34;Hermes.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The god pursed his lips. He stuck his caduceus in the sand like&#160;an umbrella pole. &#34;'Luke's&#160;<br/>father.'&#160;Normally, that's&#160;not the first way people introduce me. God of thieves, yes. God of&#160;<br/>messengers and travelers, if they wish to be kind.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>God of thieves works, George said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Oh, don't mind George. Martha flicked her tongue at&#160;me. He's just bitter because Hermes likes&#160;<br/>me&#160;best.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He does not!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Does too!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Behave, you two,&#34; Hermes warned, &#34;or I'll turn you back into a cell phone and set you on&#160;<br/>vibrate! Now, Percy, you still haven't answered&#160;my question. What do you intend to do about&#160;<br/>the quest?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—I don't have permission to go.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, indeed.&#160;Will that stop you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I want to go. I have to save Grover.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=60></a>&#160;<br/>Hermes smiled. &#34;I knew a boy once ... oh, younger than you by far. A mere baby, really.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Here we go again, George said.&#160;Always talking about himself&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Quiet! Martha snapped. Do you want to get set on vibrate?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes ignored them. &#34;One night, when this boy's mother wasn't&#160;watching, he sneaked out of&#160;<br/>their cave and stole some&#160;cattle that belonged to Apollo.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Did he get blasted to tiny pieces?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hmm&#160;... no. Actually, everything&#160;turned out quite well. To make up for his theft, the boy&#160;<br/>gave Apollo an instrument he'd&#160;invented—a&#160;lyre. Apollo was so enchanted with the music&#160;<br/>that he forgot all about being angry.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;So what's&#160;the moral?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The moral?&#34; Hermes asked. &#34;Goodness, you act like&#160;it's a fable. It's&#160;a true story. Does truth&#160;<br/>have a moral?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um&#160;...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How about this: stealing is not always bad?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I don't think my&#160;mom would like that moral.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Rats are delicious, suggested George.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>What does that have to do with&#160;the story?&#160;Martha demanded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nothing, George said. But I'm&#160;hungry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I've got it,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;Young people don't always do what they're told, but if they can&#160;<br/>pull it off and do something wonderful, sometimes they escape punishment. How's that?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're saying I should go anyway,&#34; I&#160;said, &#34;even with-out permission.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes's&#160;eyes twinkled. &#34;Martha, may I have the first package, please?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Martha opened her mouth ... and kept opening it&#160;until it was as wide as my arm.&#160;She belched&#160;<br/>out a stainless steel canister—an old-fashioned lunch box thermos with a black plastic top.&#160;<br/>The sides of the thermos were enameled with&#160;red and yellow Ancient Greek scenes—a hero&#160;<br/>killing a lion; a hero lifting up&#160;Cerberus, the three-headed dog.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's Hercules,&#34; I said. &#34;But how—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Never question a gift,&#34; Hermes chided. &#34;This&#160;is a col-lector's&#160;item&#160;from&#160;Hercules Busts&#160;<br/>Heads. The first season.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hercules Busts Heads?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=61></a>&#34;Great show.&#34; Hermes sighed. &#34;Back before&#160;Hephaestus-TV was all reality programming. Of&#160;<br/>course, the thermos would be worth much&#160;more if I had the whole lunch box—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Or if it hadn't been in Martha's&#160;mouth, George added.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'll get you for that. Martha began chasing him&#160;around the caduceus.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait a minute,&#34; I said. &#34;This is a gift?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;One of two,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;Go on, pick it up.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I almost dropped it because it was freezing cold&#160;on one side and burning hot on the other. The&#160;<br/>weird thing was, when I turned the thermos,&#160;the side facing the ocean— north—was always&#160;<br/>the cold side....&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's a compass!&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes looked surprised. &#34;Very clever. I never&#160;thought of that. But its intended use is a bit&#160;<br/>more dramatic. Uncap it, and you will release the&#160;winds from&#160;the four corners of the earth to&#160;<br/>speed you on your way. Not now! And please, when the time&#160;comes, only unscrew the lid a&#160;<br/>tiny bit. The winds are a bit like me—always restless. Should all four escape at once ... ah, but&#160;<br/>I'm&#160;sure you'll be careful. And&#160;now my second gift. George?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She's touching me, George complained as&#160;he and Martha slithered around the pole.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;She's&#160;always touching you,&#34; Hermes&#160;said. &#34;You're inter-twined. And&#160;if you don't stop that,&#160;<br/>you'll get knotted again!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The snakes stopped wrestling.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>George unhinged his jaw and coughed up a little plastic bottle filled with chewable vitamins.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're kidding,&#34; I said. &#34;Are those Minotaur-shaped?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes picked up the bottle and rattled it. &#34;The&#160;lemon ones, yes. The grape ones are Furies, I&#160;<br/>think. Or are they hydras?&#160;At any rate, these&#160;are potent. Don't take one unless you really,&#160;<br/>really need it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How will I know if I really, really need it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You'll know, believe me. Nine essential vitamins, min-erals, amino acids ... oh, everything&#160;<br/>you need to feel your-self again.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He tossed me the bottle.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um,&#160;thanks,&#34; I said. &#34;But Lord&#160;Hermes, why are you helping me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He gave me&#160;a melancholy smile. &#34;Perhaps because I hope that you can save many people on&#160;<br/>this quest, Percy. Not just your friend Grover.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at him. &#34;You don't mean ... Luke?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=62></a>Hermes didn't&#160;answer.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Look,&#34; I said. &#34;Lord Hermes, I mean, thanks and everything, but&#160;you might as well take back&#160;<br/>your gifts. Luke can't&#160;be saved. Even if I could&#160;find him&#160;... he told me&#160;he wanted to tear down&#160;<br/>Olympus stone by stone. He betrayed everybody&#160;he knew. He—he hates you especially.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes gazed up at the stars. &#34;My dear young cousin, if there's one thing&#160;I've learned&#160;over the&#160;<br/>eons, it's that you can't&#160;give up on your family, no matter how tempting they make it. It&#160;<br/>doesn't&#160;matter if they hate you, or embarrass&#160;you, or simply don't appreciate your genius for&#160;<br/>inventing the Internet—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You invented the Internet?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was my&#160;idea, Martha said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Rats are delicious, George said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It was my&#160;idea!&#34; Hermes said. &#34;I&#160;mean the Internet, not the rats. But that's&#160;not the point.&#160;<br/>Percy, do you understand what I'm&#160;saying about family?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—I'm&#160;not sure.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You will some&#160;day.&#34; Hermes got up and brushed the sand off&#160;his legs. &#34;In the meantime, I&#160;<br/>must be going.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>You have sixty calls to return, Martha said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And one thousand-thirty-eight e-mails, George&#160;added. Not counting the offers for online&#160;<br/>discount ambrosia.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And you, Percy,&#34; Hermes said, &#34;have a shorter&#160;deadline than you realize to complete your&#160;<br/>quest. Your friends should be&#160;coming right about ... now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I heard Annabeth's&#160;voice calling my&#160;name&#160;from&#160;the sand dunes. Tyson, too, was shouting&#160;<br/>from&#160;a little bit farther away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I hope I packed well for you,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;I&#160;do have some experience with travel.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He snapped his fingers and three yellow duffel&#160;bags appeared at my&#160;feet. &#34;Waterproof, of&#160;<br/>course. If you ask nicely,&#160;your father should be able to help you reach the ship.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ship?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes pointed. Sure enough, a big cruise ship was cutting across&#160;Long Island Sound, its&#160;<br/>white-and-gold lights glowing&#160;against the dark water.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait,&#34; I said. &#34;I don't understand any of&#160;this. I haven't even agreed to go!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'd&#160;make up your mind in the next five minutes, if I were you,&#34; Hermes advised. &#34;That's&#160;<br/>when the harpies will come&#160;to eat you. Now, good night, cousin, and dare I say it?&#160;May the&#160;<br/>gods go with you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=63></a>He opened his hand and the caduceus flew into it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Good luck, Martha told me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Bring me&#160;back a rat, George said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The caduceus changed into a cell phone and Hermes slipped it into his pocket.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He jogged off down the beach. Twenty paces away, he shimmered and vanished, leaving me&#160;<br/>alone with a thermos, a bottle of chewable vitamins, and five minutes to make an impossible&#160;<br/>decision.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>EIGHT&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WE BOARD THE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>PRINCESS&#160;ANDROMEDA&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was staring at the waves when Annabeth and Tyson found me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What's going on?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;&#34;I heard you call-ing for help!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Me, too!&#34; Tyson said. &#34;Heard you yell,&#160;'Bad things are attacking!'&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I didn't call you guys,&#34; I said. &#34;I'm&#160;fine.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But then who ...&#34; Annabeth noticed the three yellow duffel bags, then the thermos and the&#160;<br/>bottle of vitamins I was holding. &#34;What—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just listen,&#34; I said. &#34;We don't have much time.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I told them&#160;about my&#160;conversation with Hermes. By the time I was finished, I could hear&#160;<br/>screeching in the distance—patrol&#160;harpies picking up our scent.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;we have to do the quest.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We'll get expelled, you know. Trust me, I'm an expert at getting expelled.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;So?&#160;If we fail, there won't be&#160;any camp to come&#160;back to.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, but you promised Chiron—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=64></a>&#34;I promised I'd keep you from&#160;danger. I can only do that by coming with you! Tyson can stay&#160;<br/>behind and tell them—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I want to go,&#34; Tyson said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Annabeth's&#160;voice sounded close to panic.&#160;&#34;I mean ... Percy, come&#160;on. You know that's&#160;<br/>impossible.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wondered again why she had such a grudge&#160;against Cyclopes. There was something she&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;telling me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She and Tyson both looked at me, waiting for&#160;an answer. Meanwhile, the cruise ship was&#160;<br/>getting farther and farther away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The thing was, part of me didn't want Tyson&#160;along. I'd spent the last three days in close&#160;<br/>quarters with the guy, get-ting razzed by the other campers and embarrassed a million times a&#160;<br/>day, constantly reminded that I was related to him. I needed some&#160;space.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Plus, I didn't know how much help he'd&#160;be, or&#160;how I'd keep him&#160;safe. Sure, he was strong, but&#160;<br/>Tyson was a little kid in Cyclops terms, maybe&#160;seven or eight years old, mentally. I could see&#160;<br/>him&#160;freaking out and starting to&#160;cry while we were trying to&#160;sneak past a monster or&#160;<br/>something. He'd&#160;get us all killed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>On the other hand, the sound of the harpies was getting closer....&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We can't&#160;leave him,&#34; I decided. &#34;Tantalus will punish him&#160;for us being gone.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth said, trying to keep her cool, &#34;we're going to Polyphemus's island!&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;is an S-i-k ... a C-y-k . ..&#34; She stamped her foot in frustration. As smart as she&#160;<br/>was, Annabeth was dyslexic, too. We&#160;could've&#160;been there all night while she tried to spell&#160;<br/>Cyclops. &#34;You know what I mean!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson can go,&#34; I insisted, &#34;if he wants to.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson clapped his hands. &#34;Want to!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth gave me&#160;the evil eye, but I guess she could tell I wasn't&#160;going to change my&#160;mind.&#160;<br/>Or maybe she just knew we didn't have time to argue.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;All right,&#34; she said. &#34;How&#160;do we get to that ship?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hermes said my&#160;father would help.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well then, Seaweed Brain?&#160;What are you waiting for?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'd always had a hard time&#160;calling on my&#160;father, or pray-ing, or whatever you want to call it,&#160;<br/>but I stepped into the waves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Urn, Dad?&#34; I called. &#34;How's&#160;it going?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=65></a>&#34;Percy!&#34; Annabeth whispered. &#34;We're&#160;in a hurry!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We need your help,&#34; I called a little louder. &#34;We need to get to&#160;that ship, like, before we get&#160;<br/>eaten and stuff, so ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>At first, nothing happened. Waves crashed against the shore like normal. The harpies sounded&#160;<br/>like they were right behind the sand dunes. Then, about a hundred yards out to sea, three&#160;<br/>white lines appeared on the surface. They moved&#160;fast toward the shore, like claws ripping&#160;<br/>through the ocean.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As they neared the beach,&#160;the surf burst apart&#160;and the heads of three white stallions reared out&#160;<br/>of the waves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson caught his breath. &#34;Fish ponies!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He was right. As the creatures pulled themselves&#160;onto the sand, I saw that they were only&#160;<br/>horses in the front; their back halves were silvery fish bodies, with&#160;glistening scales and&#160;<br/>rainbow tail fins.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hippocampi!&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;They're beautiful.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The nearest one whinnied in appreciation and nuzzled Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We'll admire them&#160;later,&#34; I said. &#34;Come on!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;There!&#34; a voice screeched behind us. &#34;Bad&#160;children out of cabins! Snack time for lucky&#160;<br/>harpies!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Five of them were fluttering&#160;over the top of the dunes—plump&#160;little hags with pinched faces&#160;<br/>and talons and feathery wings too small for&#160;their bodies. They reminded me&#160;of miniature&#160;<br/>cafeteria ladies who'd been crossbred with dodo&#160;birds. They weren't very fast, thank the gods,&#160;<br/>but they were vicious if they caught you.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I said. &#34;Grab a duffel bag!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He was still staring at the hippocampi&#160;with his mouth hanging open, &#34;Tyson!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Uh?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come on!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>With Annabeth's&#160;help I got him&#160;moving. We&#160;gathered the bags and mounted our steeds.&#160;<br/>Poseidon must've known Tyson was one of the passengers, because one hippocampus was&#160;<br/>much larger than the other two—just right for carrying a Cyclops.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Giddyup!&#34; I said. My hippocampus turned and&#160;plunged into the waves. Annabeth's&#160;and&#160;<br/>Tyson's followed right behind.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The harpies cursed at us,&#160;wailing for their snacks to come&#160;back, but the hippocampi raced&#160;<br/>over the water at the speed of Jet Skis. The harpies fell behind, and soon the shore of Camp&#160;<br/>Half-Blood was nothing but a dark smudge. I wondered if I'd ever see the place again. But&#160;<br/>right then I had other problems.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=66></a>&#160;<br/>The cruise ship was now looming in front of&#160;us—our ride toward Florida and the Sea of&#160;<br/>Monsters.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Riding the hippocampus was even easier than&#160;riding a pegasus. We&#160;zipped along with the&#160;<br/>wind in our faces, speeding through the waves so&#160;smooth and steady I hardly needed to hold&#160;<br/>on at all.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As we got closer to the cruise&#160;ship, I realized just how huge&#160;it was. I felt as though I were&#160;<br/>looking up at a building in Manhattan. The white hull was at least ten stories tall, topped with&#160;<br/>another dozen levels of decks with brightly lit balconies and portholes. The ship's&#160;name&#160;was&#160;<br/>painted just above the bow line in black letters,&#160;lit with a spotlight. It&#160;took me&#160;a few seconds&#160;<br/>to decipher it: PRINCESS&#160;ANDROMEDA&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Attached to the bow was a huge masthead—a three-story-tall woman&#160;wearing a white Greek&#160;<br/>chiton, sculpted to look as if she were chained to the front of the ship. She was young and&#160;<br/>beautiful, with flowing black hair, but her&#160;expression was one of absolute terror. Why&#160;<br/>anybody would want a screaming princess on the front of their vacation&#160;ship, I had no idea.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I remembered the myth about Andromeda and how she had been chained to a rock by her own&#160;<br/>parents as a sac-rifice to a sea monster. Maybe&#160;she'd gotten too many F's on her report card or&#160;<br/>something. Anyway, my name-sake, Perseus, had&#160;saved her just in time&#160;and turned the sea&#160;<br/>monster to stone using the head of Medusa.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That Perseus always won. That's&#160;why my&#160;mom had named me after him,&#160;even though he was&#160;<br/>a son of Zeus and I was a son of Poseidon. The original Perseus was one of the only heroes in&#160;<br/>the Greek myths who got a happy ending. The others died—betrayed, mauled, mutilated,&#160;<br/>poisoned, or cursed by the gods. My mom&#160;hoped&#160;I would inherit Perseus's luck. Judging by&#160;<br/>how my&#160;life was going so far, I wasn't&#160;real optimistic.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How do we&#160;get aboard?&#34; Annabeth shouted over the noise of the waves, but the hippocampi&#160;<br/>seemed to know what we needed. They skimmed along the starboard side of the ship, riding&#160;<br/>easily through its huge wake, and pulled up next to&#160;a service ladder riveted to the side of the&#160;<br/>hull.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You first,&#34; I told Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She slung her duffel bag over her shoulder and grabbed the bottom&#160;rung. Once she'd hoisted&#160;<br/>herself onto the lad-der, her hippocampus&#160;whinnied a farewell and dove under-water.&#160;<br/>Annabeth began to climb. I let her get a few rungs up, then followed her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Finally it was just Tyson in the water. His&#160;hippocampus was treating him&#160;to 360° aerials and&#160;<br/>backward ollies, and Tyson was laughing so hysterically, the sound echoed up the side of the&#160;<br/>ship.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson, shhh!&#34; I said. &#34;Come on, big guy!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Can't&#160;we take Rainbow?&#34; he asked, his smile fading.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at him. &#34;Rainbow?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The hippocampus whinnied as&#160;if he liked his new name.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=67></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um,&#160;we have to go,&#34; I said. &#34;Rainbow ... well, he can't&#160;climb ladders.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson sniffled. He buried his face in the hippocampus's&#160;mane. &#34;I will miss you, Rainbow!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The hippocampus made a neighing sound I could've sworn was crying.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Maybe we'll see him&#160;again sometime,&#34; I suggested.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, please!&#34; Tyson said, perking up immediately. &#34;Tomorrow!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't make any promises, but I finally convinced Tyson to say his farewells and grab hold&#160;<br/>of the ladder. With a final sad whinny, Rainbow the hippocampus did a back-flip and dove&#160;<br/>into the sea.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The ladder led to a maintenance deck stacked with&#160;yellow lifeboats. There was a set of locked&#160;<br/>double doors, which Annabeth managed to pry open with her knife and a fair amount of&#160;<br/>cursing in Ancient Greek.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I figured we'd&#160;have to sneak around, being stowaways and all, but after checking a few&#160;<br/>corridors and peering over a bal-cony into a huge central promenade lined with closed shops,&#160;<br/>I began to realize there was nobody to hide from.&#160;I&#160;mean, sure it was the middle of the night,&#160;<br/>but we walked half the length of the boat and&#160;met no one. We&#160;passed forty or fifty cabin doors&#160;<br/>and heard no sound behind any of them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's a ghost ship,&#34; I murmured.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; Tyson said, fiddling with the strap of his duffel bag. &#34;Bad smell.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth frowned. &#34;I don't smell anything.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Cyclopes are like satyrs,&#34; I said. &#34;They can&#160;smell monsters. Isn't that right, Tyson?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He nodded nervously. Now that we were away from&#160;Camp&#160;Half-Blood, the Mist had distorted&#160;<br/>his face again. Unless I concentrated&#160;very hard, it seemed that he&#160;had two eyes instead of one.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Okay,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;So&#160;what exactly do you smell?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Something bad,&#34; Tyson answered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Great,&#34; Annabeth grumbled. &#34;That clears it up.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We came&#160;outside on the swimming&#160;pool level. There were rows&#160;of empty deck chairs and a&#160;<br/>bar closed off with a chain curtain. The water in the pool glowed eerily, sloshing back and&#160;<br/>forth from&#160;the motion of the ship.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Above us fore and aft were more levels—a climbing wall, a putt-putt golf course, a revolving&#160;<br/>restaurant, but no sign of life.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And yet ... I sensed something familiar. Something dangerous.&#160;I had the feeling that if I&#160;<br/>weren't so tired and burned out on adrenaline from our long night, I might be able to put a&#160;<br/>name&#160;to what&#160;was wrong.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=68></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;We need a hiding place,&#34; I said. &#34;Somewhere safe to sleep.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sleep,&#34; Annabeth agreed wearily.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We explored a few more&#160;corridors until we found an empty suite on the ninth level. The door&#160;<br/>was open, which struck me&#160;as weird. There was a&#160;basket of chocolate goodies on the table, an&#160;<br/>iced-down bottle of sparkling cider on the&#160;nightstand, and a mint on the pillow with a&#160;<br/>hand-written note that said: Enjoy your cruise!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We opened our duffel bags for the first time&#160;and found that Hermes really had thought of&#160;<br/>everything—extra clothes, toiletries, camp rations, a Ziploc bag full of cash, a leather pouch&#160;<br/>full of golden drachmas. He'd&#160;even managed to pack Tyson's oilcloth with his tools and&#160;metal&#160;<br/>bits, and Annabeth's&#160;cap of invisibility,&#160;which made them&#160;both feel a lot better.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll be next door,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;&#34;You guys don't drink or eat anything.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You think this place is enchanted?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She frowned. &#34;I don't know. Something isn't right. Just ... be careful.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We locked our doors.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson crashed on the couch. He tinkered for&#160;a few min-utes on his&#160;metalworking project—<br/>which he still wouldn't show me—but soon&#160;enough he was yawning. He wrapped up his&#160;<br/>oilcloth and passed out.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I lay on the bed and stared out the porthole.&#160;I thought I heard voices out in the hallway, like&#160;<br/>whispering. I knew that couldn't be. We'd&#160;walked all over the ship and had seen nobody. But&#160;<br/>the voices kept me&#160;awake. They reminded me&#160;of&#160;my trip to the Underworld—the way the&#160;<br/>spirits of the dead sounded as they drifted past.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Finally my&#160;weariness got the best of me. I&#160;fell asleep ... and had my&#160;worst dream&#160;yet.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was standing in a cavern at the edge&#160;of an&#160;enormous pit. I knew the place too well. The&#160;<br/>entrance to Tartarus. And I recognized the cold laugh that echoed from&#160;the darkness below.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>If it isn't the young hero. The voice was like a knife blade scraping across stone. On his way&#160;<br/>to another great victory.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to shout at Kronos to leave me&#160;alone. I wanted to draw Riptide and strike him down.&#160;<br/>But I couldn't&#160;move. And even&#160;if I could, how could I kill some-thing that had already been&#160;<br/>destroyed—chopped to pieces and&#160;cast into eternal darkness?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Don't let me&#160;stop you, the titan&#160;said. Perhaps this time, when&#160;you fail, you'll wonder if it's&#160;<br/>worthwhile slaving for the gods. How exactly has your father shown his appreciation lately?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His laughter filled the cavern,&#160;and suddenly the scene changed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was a different cave—Grover's bedroom&#160;prison in the Cyclops's lair.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=69></a>Grover was sitting at the loom&#160;in his soiled wedding dress, madly unraveling the threads of&#160;<br/>the unfinished bridal train.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Honeypie!&#34; the monster shouted from behind the boulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover yelped and began weaving the threads back together.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The room&#160;shook as the boulder was pushed aside. Looming in the doorway was a Cyclops so&#160;<br/>huge he made Tyson look vertically challenged. He had jagged yellow teeth and gnarled&#160;<br/>hands as big as my&#160;whole body. He wore a faded purple T-shirt that said WORLD SHEEP&#160;<br/>EXPO 2001. He must've been at&#160;least fifteen feet tall, but the most startling thing was his&#160;<br/>enormous milky eye, scarred and&#160;webbed with cataracts. If he wasn't&#160;completely blind, he had&#160;<br/>to be pretty darn close.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;&#160;the monster demanded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nothing!&#34; Grover said in his falsetto voice. &#34;Just weav-ing my bridal train, as you can see.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Cyclops&#160;stuck one hand into the room&#160;and groped around&#160;until he&#160;found the loom. He&#160;<br/>pawed at the cloth. &#34;It hasn't&#160;gotten any longer!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, um, yes it has, dearest. See?&#160;I've added at least an inch.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Too many delays!&#34; the monster bellowed. Then&#160;he sniffed the air. &#34;You smell good! Like&#160;<br/>goats!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh.&#34; Grover forced a weak giggle. &#34;Do you like&#160;it?&#160;It's&#160;Eau de Chevre. I wore it just for&#160;<br/>you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Mmmm!&#34; The Cyclops bared his pointed teeth. &#34;Good enough to eat!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, you're such a flirt!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No more delays!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But dear, I'm not done!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tomorrow!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, no. Ten more days.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Five!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, well, seven then. If you insist.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Seven! That is less than five, right?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Certainly. Oh yes.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The monster grumbled, still not happy with his&#160;deal, but he left Grover to his weaving and&#160;<br/>rolled the boulder back into place.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=70></a>Grover closed his eyes and took a shaky breath, trying to calm his nerves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hurry, Percy,&#34; he muttered.&#160;&#34;Please,&#160;please, please!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>* * *&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I woke to a ship's&#160;whistle and a voice on the&#160;intercom— some&#160;guy with&#160;an Australian accent&#160;<br/>who sounded way too happy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Good morning, passengers! We'll be at sea all&#160;day today. Excellent weather for the poolside&#160;<br/>mambo party! Don't forget million-dollar bingo in&#160;the Kraken Lounge at one o'clock, and for&#160;<br/>our special guests, disemboweling practice on the Promenade!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I sat up in bed. &#34;What did he say?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson groaned, still half asleep. He was lying&#160;facedown on the couch, his feet so far over the&#160;<br/>edge they were in the bathroom. &#34;The happy man said ... bowling practice?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hoped he was right, but then there was an urgent knock on the suite's interior door. Annabeth&#160;<br/>stuck her head in—her blond hair in a&#160;rat's nest. &#34;Disemboweling practice?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Once we were all dressed, we ventured out into&#160;the ship and were surprised to see other&#160;<br/>people. A dozen senior citizens&#160;were heading to breakfast. A dad was taking his kids to the&#160;<br/>pool for a morning swim. Crew members in crisp white uniforms strolled the deck, tipping&#160;<br/>their hats to the passengers.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nobody asked who we were. Nobody paid us much attention. But there was something&#160;<br/>wrong.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As the family of swimmers passed us, the dad told his kids: &#34;We are on a cruise. We&#160;are&#160;<br/>having fun.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes,&#34; his three kids said&#160;in unison, their expressions blank. &#34;We are having a blast. We will&#160;<br/>swim&#160;in the pool.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They wandered off.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Good morning,&#34; a crew member told&#160;us, his&#160;eyes glazed. &#34;We&#160;are all enjoying ourselves&#160;<br/>aboard the Princess Andromeda. Have a nice day.&#34; He drifted away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, this is weird,&#34; Annabeth whispered. &#34;They're all in some&#160;kind of trance.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then we passed a cafeteria and saw our first monster. It was a hellhound—a black mastiff&#160;<br/>with its front paws up on the buffet line and its muzzle buried in the scrambled eggs. It&#160;<br/>must've been young, because it was small compared to most—no bigger than a grizzly bear.&#160;<br/>Still, my&#160;blood turned cold. I'd almost&#160;gotten killed by one of those before.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The weird thing was: a middle-aged couple was&#160;stand-ing in the buffet line right behind the&#160;<br/>devil dog, patiently waiting their turn for the eggs.&#160;They didn't&#160;seem&#160;to notice anything out of&#160;<br/>the ordinary.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not hungry anymore,&#34; Tyson murmured.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=71></a>&#160;<br/>Before Annabeth or I could reply, a reptilian voice came from down&#160;the corridor, &#34;Ssssix&#160;<br/>more joined yesssterday.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth gestured frantically&#160;toward the nearest hiding place—the women's room—and all&#160;<br/>three of us ducked inside. I was so freaked out&#160;it didn't even occur to me&#160;to be embarrassed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Something—or more like two somethings—slithered past the bathroom&#160;door, making sounds&#160;<br/>like sandpaper against the carpet.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yesss,&#34; a second reptilian voice said. &#34;He drawssss them. Ssssoon we will be&#160;sssstrong.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The things slithered into the cafeteria&#160;with&#160;a cold hiss-ing that&#160;might have been snake&#160;<br/>laughter.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth looked at me. &#34;We have to get out of here.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You think I want to be in the girls'&#160;restroom?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I mean the ship, Percy! We have to get off the ship.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Smells bad,&#34; Tyson agreed. &#34;And&#160;dogs eat all the eggs. Annabeth&#160;is right. We&#160;must leave the&#160;<br/>restroom&#160;and ship.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I shuddered. If Annabeth and Tyson were actually agree-ing about something, I figured I'd&#160;<br/>better listen.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I heard another voice outside—one that&#160;chilled me&#160;worse than any monster's.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;—only a matter of time. Don't push me, Agrius!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was Luke, beyond a doubt. I could never forget his voice.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;not pushing you!&#34; another guy growled. His&#160;voice was deeper and&#160;even angrier than&#160;<br/>Luke's. &#34;I'm just saying, if this gamble doesn't&#160;pay off—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It'll pay off,&#34; Luke snapped. &#34;They'll take the bait. Now, come, we've got to get to the&#160;<br/>admiralty suite and check on the casket.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Their voices&#160;receded down the corridor.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson whimpered. &#34;Leave now?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and I exchanged looks and came to a silent agreement.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We can't,&#34; I told Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We have to find out what Luke is up to,&#34; Annabeth agreed. &#34;And if possible, we're going to&#160;<br/>beat him&#160;up, bind him&#160;in chains, and drag him&#160;to Mount Olympus.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=72></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>NINE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I HAVE THE WORST&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>FAMILY REUNION EVER&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth volunteered to go alone since she had the cap of invisibility,&#160;but I convinced her it&#160;<br/>was too dangerous. Either we all went together, or nobody went.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nobody!&#34; Tyson voted. &#34;Please?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But in the end he came along, nervously chewing on his huge fingernails. We&#160;stopped at our&#160;<br/>cabin long enough to gather our stuff. We&#160;figured whatever happened, we would not be&#160;<br/>staying another night aboard the zombie cruise&#160;ship, even if&#160;they did have million-dollar&#160;<br/>bingo. I made sure Riptide was in my&#160;pocket and the vitamins and thermos from&#160;Hermes were&#160;<br/>at the top of my bag. I didn't want Tyson to&#160;carry everything, but he&#160;insisted, and Annabeth&#160;<br/>told me&#160;not to worry about it. Tyson could carry three full duffel bags over his shoulder as&#160;<br/>easily as I could carry a backpack.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We sneaked through the corridors, following the ship's&#160;YOU ARE HERE signs toward the&#160;<br/>admiralty suite. Annabeth scouted ahead invisibly. We&#160;hid whenever someone passed by, but&#160;<br/>most of the people we saw were just glassy-eyed zombie passengers.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As we came&#160;up the stairs to deck thirteen,&#160;where the admiralty suite was supposed to be,&#160;<br/>Annabeth hissed, &#34;Hide!&#34; and shoved us into a supply closet.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I heard a couple of guys&#160;coming down the hall.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You see that Aethiopian drakon in the cargo hold?&#34; one of them&#160;said. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The other laughed. &#34;Yeah, it's awesome.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth was still invisible, but she squeezed my&#160;arm&#160;hard. I got a feeling I should know that&#160;<br/>second guy's voice.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I hear they got two more&#160;coming,&#34; the familiar&#160;voice said. &#34;They keep arriving at this rate,&#160;<br/>oh, man—no contest!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The voices faded down the corridor.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That was Chris Rodriguez!&#34; Annabeth took off&#160;her cap and turned visible. &#34;You remember—<br/>from&#160;Cabin Eleven.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=73></a>I sort of recalled Chris from&#160;the summer before. He was one of those undetermined campers&#160;<br/>who got stuck in the Hermes cabin because his Olympian dad or mom never claimed him.&#160;<br/>Now that I thought about it, I realized I hadn't seen Chris at camp&#160;this summer. &#34;What's&#160;<br/>another half-blood doing here?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth shook her head, clearly troubled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We kept going down the corridor. I didn't need&#160;maps anymore to know I was getting close to&#160;<br/>Luke. I sensed something cold and unpleasant—the presence of evil.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy.&#34; Annabeth stopped suddenly. &#34;Look.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She stood in front of a glass wall looking down into the multistory canyon that ran through&#160;<br/>the middle of the ship. At the bottom&#160;was the Promenade—a mall full of shops— but that's&#160;<br/>not what had caught Annabeth's&#160;attention.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A group of monsters had assembled in front of&#160;the candy store: a dozen Laistrygonian giants&#160;<br/>like the ones who'd attacked me&#160;with dodge balls, two hellhounds, and a few even stranger&#160;<br/>creatures—humanoid females with twin serpent tails instead of&#160;legs.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Scythian Dracaenae,&#34; Annabeth whispered. &#34;Dragon women.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The monsters made a semicircle around a young guy in Greek armor who was hacking on a&#160;<br/>straw dummy. A lump&#160;formed in my&#160;throat&#160;when I realized the dummy was wear-ing an&#160;<br/>orange Camp Half-Blood T-shirt. As we watched, the guy in armor stabbed the dummy&#160;<br/>through its belly and ripped upward. Straw flew everywhere. The monsters cheered and&#160;<br/>howled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth stepped away from&#160;the window. Her face was ashen.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come on,&#34; I told her, trying to sound braver than&#160;I felt. &#34;The sooner we find Luke the better.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>At the end of the hallway were double oak doors&#160;that looked like they must lead somewhere&#160;<br/>important. When we were thirty feet&#160;away, Tyson stopped. &#34;Voices inside.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You can hear that far?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson closed his eye like he was concentrating hard. Then his voice changed, becoming a&#160;<br/>husky approximation of Luke's. &#34;—the prophecy&#160;ourselves. The fools won't know which way&#160;<br/>to turn.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before I could react, Tyson's voice changed again, becoming deeper and gruffer, like the&#160;<br/>other guy we'd&#160;heard talking to Luke outside the cafeteria. &#34;You really&#160;think the old horseman&#160;<br/>is gone for good?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson laughed Luke's&#160;laugh. &#34;They can't&#160;trust him.&#160;Not with the skeletons in his closet. The&#160;<br/>poisoning of the tree was the final straw.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth shivered. &#34;Stop that, Tyson! How do you do that?&#160;It's&#160;creepy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson opened his eye and looked puzzled. &#34;Just listening.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=74></a>&#34;Keep going,&#34; I said. &#34;What&#160;else are they saying?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson closed his eye again.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He hissed in the gruff man's voice: &#34;Quiet!&#34; Then Luke's&#160;voice,&#160;whispering: &#34;Are you sure?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes,&#34; Tyson said in the gruff voice. &#34;Right outside.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Too late, I realized what was happening.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I just had time to say, &#34;Run!&#34; when the doors of&#160;the stateroom burst open and there was Luke,&#160;<br/>flanked by two hairy giants armed with javelins, their bronze tips aimed&#160;right at our chests.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well,&#34; Luke said with a crooked smile. &#34;If it isn't my&#160;two favorite cousins. Come&#160;right in.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The stateroom was beautiful, and it was horrible.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The beautiful part: Huge windows curved along&#160;the back wall, looking out over the stern of&#160;<br/>the ship. Green sea and blue sky stretched all the way to the horizon. A Persian rug covered&#160;<br/>the floor. Two plush sofas occupied the middle of the room, with a canopied bed in one&#160;<br/>corner and a mahogany dining table in the other. The table was loaded with food—pizza&#160;<br/>boxes, bottles of soda, and a stack of roast beef sandwiches on&#160;a silver platter.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The horrible part: On a velvet dais at the back&#160;of the room&#160;lay a ten-foot-long golden casket.&#160;<br/>A sarcophagus, engraved with Ancient Greek scenes of cities in flames and heroes dying&#160;<br/>grisly deaths. Despite the sunlight streaming through the windows, the casket made the whole&#160;<br/>room&#160;feel cold.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well,&#34; Luke said, spreading his arms proudly. &#34;A little nicer than Cabin Eleven, huh?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He'd&#160;changed since the last summer. Instead of&#160;Bermuda shorts and a T-shirt, he wore a&#160;<br/>button-down shirt, khaki pants,&#160;and leather loafers. His sandy&#160;hair, which used to be so&#160;<br/>unruly, was now clipped short. He looked like&#160;an evil male model, showing off what the&#160;<br/>fashionable college-age villain was wearing to Harvard this year.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He still had the scar under his eye—a jagged white line from&#160;his battle with a dragon. And&#160;<br/>propped against the sofa was his&#160;magical sword, Backbiter, glinting strangely with its half-<br/>steel, half-Celestial bronze blade that could kill both mortals and monsters.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sit,&#34; he told us. He waved his hand and three dining chairs scooted themselves into the&#160;<br/>center of the room.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>None of us sat.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke's&#160;large friends were still pointing their javelins at us. They looked like twins, but they&#160;<br/>weren't human. They stood about eight feet tall,&#160;for one thing, and wore only blue jeans,&#160;<br/>probably because their enormous chests were&#160;already shag-carpeted with thick brown fur.&#160;<br/>They had claws for fin-gernails, feet like paws. Their noses were snoutlike, and their teeth&#160;<br/>were all pointed canines.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where are my manners?&#34; Luke said smoothly. &#34;These are my&#160;assistants, Agrius and Oreius.&#160;<br/>Perhaps you've heard of them.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=75></a>&#160;<br/>I said nothing. Despite the javelins pointed at&#160;me, it wasn't&#160;the bear twins who scared me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'd imagined meeting Luke again many times since he'd&#160;tried to kill me&#160;last summer. I'd&#160;<br/>pictured myself boldly standing&#160;up to him,&#160;challenging him&#160;to a duel. But now that we were&#160;<br/>face-to-face,&#160;I could barely stop my&#160;hands from&#160;shaking.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You don't know Agrius and Oreius's&#160;story?&#34; Luke asked. &#34;Their mother ... well, it's&#160;sad,&#160;<br/>really. Aphrodite ordered the young woman to fall&#160;in love. She refused and ran to Artemis for&#160;<br/>help. Artemis let her become&#160;one of her maiden huntresses, but Aphrodite got her revenge.&#160;<br/>She bewitched the young woman into falling in&#160;love with a bear. When Artemis found out,&#160;<br/>she abandoned the girl in dis-gust. Typical of the gods, wouldn't you say?&#160;They fight with one&#160;<br/>another and the poor humans get&#160;caught in the middle. The girl's&#160;twin sons here, Agrius and&#160;<br/>Oreius, have no love for Olympus. They like half-bloods well enough, though ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;For lunch,&#34; Agrius growled. His gruff voice was&#160;the one I'd heard talking with Luke earlier.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hehe! Hehe!&#34; His brother Oreius laughed, licking his fur-lined&#160;lips. He kept laughing like he&#160;<br/>was having an asthmatic fit until Luke&#160;and Agrius both stared at him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Shut up, you idiot!&#34; Agrius growled. &#34;Go punish yourself!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Oreius whimpered. He trudged over to the corner of the room, slumped onto a stool, and&#160;<br/>banged his forehead against the dining table, making the silver plates rattle.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke acted like this was perfectly normal behavior. He made&#160;himself comfortable on&#160;the sofa&#160;<br/>and propped his feet up on the coffee table. &#34;Well, Percy, we let you survive another year. I&#160;<br/>hope you appreciated it. How's your mom?&#160;How's school?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You poisoned Thalia's&#160;tree.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke sighed. &#34;Right to the point, eh?&#160;Okay, sure I poi-soned the tree. So what?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How could you?&#34; Annabeth sounded so angry&#160;I thought she'd explode. &#34;Thalia saved your&#160;<br/>life! Our lives! How could you dishonor her—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I didn't dishonor her!&#34; Luke snapped. &#34;The gods&#160;dis-honored her, Annabeth! If Thalia were&#160;<br/>alive, she'd be on my&#160;side.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Liar!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;If you knew what was coming, you'd&#160;understand—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I understand you want to destroy the camp!&#34; she yelled. &#34;You're a monster!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke shook his head. &#34;The gods have blinded&#160;you. Can't you imagine a world without them,&#160;<br/>Annabeth?&#160;What good is that ancient history you study?&#160;Three&#160;thousand years of baggage!&#160;<br/>The West is rotten to the core. It has to be destroyed. Join me! We&#160;can start the world anew.&#160;<br/>We could use your intelligence, Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Because you have none of your own!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=76></a>His eyes narrowed. &#34;I know you, Annabeth. You deserve better than tagging along on some&#160;<br/>hopeless quest to save the camp. Half-Blood Hill will be&#160;overrun by monsters within the&#160;<br/>month. The heroes who survive will have no choice but to join us&#160;or be hunted to extinction.&#160;<br/>You really want to be on a losing team&#160;... with company like this?&#34; Luke pointed at Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey!&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Traveling with a Cyclops,&#34; Luke chided. &#34;Talk about dishonoring Thalia's&#160;memory! I'm&#160;<br/>surprised at you, Annabeth. You of all people—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stop it!&#34; she shouted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't know what Luke was talking about, but&#160;Annabeth buried her head in her hands like&#160;<br/>she was about to cry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Leave her alone,&#34; I said. &#34;And leave Tyson out this.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke laughed. &#34;Oh, yeah, I heard. Your father claimed him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I must have looked surprised, because Luke&#160;smiled. &#34;Yes, Percy, I know&#160;all about that. And&#160;<br/>about your plan to find the Fleece. What were&#160;those coordinates, again ... 30, 31, 75, 12?&#160;You&#160;<br/>see, I still have friends at&#160;camp who keep me&#160;posted.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Spies, you mean.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He shrugged. &#34;How many insults from your&#160;father can you stand, Percy?&#160;You think he's&#160;<br/>grateful to you?&#160;You think Poseidon cares for you any more&#160;than he cares for this mon-ster?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson clenched his fists and made a rumbling sound down in his throat.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke just chuckled. &#34;The gods are so using you,&#160;Percy. Do you have any idea what's&#160;in store&#160;<br/>for you if you reach your sixteenth birthday?&#160;Has Chiron even&#160;told you the prophecy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to get in Luke's&#160;face and tell him&#160;off,&#160;but as usual, he knew just how to throw me&#160;off&#160;<br/>balance.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sixteenth birthday?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I mean, I knew Chiron had received a prophecy&#160;from&#160;the Oracle many years ago. I knew part&#160;<br/>of it was about me. But, if I reached my sixteenth birthday?&#160;I didn't like the sound of that.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I know what I need to know,&#34; I managed. &#34;Like, who my&#160;enemies are.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Then you're a fool.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson smashed the nearest dining chair to&#160;splinters. &#34;Percy is not a fool!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before I could stop him,&#160;he charged Luke. His fists came down toward Luke's&#160;head—a double&#160;<br/>overhead blow that would've knocked a hole in&#160;titanium—but the bear&#160;twins intercepted.&#160;<br/>They each caught one of Tyson's arms&#160;and stopped him&#160;cold. They pushed him&#160;back and&#160;<br/>Tyson stumbled. He fell to the&#160;carpet so hard the deck shook.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=77></a>&#34;Too bad, Cyclops,&#34; Luke said. &#34;Looks like my&#160;grizzly friends together are more than a match&#160;<br/>for your strength. Maybe I should let them—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Luke,&#34; I cut in. &#34;Listen to me. Your father sent us.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His face turned the color of pepperoni. &#34;Don't—even— mention him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He told us to take this boat.&#160;I thought it was just for a ride, but&#160;he sent us here to find you. He&#160;<br/>told me&#160;he won't give up on you, no matter how angry you are.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Angry?&#34; Luke roared. &#34;Give up on me?&#160;He&#160;abandoned me, Percy! I want Olympus&#160;<br/>destroyed! Every throne crushed to rubble! You tell Hermes it's&#160;going to happen, too. Each&#160;<br/>time a half-blood joins us, the Olympians grow&#160;weaker and we grow stronger. He grows&#160;<br/>stronger.&#34; Luke pointed to the gold sarcophagus.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The box creeped me&#160;out, but I was determined not to show it. &#34;So?&#34; I demanded. &#34;What's so&#160;<br/>special ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then it hit me, what might be inside the sarcophagus. The temperature in&#160;the room&#160;seemed to&#160;<br/>drop twenty degrees. &#34;Whoa, you don't mean—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He is re-forming,&#34; Luke&#160;said. &#34;Little by little, we're calling his life force out of the pit.&#160;With&#160;<br/>every recruit who pledges our cause, another small piece appears—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's disgusting!&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke sneered at her. &#34;Your mother was born from Zeus's&#160;split skull, Annabeth. I wouldn't&#160;<br/>talk. Soon there will be enough of the titan lord&#160;so that we can make&#160;him&#160;whole again. We&#160;<br/>will piece together a new body for him, a work&#160;worthy of the forges of Hephaestus.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're insane,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Join us and you'll be rewarded. We&#160;have powerful friends, sponsors rich enough to buy this&#160;<br/>cruise ship and much more. Percy, your mother will never have&#160;to work again. You can&#160;buy&#160;<br/>her a mansion. You can have power, fame—whatever you want. Annabeth, you can realize&#160;<br/>your dream&#160;of being an architect. You can build a monument to last a thousand years. A&#160;<br/>temple to the lords of&#160;the next age!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go to Tartarus,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke sighed. &#34;A shame.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He picked up something that looked like a&#160;TV remote and pressed a red button. Within&#160;<br/>seconds the door of the stateroom&#160;opened and two uniformed crew members came in, armed&#160;<br/>with nightsticks. They had the same&#160;glassy-eyed&#160;look as the other mortals I'd seen, but I had a&#160;<br/>feeling this wouldn't make them&#160;any less dangerous in a fight.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah, good, security,&#34; Luke said, &#34;I'm&#160;afraid we have some&#160;stowaways.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; they said dreamily.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=78></a>Luke turned to Oreius. &#34;It's time to feed the&#160;Aethiopian drakon. Take&#160;these fools below and&#160;<br/>show them&#160;how it's done.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Oreius grinned stupidly. &#34;Hehe! Hehe!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let me&#160;go, too,&#34; Agrius grumbled. &#34;My&#160;brother is worthless. That Cyclops—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Is no threat,&#34; Luke said. He glanced back at&#160;the golden casket, as if something were&#160;<br/>troubling him. &#34;Agrius, stay here. We&#160;have important matters to discuss.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oreius, don't&#160;fail me. Stay in the hold to&#160;make sure the drakon is properly fed.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Oreius prodded us with his javelin and herded us out of the stateroom, followed by the two&#160;<br/>human security guards.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As I walked down the corridor with Oreius's&#160;javelin poking me&#160;in the back, I thought about&#160;<br/>what Luke had said—that the bear twins together were a match for Tyson's strength. But&#160;<br/>maybe separately ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We&#160;exited the corridor amidships and walked across an open deck lined with lifeboats. I knew&#160;<br/>the ship well enough to realize this would be our last look at&#160;sunlight. Once we got to the&#160;<br/>other side, we'd&#160;take the elevator down&#160;into the hold, and that would be it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked at Tyson and said, &#34;Now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Thank the gods, he understood. He turned and smacked Oreius thirty feet backward into the&#160;<br/>swimming pool, right into the middle&#160;of the zombie tourist family.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah!&#34; the kids yelled in unison. &#34;We&#160;are not having a blast in the pool!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>One of the security guards drew his nightstick, but Annabeth knocked the wind out of him&#160;<br/>with a well-placed kick. The other&#160;guard ran for the nearest alarm&#160;box.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stop him!&#34; Annabeth yelled, but it was too late.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Just before I banged him on head with&#160;a deck chair, he hit the alarm.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Red lights flashed. Sirens wailed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Lifeboat!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We ran for the nearest one.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>By the time we got the cover off, monsters and more security men were swarming the deck,&#160;<br/>pushing aside tourists and waiters&#160;with trays of tropical drinks. A guy in Greek armor drew&#160;<br/>his sword and charged, but slipped in a puddle of piña colada. Laistrygonian archers&#160;<br/>assembled on the deck above us, notching arrows in their enormous bows.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How do you launch this thing?&#34; screamed&#160;Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=79></a>A hellhound leaped at me, but Tyson slammed it aside with a fire extinguisher.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Get in!&#34; I yelled. I uncapped Riptide and slashed the first volley of&#160;arrows out of the air. Any&#160;<br/>second we would be overwhelmed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The lifeboat was hanging over the side of the ship, high above the water.&#160;Annabeth and Tyson&#160;<br/>were having no luck with the release pulley.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I jumped in beside them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hold on!&#34; I yelled, and I cut the ropes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A shower of arrows whistled over our heads as we free-fell toward the ocean.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>TEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WE HITCH A RIDE WITH&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>DEAD CONFEDERATES&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thermos!&#34; I screamed as we hurtled toward the water.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; Annabeth must've thought I'd lost my&#160;mind. She was holding on to the boat straps&#160;<br/>for dear life, her hair flying straight up like a torch.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But Tyson understood. He managed to open my&#160;duffel bag and take out Hermes's&#160;magical&#160;<br/>thermos without losing his&#160;grip on it or the boat.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Arrows and javelins whistled past us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I grabbed the thermos and hoped I was doing the right thing. &#34;Hang on!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I am&#160;hanging on!&#34; Annabeth yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tighter!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hooked my&#160;feet under the boat's inflatable bench, and as Tyson grabbed Annabeth and me&#160;<br/>by the backs of our shirts, I gave&#160;the thermos cap a quarter turn.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Instantly, a white sheet of wind&#160;jetted out of the ther-mos and propelled us sideways, turning&#160;<br/>our downward plummet into a forty-five-degree crash landing.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=80></a>The wind seemed to laugh as it shot from&#160;the thermos, like it was glad to be free. As we hit&#160;<br/>the ocean, we&#160;bumped once, twice, skipping like&#160;a stone, then we were&#160;whizzing along like a&#160;<br/>speed boat, salt spray in our faces and nothing but sea ahead.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I heard a wail of outrage from&#160;the ship behind&#160;us, but we were already out of weapon range.&#160;<br/>The Princess Andromeda faded to the size of a white toy boat in the distance, and then&#160;it was&#160;<br/>gone.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As we raced&#160;over the sea, Annabeth and I tried&#160;to send an Iris-message to Chiron. We&#160;figured&#160;<br/>it was important we let somebody know what Luke was doing, and we didn't know who else&#160;<br/>to trust.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The wind from&#160;the thermos stirred up a nice sea&#160;spray that made a rainbow in the sunlight—<br/>perfect for an Iris-message—but our connection&#160;was still poor. When&#160;Annabeth threw a gold&#160;<br/>drachma&#160;into the mist and prayed for the rainbow goddess to show us Chiron, his face&#160;<br/>appeared all right, but there was some kind of&#160;weird strobe light flashing in the background&#160;<br/>and rock music blaring, like&#160;he was at a dance club.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We told him about sneaking away from camp,&#160;and Luke and the Princess Andromeda and the&#160;<br/>golden box for Kronos's&#160;remains, but between the noise on his end and the rushing wind and&#160;<br/>water on our end, I'm&#160;not sure how much he heard.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; Chiron yelled, &#34;you&#160;have to watch out for—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His voice was drowned out by loud shouting&#160;behind him—a bunch of voices whooping it up&#160;<br/>like Comanche warriors.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Curse my&#160;relatives!&#34; Chiron ducked as a plate flew over his head and shattered somewhere&#160;<br/>out of sight. &#34;Annabeth, you shouldn't have let Percy leave&#160;camp! But if you do get the&#160;<br/>Fleece—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, baby!&#34; somebody behind Chiron yelled. &#34;Woo-hoooooo!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The music got cranked up, subwoofers&#160;so loud it made our boat vibrate.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;—Miami,&#34; Chiron was yelling. &#34;I'll try to keep watch—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Our misty screen smashed apart like someone on the other side had thrown&#160;a bottle at it, and&#160;<br/>Chiron was gone.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>An hour later we spotted&#160;land—a long&#160;stretch of&#160;beach lined with high-rise hotels. The water&#160;<br/>became crowded with fishing boats and tankers.&#160;A coast guard cruiser passed on our starboard&#160;<br/>side, then turned like it wanted a second look. I guess it isn't every day they see a yellow&#160;<br/>lifeboat with no engine going a hundred&#160;knots an hour, manned by three kids.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=81></a>&#34;That's Virginia Beach!&#34; Annabeth said as we&#160;approached the shoreline. &#34;Oh my&#160;gods, how&#160;<br/>did the Princess Andromeda travel&#160;so far overnight?&#160;That's&#160;like—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Five hundred and thirty nautical miles,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She stared at me. &#34;How did you know that?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—I'm&#160;not sure.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth thought for a moment. &#34;Percy, what's&#160;our position?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;36 degrees, 44 minutes north, 76 degrees, 2 minutes west,&#34; I said immediately. Then I shook&#160;<br/>my head. &#34;Whoa. How did I know that?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Because of your dad,&#34; Annabeth guessed. &#34;When&#160;you're at sea, you have&#160;perfect bearings.&#160;<br/>That is so cool.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wasn't&#160;sure about that. I didn't want to be a human GPS unit. But before I could say&#160;<br/>anything, Tyson tapped my shoulder. &#34;Other boat is coming.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked back. The coast guard vessel was definitely on our tail now. Its lights were flashing&#160;<br/>and it was gaining speed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We can't&#160;let them&#160;catch&#160;us,&#34; I said. &#34;They'll ask too many questions.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Keep going&#160;into Chesapeake Bay,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;I know a place we can hide.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't ask what she meant, or how she knew the area so well. I risked loosening the thermos&#160;<br/>cap a little more, and a fresh burst of wind&#160;sent us rocketing around the northern tip of&#160;<br/>Virginia Beach into Chesapeake Bay.&#160;The coast guard boat fell farther and&#160;farther behind. We&#160;<br/>didn't slow down until the shores of&#160;the bay narrowed on either side, and&#160;I realized we'd&#160;<br/>entered the mouth of a river.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I could feel the change from&#160;salt water to fresh&#160;water. Suddenly I was tired and frazzled, like I&#160;<br/>was coming down off a sugar high. I didn't know where I was anymore, or which way to steer&#160;<br/>the boat. It was a good thing&#160;Annabeth was directing me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;There,&#34; she said. &#34;Past that sandbar.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We veered into a swampy area choked with marsh&#160;grass. I beached the lifeboat at the foot of a&#160;<br/>giant cypress.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Vine-covered trees loomed above us. Insects&#160;chirred in the woods. The air was muggy and&#160;<br/>hot, and steam curled off the river. Basically, it wasn't&#160;Manhattan, and I didn't like it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come on,&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;&#34;It's just down the bank.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What is?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just follow.&#34; She grabbed a duffel bag. &#34;And we'd&#160;better cover the boat. We don't&#160;want to&#160;<br/>draw attention.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=82></a>After burying the lifeboat with branches, Tyson and I followed Annabeth along the shore, our&#160;<br/>feet sinking in red mud. A snake slithered past&#160;my shoe and disappeared into the grass.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not a good place,&#34; Tyson said. He swatted the mosqui-toes that were forming a buffet line&#160;<br/>on his arm.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>After another few minutes,&#160;Annabeth said, &#34;Here.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>All I saw was a patch of brambles. Then Annabeth moved aside a woven circle of branches,&#160;<br/>like a door, and I realized&#160;I was looking into a camouflaged shelter.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The inside was big enough for three, even with&#160;Tyson being the third. The walls were woven&#160;<br/>from&#160;plant material, like&#160;a Native American hut, but they looked pretty water-proof. Stacked&#160;<br/>in the corner was everything you could want&#160;for a campout—sleeping bags, blankets, an ice&#160;<br/>chest, and a kerosene lamp. There were demigod provisions, too— bronze javelin tips, a&#160;<br/>quiver full of&#160;arrows, an extra sword,&#160;and a box of ambrosia. The place smelled musty, like it&#160;<br/>had been vacant for a long time.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;A half-blood hideout.&#34; I looked at Annabeth in awe. You made this place?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thalia and I,&#34; she said quietly. &#34;And Luke.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That shouldn't&#160;have bothered me. I mean, I knew Thalia and Luke had taken care of Annabeth&#160;<br/>when she was little. I knew the three&#160;of&#160;them&#160;had been runaways together, hiding from&#160;<br/>monsters, surviving on their own before Grover&#160;found them&#160;and tried to get them&#160;to Half-<br/>Blood Hill. But when-ever Annabeth talked about the time she'd spent with them, I kind of&#160;<br/>felt ... I don't know. Uncomfortable?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No. That's&#160;not the word.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The word was jealous.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;So ...&#34; I said. &#34;You don't think&#160;Luke will look for us here?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She shook her head. &#34;We made a dozen safe houses like this. I doubt Luke even remembers&#160;<br/>where they are. Or cares.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She threw herself down on the blankets and started going through her duffel bag. Her body&#160;<br/>language made it pretty clear she didn't&#160;want to talk.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um,&#160;Tyson?&#34; I said. &#34;Would you mind scouting around outside? Like, look for a wilderness&#160;<br/>convenience store or something?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Convenience store?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, for snacks. Powdered donuts or something. Just don't go too far.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Powdered donuts,&#34; Tyson said earnestly. &#34;I will look for powdered donuts in the wilderness.&#34;&#160;<br/>He headed outside and started calling, &#34;Here, donuts!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Once he was gone, I sat down across from&#160;Annabeth. &#34;Hey, I'm sorry about, you know, seeing&#160;<br/>Luke.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=83></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's not your fault.&#34; She unsheathed her knife&#160;and started cleaning the blade with a rag.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He let us go too easily,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hoped I'd been imagining it, but Annabeth nodded. &#34;I was thinking the same&#160;thing. What we&#160;<br/>overheard him say about a gamble, and 'they'll&#160;take the bait'... I think he was talking about&#160;<br/>us.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Fleece is the bait? Or Grover?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She studied the edge of her knife. &#34;I don't know, Percy. Maybe he wants the Fleece for&#160;<br/>himself. Maybe he's&#160;hoping we'll do the hard work and then he can steal it from&#160;us. I just can't&#160;<br/>believe he would poison the tree.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What did he mean,&#34; I asked, &#34;that Thalia would've been on his side?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's wrong.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You don't sound sure.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth glared at me, and I started to wish&#160;I hadn't&#160;asked her about this while she was&#160;<br/>holding a knife.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, you know who you remind me of most?&#160;Thalia. You guys are so much alike it's scary.&#160;<br/>I mean, either you would've been best friends or you would've strangled each other.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let's&#160;go with 'best friends.'&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thalia got angry with her dad sometimes. So do you. Would you turn against Olympus&#160;<br/>because of that?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at the quiver of arrows in the corner. &#34;No.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Okay, then. Neither would she. Luke's&#160;wrong.&#34; Annabeth stuck her knife&#160;blade into the dirt.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to ask her about the prophecy Luke&#160;had mentioned and what it had to do with my&#160;<br/>sixteenth birth-day. But&#160;I figured she wouldn't tell me. Chiron had made it pretty clear that I&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;allowed to hear&#160;it until the gods decided otherwise.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;So what did Luke mean&#160;about Cyclopes?&#34; I asked. &#34;He said you of all people—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I know what he said. He ... he was talking about the real reason Thalia died.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I waited, not sure what to say.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth drew a shaky breath. &#34;You can never&#160;trust a Cyclops, Percy. Six years ago, on the&#160;<br/>night Grover was lead-ing us&#160;to Half-Blood Hill—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She was interrupted when the door of&#160;the hut creaked open. Tyson crawled in.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Powdered donuts!&#34; he said proudly, holding up a pastry box.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=84></a>&#160;<br/>Annabeth stared at him.&#160;&#34;Where did you get&#160;that?&#160;We're in the middle of the wilderness.&#160;<br/>There's nothing around for—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fifty feet,&#34; Tyson said. &#34;Monster Donut shop—just over the hill!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This is bad,&#34; Annabeth muttered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were crouching behind a tree, staring at&#160;the donut shop in the middle of the woods. It&#160;<br/>looked brand new, with brightly&#160;lit windows, a parking area, and a&#160;little road leading off into&#160;<br/>the forest, but there was nothing&#160;else around, and no cars parked in&#160;the lot. We&#160;could see one&#160;<br/>employee reading a magazine behind&#160;the cash register. That was it. On the store's marquis, in&#160;<br/>huge black letters that even I could read, it said:&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>MONSTER DONUT&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A cartoon ogre was taking a bite out of the O in MONSTER. The place smelled good, like&#160;<br/>fresh-baked chocolate donuts.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This shouldn't&#160;be here,&#34; Annabeth whispered. &#34;It's wrong.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; I asked. &#34;It's a donut shop.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Shhh!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Why are we whispering?&#160;Tyson went in and bought a dozen. Nothing happened to him.&#34; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's a monster.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Aw, c'mon, Annabeth. Monster Donut doesn't&#160;mean monsters! It's&#160;a chain. We've got them&#160;in&#160;<br/>New York.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;A chain,&#34; she agreed. &#34;And don't you think it's&#160;strange that one appeared immediately after&#160;<br/>you told Tyson to get donuts?&#160;Right&#160;here in the middle of the woods?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought about it. It did seem&#160;a little weird, but, I mean, donut shops weren't real high on my&#160;<br/>list of sinister forces.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It could be a nest,&#34; Annabeth explained.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson whimpered. I doubt he understood what Annabeth was saying any&#160;better than I did, but&#160;<br/>her tone was making him nervous. He'd&#160;plowed through half a dozen donuts from&#160;his box and&#160;<br/>was getting powdered sugar all over his face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;A nest for what?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Haven't&#160;you ever wondered how franchise stores&#160;pop up so fast?&#34;&#160;she asked. &#34;One day there's&#160;<br/>nothing and then the next&#160;day—boom, there's a new burger place or&#160;a coffee shop or&#160;<br/>whatever? First a single store,&#160;then two, then four— exact&#160;replicas spreading across the&#160;<br/>country?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=85></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um,&#160;no. Never thought about it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, some&#160;of&#160;the chains multiply so fast because all their locations&#160;are&#160;magically&#160;linked to&#160;<br/>the life force of a monster. Some&#160;children of&#160;Hermes figured out how to do it back in the&#160;<br/>1950s. They breed—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She froze.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; I demanded. &#34;They breed what?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No—sudden—moves,&#34; Annabeth said, like her&#160;life depended on it. &#34;Very slowly, turn&#160;<br/>around.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I heard&#160;it: a scraping&#160;noise, like something large dragging&#160;its belly through the leaves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I turned and saw a rhino-size thing moving through the shadows of the trees. It was hissing,&#160;<br/>its front half writhing in all&#160;different directions. I couldn't&#160;understand what I was seeing at&#160;<br/>first. Then I realized the thing had multiple&#160;necks—at least seven, each topped with a hissing&#160;<br/>reptilian head. Its skin was leathery, and under each neck it wore&#160;a plastic bib that read: I'm&#160;A&#160;<br/>MONSTER DONUT KID!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I took out my&#160;ballpoint pen, but Annabeth locked&#160;eyes with me—a silent warning. Not yet.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I understood. A lot of monsters have terrible eyesight. It was&#160;possible the Hydra might pass us&#160;<br/>by. But if I uncapped my sword now, the bronze glow would certainly get its attention.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We waited.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Hydra was only a few feet away. It seemed&#160;to be sniffing the ground and the trees like it&#160;<br/>was hunting for something. Then I noticed that two of the heads were rip-ping apart a piece of&#160;<br/>yellow canvas—one of our duffel bags. The thing had already been to our campsite. It was&#160;<br/>following our scent.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My heart pounded. I'd seen a stuffed Hydra-head&#160;trophy at camp before, but that did nothing&#160;<br/>to prepare me for the real thing. Each head&#160;was diamond-shaped, like a&#160;rattlesnake's, but the&#160;<br/>mouths were lined with jagged rows of sharklike teeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson was trembling. He stepped back and accidentally snapped a twig. Immediately, all&#160;<br/>seven heads turned toward us and hissed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Scatter!&#34; Annabeth yelled. She dove to the right.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I rolled to the left. One of&#160;the Hydra heads spat an arc of green liquid that shot past my&#160;<br/>shoulder and splashed against an elm. The&#160;trunk smoked and began to&#160;disinte-grate. The&#160;<br/>whole tree toppled straight toward Tyson, who still hadn't moved, petrified by the monster&#160;<br/>that was now right in front of him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I tackled him&#160;with all my&#160;might, knocking him&#160;aside just as the Hydra lunged and&#160;<br/>the tree crashed on top of two of its heads.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=86></a>The Hydra stumbled backward, yanking its heads free then wailing in outrage at the fallen&#160;<br/>tree. All seven heads shot acid, and the&#160;elm&#160;melted into a steaming pool of muck.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Move!&#34; I told Tyson. I ran to one side and&#160;uncapped Riptide, hoping to draw the monster's&#160;<br/>attention.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It worked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The sight of celestial bronze is&#160;hateful to most mon-sters.&#160;As soon as my&#160;glowing blade&#160;<br/>appeared, the Hydra whipped toward&#160;it with all its heads,&#160;hissing and baring its teeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The good news: Tyson was momentarily out of danger. The bad news: I was about to be&#160;<br/>melted into a puddle of goo.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>One of the heads snapped at me&#160;experimentally. Without thinking, I swung my&#160;sword.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Annabeth yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Too late. I sliced the Hydra's head clean off. It&#160;rolled away into&#160;the grass, leaving a flailing&#160;<br/>stump, which immedi-ately stopped bleeding and began to swell like a balloon.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In a matter of&#160;seconds the wounded neck split into two necks,&#160;each of which grew a full-size&#160;<br/>head. Now I was look-ing at an eight-headed Hydra.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy!&#34; Annabeth scolded. &#34;You just opened another Monster Donut shop somewhere!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I dodged a spray of acid.&#160;&#34;I'm&#160;about to die and&#160;you're worried about that?&#160;How do we kill it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fire!&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;We have to have fire!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As soon as she said that, I remembered&#160;the story. The Hydra's&#160;heads would only stop&#160;<br/>multiplying if&#160;we burned the stumps before they regrew. That's&#160;what Heracles had done,&#160;<br/>anyway. But we had no fire.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I backed up toward river. The Hydra followed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth moved in on my left and tried to distract one of the&#160;heads, parrying its teeth with&#160;<br/>her knife, but another head swung sideways&#160;like a club and knocked her into the muck.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No hitting my friends!&#34; Tyson charged in, putting himself between the Hydra and Annabeth.&#160;<br/>As Annabeth got to her feet, Tyson started smashing at the monster heads with his fists so fast&#160;<br/>it reminded me&#160;of the whack-a-mole game&#160;at the arcade. But even Tyson couldn't fend off the&#160;<br/>Hydra forever.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We kept inching backward, dodging acid splashes and deflecting snapping heads without&#160;<br/>cutting them&#160;off, but I knew we were only postponing our deaths. Eventually, we would make&#160;<br/>a mistake and the thing would kill us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I heard a strange sound—a chug-chug-chug that at first I thought was my&#160;heartbeat. It&#160;<br/>was so powerful it made the riverbank shake.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What's that noise?&#34;&#160;Annabeth shouted, keeping her eyes on the Hydra.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=87></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Steam&#160;engine,&#34; Tyson said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; I ducked as the Hydra spat acid over my head.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then from&#160;the river behind us, a familiar female voice shouted: &#34;There! Prepare the thirty-<br/>two-pounder!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't dare look away from&#160;the Hydra, but&#160;if that was who I thought it was behind us, I&#160;<br/>figured we now had enemies on two fronts.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A gravelly male voice said, &#34;They're too close, m'lady!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Damn the heroes!&#34; the girl said. &#34;Full steam&#160;ahead!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Aye, m'lady.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fire at will, Captain!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth understood what was happening a split second before I did. She yelled, &#34;Hit the&#160;<br/>dirt!&#34; and we&#160;dove for the ground as an earth-shattering BOOM echoed from&#160;the river. There&#160;<br/>was a flash of light, a column&#160;of smoke, and the Hydra exploded right in front of us,&#160;<br/>showering us with nasty green slime that vaporized as soon as it hit, the way monster guts&#160;<br/>tend to do.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Gross!&#34; screamed Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Steamship!&#34; yelled Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stood, coughing from&#160;the cloud of gunpowder smoke that was rolling across the banks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chugging toward us down the river was the strangest ship I'd ever seen. It rode low in the&#160;<br/>water like a submarine, its deck plated with iron. In the middle was a trapezoid-shaped&#160;<br/>casemate with slats on each side for cannons.&#160;A flag waved from&#160;the top—a wild boar and&#160;<br/>spear on a bloodred field. Lining the deck were&#160;zombies in gray uniforms—&#160;dead soldiers&#160;<br/>with shimmering faces that only partially covered their skulls, like the ghouls I'd seen&#160;in the&#160;<br/>Underworld guarding Hades's palace.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The ship was an ironclad. A Civil War battle cruiser. I could just make out the name&#160;along the&#160;<br/>prow in moss-covered letters: CSS Birmingham.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And standing next to the smoking cannon that had&#160;almost killed us, wearing full Greek battle&#160;<br/>armor, was Clarisse.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Losers,&#34; she sneered. &#34;But&#160;I suppose I have to rescue you. Come&#160;aboard.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=88></a>ELEVEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>CLARISSE&#160;BLOWS UP&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>EVERYTHING&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You are in so much trouble,&#34; Clarisse said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We'd&#160;just finished a ship tour we didn't want, through dark rooms overcrowded with dead&#160;<br/>sailors. We'd seen the coal bunker, the boilers&#160;and engine, which huffed and groaned like it&#160;<br/>would explode any minute. We'd&#160;seen the pilothouse and the powder magazine and gunnery&#160;<br/>deck (Clarisse's favorite) with two Dahlgren&#160;smoothbore can-nons on the port and starboard&#160;<br/>sides and a Brooke nine-inch rifled gun fore and aft—all specially refitted to fire celestial&#160;<br/>bronze cannon balls.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Everywhere we went, dead Confederate sailors&#160;stared at us, their ghostly bearded faces&#160;<br/>shimmering over their skulls. They approved of&#160;Annabeth because she told them&#160;she was&#160;<br/>from&#160;Virginia. They were interested in me, too, because my&#160;name&#160;was Jackson—like the&#160;<br/>Southern general—but then I ruined it by telling them&#160;I was&#160;from&#160;New York. They all hissed&#160;<br/>and muttered curses about Yankees.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson was terrified of them. All through the tour, he insisted Annabeth&#160;hold his hand, which&#160;<br/>she didn't look too thrilled about.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Finally, we were escorted to&#160;dinner. The CSS Birmingham&#160;captain's quarters were about the&#160;<br/>size of a walk-in closet, but still much bigger&#160;than any other room&#160;on board. The table was set&#160;<br/>with white linen and china. Peanut butter and jelly&#160;sandwiches, potato chips, and Dr Peppers&#160;<br/>were served by skeletal crewmen. I didn't want&#160;to eat anything served by ghosts, but my&#160;<br/>hunger overruled my&#160;fear.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tantalus expelled you for eternity,&#34;&#160;Clarisse told us smugly. &#34;Mr.&#160;D said if any of you show&#160;<br/>your face at camp again, he'll turn you into&#160;squirrels and run you over with his SUV.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Did they give you this ship?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;'Course not. My father did.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ares?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse sneered. &#34;You think your daddy is the only one with sea power?&#160;The spirits on the&#160;<br/>losing side of every war owe a tribute to Ares.&#160;That's&#160;their curse for being&#160;defeated. I prayed&#160;<br/>to my&#160;father for a naval transport and&#160;here it&#160;is. These guys will do anything I tell them. Won't&#160;<br/>you, Captain?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The captain stood behind her looking stiff and angry. His glowing green eyes fixed me&#160;with a&#160;<br/>hungry stare. &#34;If it means an end to this infernal war, ma'am,&#160;peace at last, we'll do anything.&#160;<br/>Destroy anyone.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=89></a>Clarisse smiled. &#34;Destroy anyone. I like that.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson gulped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Clarisse,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;Luke might be after the Fleece, too. We&#160;saw him.&#160;He's&#160;got the&#160;<br/>coordinates and he's&#160;heading south. He has a cruise ship full of monsters—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Good! I'll blow him&#160;out of the water.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You don't understand,&#34; Annabeth said. We&#160;have to combine forces. Let us help you—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Clarisse pounded the table. &#34;This is my&#160;quest, smart girl! Finally&#160;I get to be the hero,&#160;<br/>and you two will not steal my&#160;chance.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where are your cabin mates?&#34; I asked. &#34;You were allowed to take two friends with you,&#160;<br/>weren't you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They didn't ... I let them&#160;stay behind. To protect the camp.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You mean even the people in your own cabin wouldn't help you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Shut up, Prissy! I don't need them! Or you!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Clarisse,&#34; I said, &#34;Tantalus is&#160;using you. He doesn't&#160;care about the camp. He'd&#160;love to see it&#160;<br/>destroyed. He's&#160;setting you up to fail.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No! I don't care what the Oracle—&#34; She stopped her-self.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; I said. &#34;What did the Oracle tell you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nothing.&#34; Clarisse's&#160;ears turned&#160;pink. &#34;All you need to know is&#160;that I'm finishing this quest&#160;<br/>and you're not helping. On the other hand, I can't&#160;let you go ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;So we're prisoners?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Guests. For now.&#34; Clarisse propped her feet&#160;up on the white linen tablecloth and opened&#160;<br/>another Dr Pepper. &#34;Captain, take them below. Assign them&#160;hammocks on the berth deck. If&#160;<br/>they don't mind their manners, show them&#160;how we deal with enemy spies.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The dream&#160;came as soon as I fell asleep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover was sitting at his loom, desperately unraveling his&#160;wedding train, when the boulder&#160;<br/>door rolled aside and the Cyclops bellowed, &#34;Aha!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover yelped. &#34;Dear! I didn't—you were so quiet!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Unraveling!&#34; Polyphemus roared. &#34;So that's&#160;the prob-lem!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, no. I—I wasn't—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=90></a>&#34;Come!&#34; Polyphemus grabbed Grover around the waist and half carried, half dragged him&#160;<br/>through the tunnels of the cave.&#160;Grover struggled to keep&#160;his high heels on his hooves. His&#160;<br/>veil kept tilting on his head,&#160;threatening to come&#160;off.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Cyclops pulled him&#160;into a warehouse-size cavern decorated with sheep junk. There was a&#160;<br/>wool-covered La-Z-Boy recliner&#160;and a wool-covered television&#160;set, crude bookshelves loaded&#160;<br/>with sheep collectibles—coffee mugs shaped like sheep faces, plaster figurines of sheep,&#160;<br/>sheep board games, and picture&#160;books and action figures. The floor&#160;was littered with piles of&#160;<br/>sheep bones, and other bones that didn't&#160;look&#160;exactly like sheep—the bones of satyrs who'd&#160;<br/>come&#160;to the island looking for Pan.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;set Grover down only long enough to&#160;move another huge boulder. Daylight&#160;<br/>streamed into the cave, and Grover whimpered with longing. Fresh air!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Cyclops dragged him outside to a hilltop overlook-ing the most beautiful island I'd ever&#160;<br/>seen.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was shaped kind of like a saddle cut in half by&#160;an ax. There were lush green hills on either&#160;<br/>side and a wide valley in&#160;the middle, split by a deep chasm&#160;that was spanned by a rope&#160;bridge.&#160;<br/>Beautiful streams rolled to the edge of the canyon and dropped off in rainbow-colored&#160;<br/>waterfalls. Parrots fluttered in the trees.&#160;Pink and purple flowers bloomed on the bushes.&#160;<br/>Hundreds of sheep grazed in the meadows, their wool glinting strangely like copper and&#160;<br/>sil-ver coins.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And at the center of the island,&#160;right next to the rope bridge,&#160;was an enormous twisted oak tree&#160;<br/>with something glittering in its lowest bough.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Golden Fleece.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Even in a dream, I could feel its power radiating across the island, making the grass greener,&#160;<br/>the flowers more beau-tiful. I could almost smell the nature magic at work. I could only&#160;<br/>imagine how powerful the scent would be for a satyr.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover whimpered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes,&#34; Polyphemus said proudly. &#34;See over there?&#160;Fleece is the prize of&#160;my collection! Stole&#160;<br/>it from&#160;heroes long ago, and ever since—free food! Satyrs come&#160;from&#160;all over the world, like&#160;<br/>moths to flame. Satyrs good eating! And now—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;scooped up a wicked set of bronze shears.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover yelped, but Polyphemus just picked up the near-est sheep like it was a stuffed animal&#160;<br/>and shaved off its wool. He handed a fluffy mass of it to Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Put that on the spinning wheel!&#34; he said proudly. &#34;Magic. Cannot be unraveled.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh ... well ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Poor Honeypie!&#34; Polyphemus grinned. &#34;Bad weaver. Ha-ha!&#160;Not to worry. That thread&#160;will&#160;<br/>solve problem. Finish wedding train by tomorrow!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Isn't&#160;that ... thoughtful of you!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=91></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hehe.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But—but, dear,&#34; Grover gulped,&#160;&#34;what if someone were to rescue—I mean attack this&#160;<br/>island?&#34; Grover looked straight at me, and I&#160;knew he was asking for my&#160;benefit. &#34;What would&#160;<br/>keep them&#160;from&#160;marching right up here to your cave?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wifey scared! So cute! Not to worry. Polyphemus has state-of-the-art&#160;security system. Have&#160;<br/>to get through my&#160;pets.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Pets?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover looked across the island, but there was&#160;nothing to see except&#160;sheep grazing peacefully&#160;<br/>in the meadows.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And then,&#34; Polyphemus&#160;growled, &#34;they would have to get through me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He pounded his fist against the nearest rock, which cracked and split in half. &#34;Now, come!&#34; he&#160;<br/>shouted. &#34;Back to the cave.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover looked about ready to cry—so close to freedom, but so hopelessly far. Tears welled in&#160;<br/>his eyes as the boulder door rolled shut, sealing him&#160;once again in&#160;the stinky torch-lit&#160;<br/>dankness of the Cyclops's&#160;cave.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I woke to alarm&#160;bells ringing throughout the ship.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The captain's&#160;gravelly voice: &#34;All hands on deck! Find Lady Clarisse! Where is that girl?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then his ghostly face appeared above me. &#34;Get&#160;up, Yankee. Your friends are already above.&#160;<br/>We are approaching the entrance.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The entrance to what?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He gave me&#160;a skeletal smile. &#34;The&#160;Sea of Monsters, of course.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stuffed my&#160;few belongings that had survived&#160;the Hydra into a sailor's&#160;canvas knapsack and&#160;<br/>slung it over my&#160;shoul-der. I had a sneaking suspicion that one way or another I would not be&#160;<br/>spending another night aboard the CSS Birmingham.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was on my&#160;way upstairs when something made me&#160;freeze. A presence nearby—something&#160;<br/>familiar and unpleasant. For no particular reason,&#160;I felt like picking a fight. I wanted to&#160;punch&#160;<br/>a dead Confederate. The last time&#160;I'd felt like that kind of anger ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Instead of going up, I crept to&#160;the edge of the ventila-tion grate and peered down into the&#160;<br/>boiler deck.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=92></a>Clarisse&#160;was&#160;standing right below me, talking to an&#160;image that shimmered in the steam&#160;from&#160;<br/>the boilers—a muscular man in black leather biker clothes, with a military haircut, red-tinted&#160;<br/>sunglasses, and a knife&#160;strapped to his side.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My fists clenched. It was my&#160;least favorite Olympian: Ares, the god of war.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I don't want excuses, little girl!&#34; he growled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Y-yes, father,&#34; Clarisse mumbled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You don't want to see me&#160;mad, do you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, father.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, father,&#34; Ares mimicked. &#34;You're pathetic. I should've let one of my&#160;sons take this quest.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll succeed!&#34; Clarisse promised, her voice trembling. &#34;I'll make you proud.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You'd better,&#34; he warned. &#34;You asked me&#160;for this&#160;quest, girl. If you let that slimeball Jackson&#160;<br/>kid steal it from&#160;you—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But the Oracle said—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I DON'T&#160;CARE WHAT IT SAID!&#34; Ares bellowed with such force that his image&#160;<br/>shimmered. &#34;You will suc-ceed. And if you don't ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He raised his fist. Even though he was only a&#160;figure in the steam, Clarisse flinched.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Do we understand each&#160;other?&#34; Ares growled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The alarm&#160;bells rang again. I heard voices coming&#160;toward me, officers yelling orders to ready&#160;<br/>the cannons.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I crept back from&#160;the ventilation grate and made&#160;my way upstairs to join Annabeth and Tyson&#160;<br/>on the spar deck.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What's wrong?&#34; Annabeth asked me. &#34;Another dream?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded, but I didn't say anything. I didn't know&#160;what to think about what I'd seen&#160;<br/>downstairs. It bothered me&#160;almost as&#160;much as the dream&#160;about Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse&#160;came&#160;up the stairs right after me. I tried not to look at her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She grabbed a pair of binoculars from&#160;a zombie officer and peered&#160;toward the horizon. &#34;At&#160;<br/>last. Captain,&#160;full steam&#160;ahead!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked in the same&#160;direction as she was, but&#160;I couldn't see much. The sky was overcast. The&#160;<br/>air was hazy and humid, like steam&#160;from&#160;an iron. If&#160;I squinted real hard,&#160;I could just make out&#160;<br/>a couple of dark fuzzy splotches in the distance.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=93></a>My nautical senses told me&#160;we were somewhere off the coast of northern Florida, so we'd&#160;<br/>come&#160;a long way overnight, farther than any mortal ship should've been able to travel.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The engine groaned as we increased speed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson muttered nervously, &#34;Too much&#160;strain on the pis-tons. Not meant for deep water.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wasn't&#160;sure how he knew that, but it made me&#160;nervous.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>After a few more minutes, the dark splotches ahead of us came into focus. To the north, a&#160;<br/>huge mass of rock rose out of the sea—an island&#160;with cliffs at least a&#160;hundred feet tall. About&#160;<br/>half a mile south of that, the other patch of&#160;darkness was a storm brewing. The sky and sea&#160;<br/>boiled together in a roaring mass.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hurricane?&#34; Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; Clarisse said. &#34;Charybdis.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth paled. &#34;Are you crazy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Only way into the Sea of Monsters. Straight&#160;between Charybdis and her sister Scylla.&#34;&#160;<br/>Clarisse pointed to the top of the cliffs, and&#160;I got the feeling something lived up there that I&#160;<br/>did not want to meet.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you mean the only way?&#34; I asked. &#34;The&#160;sea is wide open! Just sail around them.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse rolled her eyes. &#34;Don't you know anything?&#160;If I tried to sail&#160;around them, they would&#160;<br/>just appear in my&#160;path again. If you want to&#160;get into the Sea of Monsters, you have to sail&#160;<br/>through them.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What about the Clashing Rocks?&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;That's another gateway. Jason used it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I can't&#160;blow&#160;apart rocks with my&#160;cannons,&#34; Clarisse said. &#34;Monsters, on the other hand ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You are crazy,&#34; Annabeth decided.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Watch and learn, Wise Girl.&#34; Clarisse turned&#160;to the captain. &#34;Set&#160;course for Charybdis!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Aye, m'lady.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The engine groaned, the iron plating rattled, and the ship began to pick up speed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Clarisse,&#34; I said, &#34;Charybdis sucks&#160;up the sea. Isn't that the story?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And spits it back out again, yeah.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What about Scylla?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;She lives&#160;in&#160;a cave, up on&#160;those cliffs. If&#160;we get too close, her&#160;snaky heads&#160;will come&#160;down&#160;<br/>and start plucking sailors off the ship.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Choose Scylla then,&#34; I said. &#34;Everybody goes below deck and we chug right past.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=94></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Clarisse insisted. &#34;If Scylla doesn't&#160;get her easy meat, she might pick up the whole ship.&#160;<br/>Besides, she's too high to make a good target. My cannons can't shoot straight up. Charybdis&#160;<br/>just sits there at the center of&#160;her whirlwind. We're going to steam&#160;straight toward her, train&#160;<br/>our guns on her, and blow her to Tartarus!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She said it with such relish I&#160;almost wanted to believe her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The engine hummed. The boilers were heating up so much I could feel the deck getting warm&#160;<br/>beneath my&#160;feet. The smokestacks billowed.&#160;The red Ares flag whipped in the wind.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As we got closer to the monsters, the sound of Charybdis got louder and louder—a horrible&#160;<br/>wet roar like the galaxy's biggest&#160;toilet being flushed. Every time&#160;Charybdis inhaled, the ship&#160;<br/>shuddered and lurched forward. Every time she&#160;exhaled, we rose in the water and were&#160;<br/>buf-feted by ten-foot waves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to time the whirlpool. As&#160;near as I could figure, it&#160;took Charybdis about three minutes&#160;<br/>to suck up and destroy everything within a half-mile radius. To avoid her, we would have to&#160;<br/>skirt right next to Scylla's&#160;cliffs. And as bad as Scylla might be, those cliffs were looking&#160;<br/>awfully good to me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Undead sailors calmly went about their business on the spar deck. I guess they'd&#160;fought a&#160;<br/>losing cause before, so this didn't bother them. Or maybe they didn't care about getting&#160;<br/>destroyed because they were already deceased.&#160;Neither thought made me feel any better.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth stood next to me, gripping the rail.&#160;&#34;You still have your thermos full of wind?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded. &#34;But it's too dangerous to use with&#160;a whirl-pool like that.&#160;More wind&#160;might just&#160;<br/>make things worse.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What about controlling the water?&#34; she asked. &#34;You're Poseidon's son. You've done it&#160;<br/>before.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She was right. I closed my eyes and tried to calm the sea, but I couldn't concentrate.&#160;<br/>Charybdis was too loud and powerful. The waves wouldn't respond.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—I can't,&#34; I said miserably.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We need a backup plan,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;This isn't going to work.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth is right,&#34; Tyson said. &#34;Engine's no good.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; she asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Pressure. Pistons need fixing.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before he could explain, the cosmic toilet flushed with a mighty roaaar! The ship lurched&#160;<br/>forward and I was thrown&#160;to the&#160;deck. We&#160;were in the whirlpool.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Full reverse!&#34; Clarisse screamed above the&#160;noise. The sea churned around us, waves crashing&#160;<br/>over the deck. The iron plating was now so hot it&#160;steamed. &#34;Get us within fir-ing range! Make&#160;<br/>ready starboard cannons!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=95></a>&#160;<br/>Dead Confederates rushed back and forth. The pro-peller grinded into reverse, trying to slow&#160;<br/>the ship, but we kept sliding&#160;toward the center of the vortex.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A zombie sailor burst out of the hold and ran to Clarisse. His&#160;gray uniform was smoking. His&#160;<br/>beard was on fire. &#34;Boiler room&#160;overheating, ma'am!&#160;She's going to blow!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well, get down there and fix it!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Can't!&#34; the sailor yelled. &#34;We're vaporizing in the heat.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse pounded the side of the casemate. &#34;All&#160;I need is a few more&#160;minutes! Just enough to&#160;<br/>get in range!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We're going in too fast,&#34; the captain said&#160;grimly. &#34;Prepare yourself for death.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Tyson bellowed. &#34;I can fix it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse looked at him&#160;incredulously. &#34;You?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's a Cyclops,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;He's immune to&#160;fire. And he knows mechanics.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go!&#34; yelled Clarisse.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson, no!&#34; I grabbed his arm.&#160;&#34;It's too dangerous!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He patted my&#160;hand. &#34;Only way, brother.&#34; His expres-sion was determined—confident, even.&#160;<br/>I'd never seen him&#160;look like this before. &#34;I will fix it. Be right back.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As I watched him&#160;follow the smoldering sailor down the hatch, I had a terrible feeling. I&#160;<br/>wanted to run after him,&#160;but the ship&#160;lurched again—and then I saw Charybdis.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She appeared only a few hundred yards away, through a swirl of mist and smoke and water.&#160;<br/>The first thing I noticed was the&#160;reef—a black crag of&#160;coral with a fig tree clinging to the top,&#160;<br/>an oddly peaceful thing in the middle of a mael-strom. All around it,&#160;water curved into a&#160;<br/>funnel, like light around a black hole. Then I saw&#160;the horrible thing anchored to the reef just&#160;<br/>below the waterline—an&#160;enormous mouth with slimy lips&#160;and mossy teeth the size of&#160;<br/>rowboats. And worse, the teeth had braces, bands&#160;of corroded&#160;scummy metal with pieces of&#160;<br/>fish and driftwood and floating garbage stuck between them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Charybdis was an orthodontist's nightmare. She was nothing but a huge black maw with bad&#160;<br/>teeth alignment and a serious overbite, and she'd done nothing for centuries but eat without&#160;<br/>brushing after meals. As I watched, the entire sea around her was sucked into the void—<br/>sharks, schools of fish, a giant squid. And&#160;I realized that in a few seconds, the CSS&#160;<br/>Birmingham would be next.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Lady Clarisse,&#34; the captain&#160;shouted. &#34;Starboard and forward guns are in range!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fire!&#34; Clarisse ordered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=96></a>Three rounds were blasted into&#160;the monster's maw. One blew off the edge of an incisor.&#160;<br/>Another disappeared into her gullet. The third&#160;hit one of Charybdis's retaining bands and shot&#160;<br/>back at us, snapping the Ares flag off its pole.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Again!&#34; Clarisse ordered. The gunners reloaded, but I knew it was hopeless. We&#160;would have&#160;<br/>to pound the monster a hundred more times to do any real damage, and we didn't have that&#160;<br/>long. We&#160;were being sucked in too fast.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then the vibrations in the deck changed. The hum&#160;of the engine got stronger and steadier. The&#160;<br/>ship shuddered and we started pulling away from&#160;the mouth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson did it!&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wait!&#34; Clarisse said. &#34;We need to stay close!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We'll die!&#34; I said. &#34;We have to move away.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I gripped the rail as the ship fought against the suction. The broken Ares flag raced past us&#160;<br/>and lodged in Charybdis's braces. We&#160;weren't making much progress, but at least we were&#160;<br/>holding our own. Tyson had somehow given us just enough juice to keep the ship from being&#160;<br/>sucked in.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Suddenly, the mouth snapped shut. The sea died to absolute calm. Water washed over&#160;<br/>Charybdis.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then, just as quickly as it had closed, the&#160;mouth exploded open, spitting out a wall of water,&#160;<br/>ejecting every-thing inedible, including our cannonballs, one of which slammed into the side&#160;<br/>of the CSS Birmingham with a ding&#160;like the bell on a carnival game.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were thrown backward on a wave that must've been forty feet high. I used all of my&#160;<br/>willpower to keep the ship from&#160;capsizing, but we were still spinning out of control, hurtling&#160;<br/>toward the cliffs on the opposite side of the strait.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Another smoldering sailor burst out of the hold.&#160;He stumbled into Clarisse, almost knocking&#160;<br/>them&#160;both over-board. &#34;The engine is about to blow!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where's&#160;Tyson?&#34; I demanded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Still down there,&#34; the sailor said. &#34;Holding&#160;it together somehow, though I don't know for&#160;<br/>how much longer.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The captain said, &#34;We have to abandon ship.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Clarisse yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We have no choice, m'lady. The hull is already crack-ing apart! She can't—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He never finished his sentence. Quick as lightning, something brown and green shot from the&#160;<br/>sky, snatched up the captain, and lifted him&#160;away.&#160;All that was left were his leather boots.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=97></a>&#34;Scylla!&#34; a sailor yelled, as another column&#160;of reptilian flesh shot from&#160;the cliffs and snapped&#160;<br/>him&#160;up. It happened so fast it was like watching a&#160;laser beam&#160;rather than&#160;a mon-ster. I couldn't&#160;<br/>even make out the thing's face, just a flash of teeth and scales.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I uncapped Riptide and tried to swipe at the monster as it carried off another deckhand, but I&#160;<br/>was way too slow.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Everyone get below!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We can't!&#34; Clarisse drew her own sword. &#34;Below deck is in flames.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Lifeboats!&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Quick!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They'll never get clear of the cliffs,&#34;&#160;Clarisse said. &#34;We'll all be eaten.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We have to try. Percy, the thermos.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I can't&#160;leave Tyson!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We have to get the boats ready!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse took Annabeth's command. She and a few of her undead sailors uncovered one of the&#160;<br/>two emergency rowboats while Scylla's&#160;heads rained from&#160;the sky like a meteor shower with&#160;<br/>teeth, picking off Confederate&#160;sailors one after another.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Get the other boat.&#34; I threw Annabeth the thermos. &#34;I'll get Tyson.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You can't!&#34;&#160;she said. &#34;The heat will kill you!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't listen. I ran for the boiler room hatch,&#160;when suddenly my feet weren't touching the&#160;<br/>deck anymore. I was flying straight up, the wind whistling in my ears,&#160;the side of the cliff&#160;<br/>only inches&#160;from&#160;my&#160;face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Scylla had somehow caught me&#160;by the knapsack, and was lifting me&#160;up toward her lair.&#160;<br/>Without thinking, I swung my&#160;sword behind me&#160;and managed to jab the thing in her beady&#160;<br/>yellow eye. She grunted and dropped me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The fall would've been bad enough, considering I was a hundred feet in the&#160;air. But as I fell,&#160;<br/>the CSS Birmingham&#160;exploded below me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>KAROOM!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The engine room&#160;blew, sending chunks of ironclad&#160;fly-ing in either direction like a fiery set of&#160;<br/>wings.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The lifeboats had managed to get away from&#160;the ship, but not very far. Flaming wreckage was&#160;<br/>raining down. Clarisse and Annabeth would either be smashed or burned or pulled to the&#160;<br/>bottom&#160;by the force of the sinking hull, and that&#160;was thinking&#160;optimistically, assuming they&#160;<br/>got away from Scylla.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=98></a>Then I heard a different kind of explosion—the sound of Hermes's&#160;magic&#160;thermos being&#160;<br/>opened a little too far. White sheets of wind blasted in every direction,&#160;scattering the lifeboats,&#160;<br/>lifting me&#160;out of my&#160;free&#160;fall and propelling me&#160;across the ocean.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't see anything. I spun in the air, got&#160;clonked on the head by something hard, and hit&#160;<br/>the water with a crash that would've broken every bone in my body if I hadn't been the son of&#160;<br/>the Sea God.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The last thing I remembered was sinking in&#160;a burning sea, knowing that Tyson was gone&#160;<br/>forever, and wishing I were able to drown.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>TWELVE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WE CHECK IN TO&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>C.C.'S SPA &amp; RESORT&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I woke up in a rowboat with a makeshift sail stitched of gray&#160;uniform&#160;fabric. Annabeth sat&#160;<br/>next to me, tacking into the wind.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to sit up and immediately felt woozy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Rest,&#34; she said. &#34;You're going to need it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson ... ?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She shook her head. &#34;Percy, I'm&#160;really sorry.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were silent while the waves tossed us up and down.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He may have survived,&#34;&#160;she said halfheartedly. &#34;I mean, fire can't&#160;kill him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded, but I had no reason to feel hopeful. I'd&#160;seen that explosion rip through solid iron. If&#160;<br/>Tyson had been down in the boiler room, there was no way he could've lived.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He'd&#160;given his life for us, and all I could think about were the times I'd felt embarrassed by&#160;<br/>him&#160;and had denied that the two of us were related.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Waves lapped at the boat. Annabeth showed me&#160;some&#160;things she'd salvaged from&#160;the&#160;<br/>wreckage—Hermes's&#160;ther-mos (now empty), a&#160;Ziploc bag full of ambrosia, a couple of&#160;<br/>sailors'&#160;shirts, and a bottle of Dr Pepper. She'd fished me&#160;out of the water and found my&#160;<br/>knapsack, bitten in half by Scylla's&#160;teeth. Most&#160;of my stuff had floated away, but I still had&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=99></a>Hermes's&#160;bottle of multivitamins, and of course I had Riptide. The ballpoint pen always&#160;<br/>appeared back in my&#160;pocket no matter where I lost it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We sailed for hours. Now that we were in the&#160;Sea of Monsters, the water glittered a more&#160;<br/>brilliant green, like Hydra acid. The wind smelled fresh and salty, but it carried a strange&#160;<br/>metallic scent, too—as if a thunderstorm&#160;were&#160;coming. Or something even more dangerous. I&#160;<br/>knew what direction we needed to go. I knew we&#160;were exactly one hundred thirteen nautical&#160;<br/>miles west by northwest of our destination. But that didn't make me&#160;feel any less lost.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No matter which way we turned, the sun seemed to&#160;shine straight into my&#160;eyes. We&#160;took turns&#160;<br/>sipping from the Dr Pepper, shading ourselves with&#160;the sail as best we could. And we talked&#160;<br/>about my&#160;latest dream&#160;of Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>By Annabeth's&#160;estimate, we had less than&#160;twenty-four hours to find Grover, assuming my&#160;<br/>dream&#160;was accurate, and assuming the Cyclops Polyphemus didn't change his mind and try to&#160;<br/>marry Grover earlier.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said bitterly. &#34;You can never trust a Cyclops.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth stared across the water. &#34;I'm&#160;sorry, Percy. I was wrong about Tyson, okay?&#160;I wish I&#160;<br/>could tell him that.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to stay mad at her, but it wasn't&#160;easy. We'd&#160;been through a lot together. She'd saved my&#160;<br/>life plenty of&#160;times. It was stupid of me&#160;to resent her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked down at our measly possessions—the empty wind thermos, the bottle of&#160;<br/>multivitamins. I thought about Luke's&#160;look of rage&#160;when I'd tried to talk to&#160;him&#160;about his dad.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth, what's&#160;Chiron's prophecy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She pursed her lips. &#34;Percy, I shouldn't—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I know Chiron promised the gods he wouldn't tell me. But you didn't promise, did you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Knowledge isn't always good for you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Your mom is the wisdom goddess!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I know! But every time heroes learn the future,&#160;they try to change it,&#160;and it never works.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The gods are worried about something I'll do when I get older,&#34; I guessed. &#34;Something when&#160;<br/>I turn sixteen.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth twisted her Yankees cap in her hands. &#34;Percy, I don't know the full prophecy, but it&#160;<br/>warns about a half-blood child of the Big Three—the next one who lives to the age of sixteen.&#160;<br/>That's&#160;the real reason Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades swore a pact after World War II not to have&#160;<br/>any more kids. The next child of the Big Three who reaches sixteen will be&#160;a dangerous&#160;<br/>weapon.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Why?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=100></a>&#34;Because that hero will decide the fate of Olympus. He or she will make a decision that either&#160;<br/>saves the Age of the Gods, or destroys it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I let that sink&#160;in. I don't get seasick, but suddenly I felt ill. &#34;That's why Kronos didn't&#160;kill me&#160;<br/>last summer.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She nodded. &#34;You could be very useful to him.&#160;If&#160;he can get you on his side, the gods will be&#160;<br/>in serious trouble.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But if it's me in the prophecy—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We'll only know that if you survive three more&#160;years. That can be a long time&#160;for a half-<br/>blood. When&#160;Chiron first learned about Thalia, he&#160;assumed she was the one in the prophecy.&#160;<br/>That's&#160;why he was so desperate to get her safely to camp. Then&#160;she went down fighting and&#160;<br/>got turned into a pine tree and none of&#160;us knew what to think. Until you came&#160;along.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>On our port side, a spiky green&#160;dorsal fin about fifteen feet long curled out of the water and&#160;<br/>disappeared.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This kid in the prophecy ... he or she couldn't&#160;be like, a Cyclops?&#34; I asked. &#34;The Big Three&#160;<br/>have lots of monster children.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth shook her head. &#34;The Oracle said 'half-blood.'&#160;That always means half-human, half-<br/>god. There's really nobody alive&#160;who it could be, except you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Then why do the gods even let me&#160;live?&#160;It would be safer to&#160;kill me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're right.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thanks a lot.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, I don't know. I guess some&#160;of the gods&#160;would like to kill you, but they're probably&#160;<br/>afraid of offending Poseidon. Other gods ... maybe they're still watching you, trying to decide&#160;<br/>what kind of hero you're going be. You could be&#160;a weapon for their survival, after all. The&#160;<br/>real ques-tion is ... what will you do in three years?&#160;What decision will you make?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Did the prophecy give any hints?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth hesitated.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Maybe she would've told me&#160;more, but just&#160;then a sea-gull swooped down out of nowhere and&#160;<br/>landed on our makeshift mast. Annabeth looked startled as the bird dropped&#160;a small cluster of&#160;<br/>leaves into her lap.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Land,&#34; she said. &#34;There's&#160;land nearby!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I sat up. Sure enough, there was a line of blue and brown in the distance. Another minute and&#160;<br/>I could make out an island with a small mountain in the center, a dazzling white collection of&#160;<br/>buildings,&#160;a beach dotted&#160;with palm&#160;trees, and a&#160;harbor filled with a strange assortment of&#160;<br/>boats.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The current was pulling our rowboat toward&#160;what looked like a&#160;tropical paradise.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=101></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Welcome!&#34; said the lady with the clipboard.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She looked like a flight attendant—blue business suit, perfect makeup, hair pulled back in a&#160;<br/>ponytail. She shook our hands as we stepped onto&#160;the dock. With the dazzling smile she gave&#160;<br/>us, you would've thought we'd&#160;just gotten off&#160;the Princess Andromeda rather than a banged-<br/>up rowboat.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then again, our rowboat wasn't&#160;the weirdest ship in port. Along with a bunch of pleasure&#160;<br/>yachts, there was a U.S. Navy submarine, several dugout canoes, and an old-fashioned three-<br/>masted sailing ship. There was a helipad with a&#160;&#34;Channel Five Fort Lauderdale&#34; helicopter on&#160;<br/>it, and a short runway with a&#160;Learjet and a propeller plane&#160;that looked like a World War II&#160;<br/>fighter. Maybe they were replicas for tourists to look&#160;at or something.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Is this your first time&#160;with us?&#34; the clipboard lady inquired.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and I exchanged looks. Annabeth said, &#34;Umm&#160;...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;First—time—at—spa,&#34; the lady said as she wrote on her clipboard. &#34;Let's&#160;see ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She looked us up and down critically. &#34;Mmm. An&#160;herbal wrap to start for the young lady. And&#160;<br/>of course, a complete makeover for the young gentleman.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;A what?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She was too busy jotting down notes to answer.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Right!&#34; She said with a&#160;breezy smile. &#34;Well, I'm sure C.C. will want&#160;to speak with you&#160;<br/>personally before the luau. Come, please.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now here's&#160;the thing. Annabeth and I were used&#160;to traps, and usually those traps looked good&#160;<br/>at first. So I expected the clipboard lady to turn into a snake or a demon, or&#160;something, any&#160;<br/>minute. But on the other hand, we'd&#160;been floating&#160;in a rowboat for most of the day. I was hot,&#160;<br/>tired, and hungry, and when this lady mentioned&#160;a luau, my&#160;stom-ach sat up on its hind legs&#160;<br/>and begged like a dog.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I guess it couldn't hurt,&#34; Annabeth muttered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Of course it could, but we&#160;followed the lady anyway. I kept my hands in my&#160;pockets where I'd&#160;<br/>stashed my&#160;only magic defenses—Hermes's multivitamins and Riptide—&#160;but the farther we&#160;<br/>wandered into the resort, the more I for-got about them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The place was amazing. There was white marble and blue water everywhere I looked.&#160;<br/>Terraces climbed up the side of the mountain, with swimming&#160;pools on every level,&#160;<br/>con-nected by watersides and waterfalls&#160;and underwater tubes you&#160;could swim&#160;through.&#160;<br/>Fountains sprayed water into&#160;the air, forming impossible shapes, like flying eagles and&#160;<br/>gallop-ing horses.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson loved horses, and I knew he'd&#160;love those fountains. I almost turned around to see the&#160;<br/>expression on&#160;his face before I remembered: Tyson was gone.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You okay?&#34; Annabeth asked me. &#34;You look pale.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=102></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;okay,&#34; I lied. &#34;Just ... let's keep walking.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We passed all kinds of tame&#160;animals. A sea&#160;turtle napped in a stack of beach towels. A&#160;<br/>leopard stretched out asleep on the diving&#160;board. The resort guests—only young women, as&#160;<br/>far as I could see—lounged in deck chairs, drink-ing fruit smoothies or reading magazines&#160;<br/>while herbal gunk dried on their&#160;faces and manicurists in white uniforms did their nails.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As we headed up a staircase toward what&#160;looked like the main building, I heard a woman&#160;<br/>singing. Her voice drifted through&#160;the air like a lullaby. Her words were in some&#160;lan-guage&#160;<br/>other than Ancient Greek, but&#160;just as old—Minoan, maybe, or&#160;something like that. I could&#160;<br/>understand what she sang about—moonlight in the&#160;olive groves, the colors of the sunrise.&#160;<br/>And magic. Something about magic. Her voice seemed to lift me&#160;off the steps and carry me&#160;<br/>toward her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We came&#160;into a big room&#160;where the whole front wall was windows. The back wall was&#160;<br/>covered in mirrors, so the room&#160;seemed to go&#160;on forever. There was a bunch of expensive-<br/>looking white furniture, and on a table in one corner was a large wire pet cage. The cage&#160;<br/>seemed out of place, but I didn't think about it too much, because just then I saw the lady&#160;<br/>who'd been singing ... and whoa.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She sat at a loom&#160;the size of a big screen&#160;TV, her hands weaving colored thread back and&#160;<br/>forth with amazing skill. The tapestry shimmered like it was three dimensional—a waterfall&#160;<br/>scene so real I could see the water moving and clouds drifting across a fabric sky.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth caught her breath. &#34;It's beautiful.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The woman turned. She was even prettier than&#160;her fab-ric. Her long dark hair was braided&#160;<br/>with threads of gold. She had piercing green&#160;eyes and she wore a silky black dress with&#160;<br/>shapes that seemed to move in the fabric: animal shadows, black upon black, like deer&#160;<br/>running through a forest at night.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You appreciate weaving, my&#160;dear?&#34;&#160;the woman asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, yes, ma'am!&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;My mother is—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She stopped herself. You couldn't just go around announcing that your mom was Athena, the&#160;<br/>goddess who invented the loom. Most people would lock you in a rubber room.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Our hostess just smiled. &#34;You have good taste, my&#160;dear. I'm&#160;so&#160;glad you've come. My name&#160;is&#160;<br/>C.C.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The animals in the corner cage started squealing. They must've been guinea pigs, from&#160;the&#160;<br/>sound of them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We introduced ourselves to C.C. She looked me&#160;over with a twinge of&#160;disapproval, as if I'd&#160;<br/>failed some&#160;kind of test. Immediately, I felt bad.&#160;For some&#160;reason, I really wanted to please&#160;<br/>this lady.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, dear,&#34; she sighed. &#34;You do need my&#160;help.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ma'am?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=103></a>&#160;<br/>C.C. called to the lady in&#160;the business&#160;suit. &#34;Hylla,&#160;take Annabeth on a tour, will you? Show&#160;<br/>her what we have avail-able. The clothing will need to change. And the hair, my&#160;goodness.&#160;<br/>We will do a full image consultation&#160;after I've spoken with this young gentleman.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But ...&#34; Annabeth's&#160;voice sounded hurt. &#34;What's wrong with my&#160;hair?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>C.C. smiled benevolently. &#34;My dear, you are lovely. Really! But you're not showing off&#160;<br/>yourself or your talents at all. So much&#160;wasted potential!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wasted?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well, surely you're not happy the way you are!&#160;My goodness, there's not a single person who&#160;<br/>is. But don't worry. We&#160;can improve anyone here at the spa. Hylla will show you what I&#160;<br/>mean. You, my dear, need to&#160;unlock your true self!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth's&#160;eyes glowed with longing. I'd never&#160;seen her so much at a loss for words. &#34;But ...&#160;<br/>what about Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, definitely,&#34; C.C. said, giving me&#160;a sad look. &#34;Percy requires my&#160;personal attention. He&#160;<br/>needs much more work than you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Normally if somebody had told me&#160;that, I would've gotten angry, but when C.C. said it, I felt&#160;<br/>sad. I'd disap-pointed her. I had&#160;to figure out how to do better.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The guinea pigs squealed&#160;like they were hungry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well ...&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;I suppose ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Right this way, dear,&#34; Hylla&#160;said. And Annabeth allowed herself&#160;to be&#160;led away into&#160;the&#160;<br/>waterfall-laced gardens of&#160;the spa.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>C.C. took my arm&#160;and guided me&#160;toward the&#160;mirrored wall. &#34;You see, Percy ... to unlock your&#160;<br/>potential, you'll need serious help. The first&#160;step is&#160;admitting that you're not happy the way&#160;<br/>you are.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I fidgeted in the front of the mirror. I hated&#160;thinking about my&#160;appearance—like the first zit&#160;<br/>that had cropped up on my nose at the beginning&#160;of the school year, or the fact that my two&#160;<br/>front teeth weren't perfectly even, or that my&#160;hair never stayed down straight.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>C.C.'s&#160;voice brought all of these things to&#160;mind, as if she were passing me&#160;under a&#160;<br/>microscope. And my&#160;clothes were not cool. I knew that.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Who cares?&#160;Part of me&#160;thought. But standing in front of C.C.'s&#160;mirror, it was hard to see&#160;<br/>anything good in myself.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;There, there,&#34; C.C. consoled. &#34;How about we try ... this.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She snapped her fingers and a sky-blue curtain&#160;rolled down over the mirror. It shimmered like&#160;<br/>the fabric on her loom.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you see?&#34; C.C. asked.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=104></a>&#160;<br/>I looked at the blue cloth, not sure what she meant. &#34;I don't—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then it changed colors. I saw myself—a reflection, but not a reflection. Shimmering there on&#160;<br/>the cloth was a cooler version of Percy Jackson—with just the&#160;right clothes, a confident smile&#160;<br/>on my&#160;face. My teeth were straight. No zits.&#160;A perfect tan. More athletic. Maybe a couple of&#160;<br/>inches taller. It was me, without the faults.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Whoa,&#34; I managed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Do you want that?&#34;&#160;C.C. asked.&#160;&#34;Or shall I try a different—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; I said. &#34;That's ... that's&#160;amazing. Can you really—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I can give you a full makeover,&#34; C.C. promised.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What's the catch?&#34; I said. &#34;I have&#160;to like ... eat a special diet?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, it's quite easy,&#34; C.C. said. &#34;Plenty of fresh fruit, a mild exercise program,&#160;and of course&#160;<br/>... this.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She stepped over to her wet bar and filled a glass&#160;with water. Then she ripped open a drink-<br/>mix packet and poured in some&#160;red powder. The mixture began to glow. When it faded, the&#160;<br/>drink looked just like a&#160;strawberry milk shake.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;One of these, substituted for a regular meal,&#34; C.C. said. &#34;I guarantee you'll see results&#160;<br/>immediately.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How is that possible?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She laughed. &#34;Why question it?&#160;I mean, don't you want the perfect you right away?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Something nagged at the back of my&#160;mind.&#160;&#34;Why are there no guys at this spa?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, but there are,&#34; C.C. assured me. &#34;You'll meet them&#160;quite soon. Just try the mixture.&#160;<br/>You'll see.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked at the blue tapestry, at&#160;the reflection of me, but not me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Now, Percy,&#34; C.C. chided. &#34;The hardest part&#160;of the makeover process&#160;is giving up control.&#160;<br/>You have to decide: do you want to trust your judgment about what you should be, or my&#160;<br/>judgment?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My throat felt dry. I heard myself say, &#34;Your judgment.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>C.C. smiled and handed me&#160;the glass. I lifted it to&#160;my&#160;lips.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It tasted just like it looked—like a strawberry&#160;milk shake. Almost immediately a warm feeling&#160;<br/>spread through my&#160;gut: pleasant at first, then painfully hot, searing, as if the mixture were&#160;<br/>coming to a boil inside of me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I doubled over and dropped the cup. &#34;What have you ... what's&#160;happening?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=105></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't worry, Percy,&#34; C.C. said. &#34;The pain&#160;will pass. Look! As I promised. Immediate&#160;<br/>results.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Something was horribly wrong.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The curtain dropped away, and in the mirror I&#160;saw my&#160;hands shriveling, curling, growing long&#160;<br/>delicate claws. Fur sprouted on my&#160;face, under my shirt, in every uncomfort-able place you&#160;<br/>can imagine. My teeth felt too heavy in my&#160;mouth. My clothes were getting too big, or C.C.&#160;<br/>was getting too tall—no, I was shrinking.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In one awful flash, I sank into a cavern of dark&#160;cloth. I was buried in my&#160;own shirt. I tried to&#160;<br/>run but hands grabbed me—hands as&#160;big as I was. I tried to scream&#160;for help, but all that came&#160;<br/>out of my&#160;mouth was,&#160;&#34;Reeet, reeet,&#160;reeet!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The giant hands squeezed me&#160;around the middle,&#160;lift-ing me&#160;into the air. I struggled and&#160;<br/>kicked with legs and arms that seemed much&#160;too stubby, and then I was staring, horrified, into&#160;<br/>the enormous face of C.C.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Perfect!&#34; her voice boomed. I squirmed in alarm, but she only tightened her grip around my&#160;<br/>furry belly. &#34;See, Percy? You've unlocked your true self!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She held me&#160;up to the mirror, and what I saw made me&#160;scream in terror,&#160;&#34;Reeet, reeet, reeet!&#34;&#160;<br/>There was C.C., beau-tiful and smiling, holding a&#160;fluffy, bucktoothed creature with tiny claws&#160;<br/>and white and orange fur. When I twisted, so did the furry critter in the mirror. I was ... I was&#160;<br/>...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;A guinea pig,&#34; C.C. said. &#34;Lovely, aren't&#160;you?&#160;Men are pigs, Percy Jackson. I used to turn&#160;<br/>them&#160;into real pigs, but they were so smelly and large and difficult to keep. Not much&#160;<br/>different than they were before, really. Guinea pigs are much more convenient! Now come,&#160;<br/>and meet the other men.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Reeet!&#34; I protested, trying to scratch&#160;her, but C.C. squeezed me&#160;so tight I almost blacked out.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;None of that, little one,&#34; she scolded, &#34;or I'll&#160;feed you to the owls. Go into the cage like a&#160;<br/>good little pet. Tomorrow, if you behave, you'll be&#160;on your way. There is always a classroom&#160;<br/>in need of a new guinea pig.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My mind was racing as fast as my&#160;tiny little heart.&#160;I needed to&#160;get back to my clothes, which&#160;<br/>were lying in a heap on the floor. If I could do&#160;that, I could get Riptide out of my&#160;pocket and&#160;<br/>... And what?&#160;I couldn't uncap the pen. Even&#160;if I did, I couldn't&#160;hold the sword.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I squirmed helplessly as C.C. brought me&#160;over to the guinea pig cage and opened the wire&#160;<br/>door.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Meet my&#160;discipline problems, Percy,&#34; she warned. &#34;They'll never make good classroom&#160;pets,&#160;<br/>but they might teach you some&#160;manners. Most&#160;of them&#160;have been in this cage for three&#160;<br/>hundred years. If you don't want to stay with them permanently, I'd suggest you—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth's&#160;voice called: &#34;Miss C.C.?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=106></a>C.C. cursed in Ancient Greek. She plopped me&#160;into the cage and closed the door. I squealed&#160;<br/>and clawed at the bars, but it was no good. I watched as C.C. hurriedly kicked my&#160;clothes&#160;<br/>under the loom&#160;just as Annabeth came in.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I almost didn't&#160;recognize her. She was wearing a sleeveless silk dress like C.C.'s, only white.&#160;<br/>Her blond hair was newly washed and combed and braided with gold. Worst of all, she was&#160;<br/>wearing makeup, which I never thought Annabeth would be caught dead in. I mean, she&#160;<br/>looked good. Really good. I probably would've been tongue-tied if&#160;I could've said any-thing&#160;<br/>except reet, reet, reet. But there was also something totally wrong about it. It just wasn't&#160;<br/>Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She looked around the room&#160;and frowned. &#34;Where's&#160;Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I squealed up a storm,&#160;but she didn't seem&#160;to hear me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>C.C. smiled. &#34;He's having one of our treatments, my dear. Not to worry. You look wonderful!&#160;<br/>What did you think of your tour?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth's&#160;eyes brightened. &#34;Your library is amazing!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, indeed,&#34; C.C. said, &#34;The best knowledge&#160;of the past&#160;three millennia. Anything you want&#160;<br/>to study, anything you want to be, my dear.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;An architect?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Pah!&#34; C.C. said. &#34;You, my dear, have the makings of a sorceress. Like me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth took a step back. &#34;A sorceress?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, my&#160;dear.&#34; C.C. held up her hand. A flame appeared in her palm&#160;and danced across her&#160;<br/>fingertips. &#34;My mother is Hecate, the goddess of&#160;magic. I know a daughter of Athena when I&#160;<br/>see one. We&#160;are not so different, you and I.&#160;We&#160;both seek knowledge. We&#160;both admire&#160;<br/>greatness. Neither of us needs to&#160;stand in the shadow of men.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—I don't understand.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Again, I squealed my&#160;best, trying to get Annabeth's&#160;attention, but she either couldn't hear me&#160;<br/>or didn't think the noises were important. Meanwhile, the other guinea pigs were emerging&#160;<br/>from&#160;their hutch to check me&#160;out. I didn't think&#160;it was possible for guinea pigs to look mean,&#160;<br/>but these did. There were half a dozen, with&#160;dirty fur and cracked teeth and beady red eyes.&#160;<br/>They were covered with shavings and smelled like they really had been in here for three&#160;<br/>hun-dred years, without getting their cage cleaned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stay with me,&#34; C.C. was telling Annabeth. &#34;Study with me. You can join our staff, become&#160;a&#160;<br/>sorceress, learn to bend others to your will. You will become&#160;immortal!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You are too intelligent,&#160;my&#160;dear,&#34; C.C. said.&#160;&#34;You know better than to&#160;trust that silly&#160;camp&#160;<br/>for heroes.&#160;How many great female&#160;half-blood heroes can you name?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um,&#160;Atalanta, Amelia Earhart—&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=107></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Bah! Men get all the glory.&#34; C.C. closed her&#160;fist and extinguished the magic flame. &#34;The&#160;<br/>only way to power for women is sorcery. Medea, Calypso, now there were powerful women!&#160;<br/>And me, of course. The greatest of all.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You ... C.C. ... Circe!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, my&#160;dear.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth backed up, and Circe laughed. &#34;You need not worry. I mean you no harm.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What have you done to Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Only helped him&#160;realize his true form.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth scanned the room. Finally she saw the cage, and me scratching at the bars, all the&#160;<br/>other guinea pigs crowding around me. Her eyes went wide.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Forget him,&#34; Circe said. &#34;Join me&#160;and learn the ways of sorcery.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Your friend&#160;will be well cared for. He'll be shipped to a wonderful new home&#160;on the&#160;<br/>mainland. The kindergartners will adore him.&#160;Meanwhile, you will be wise and powerful. You&#160;<br/>will have all you ever wanted.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth was still staring at me, but she had a dreamy expression on her face. She looked the&#160;<br/>same&#160;way I had when Circe enchanted me&#160;into&#160;drinking the guinea pig milk shake. I squealed&#160;<br/>and scratched, trying to warn her to snap out&#160;of it, but I was absolutely powerless.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let me&#160;think about it,&#34; Annabeth murmured. &#34;Just... give me&#160;a minute alone. To say good-<br/>bye.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Of course, my dear,&#34; Circe cooed. &#34;One minute.&#160;Oh ... and so you have absolute privacy ...&#34;&#160;<br/>She waved her hand and iron bars slammed down over the windows. She swept out of the&#160;<br/>room&#160;and I heard the locks on the door click shut behind her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The dreamy look melted off Annabeth's&#160;face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She rushed over to my&#160;cage.&#160;&#34;All right, which one is you?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I squealed, but so did all the&#160;other guinea pigs. Annabeth looked desperate. She scanned the&#160;<br/>room&#160;and spotted the cuff of my jeans sticking out from&#160;under&#160;the loom.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Yes!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She rushed over and rummaged through my&#160;pockets.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But instead of bringing out Riptide, she found&#160;the bottle of Hermes multivitamins and started&#160;<br/>struggling with the cap.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=108></a>I wanted to scream&#160;at her that this wasn't&#160;the time for taking supplements! She had to draw the&#160;<br/>sword!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She popped a lemon chewable in her mouth just&#160;as the door flew open and Circe came back&#160;<br/>in, flanked by two of her business-suited attendants.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well,&#34; Circe sighed, &#34;how fast a minute passes. What is your answer, my dear?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This,&#34; Annabeth said, and&#160;she drew her bronze knife.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The sorceress stepped back, but her surprise quickly passed. She sneered. &#34;Really, little girl, a&#160;<br/>knife against my&#160;magic?&#160;Is that wise?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Circe looked back at her attendants, who smiled. They raised their hands as if preparing to&#160;<br/>cast a spell.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Run! I wanted to tell Annabeth, but all I could make were rodent noises. The other guinea&#160;<br/>pigs squealed in terror and scuttled around the cage. I had the urge to panic and hide, too, but&#160;<br/>I had to think of something! I couldn't stand to lose Annabeth the way I'd lost Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What will Annabeth's&#160;makeover be?&#34; Circe mused. &#34;Something small and ill-tempered. I&#160;<br/>know ... a shrew!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Blue fire coiled from&#160;her fingers&#160;curling like serpents around Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I watched, horror-struck, but nothing happened. Annabeth was still Annabeth, only angrier.&#160;<br/>She leaped for-ward and stuck the point of her knife against Circe's neck. &#34;How about turning&#160;<br/>me&#160;into a panther instead?&#160;One that&#160;has her claws at your throat!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How!&#34; Circe yelped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth held up my&#160;bottle of vitamins for the sorcer-ess to see.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Circe howled in frustration. &#34;Curse Hermes and&#160;his multivitamins! Those are such a fad! They&#160;<br/>do nothing for you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Turn Percy back to a human&#160;or else!&#34; Annabeth said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I can't!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Then you asked for it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Circe's attendants stepped forward, but their mistress said, &#34;Get back! She's immune to magic&#160;<br/>until that cursed vitamin&#160;wears off.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth dragged Circe over to the guinea pig&#160;cage, knocked the top off, and poured the rest&#160;<br/>of the vitamins inside.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Circe screamed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was the first to get a vitamin, but all the other guinea pigs scuttled out, too, and checked out&#160;<br/>this new food.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=109></a>&#160;<br/>The first nibble, and I felt all fiery inside. I gnawed at the vitamin until it stopped looking so&#160;<br/>huge, and the cage got smaller, and then suddenly, bang! The cage exploded. I was sitting on&#160;<br/>the floor, a human again—somehow back in my&#160;regular clothes, thank the gods—with six&#160;<br/>other guys who all looked disoriented, blinking&#160;and shaking wood shavings out of their hair.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Circe screamed. &#34;You don't understand! Those are the worst!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>One of the men stood up—a huge guy with a long tangled pitch-black beard and teeth the&#160;<br/>same&#160;color. He wore mismatched clothes of&#160;wool and leather, knee-length boots, and a floppy&#160;<br/>felt hat. The other men were dressed more simply—in breeches and stained white shirts. All&#160;<br/>of them&#160;were barefoot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Argggh!&#34; bellowed the big man. &#34;What's the witch done t'me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Circe moaned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth gasped. &#34;I recognize you!&#160;Edward Teach, son of Ares?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Aye, lass,&#34; the big man growled. &#34;Though most&#160;call me&#160;Blackbeard! And there's the&#160;<br/>sorceress what captured us, lads. Run her through, and then I mean to find me&#160;a big bowl of&#160;<br/>celery! Arggggh!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Circe screamed. She and her attendants ran from the room, chased by the pirates.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth sheathed her knife and glared at me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thanks ...&#34; I faltered. &#34;I'm&#160;really sorry—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before I could figure out how to apologize for being such an idiot, she tackled me&#160;with a hug,&#160;<br/>then pulled away just as quickly.&#160;&#34;I'm&#160;glad you're not a guinea pig.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Me, too.&#34; I hoped my&#160;face wasn't&#160;as red as it felt.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She undid the golden braids in her hair.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come on, Seaweed Brain,&#34; she said. &#34;We have&#160;to get away while Circe's distracted.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We ran down the hillside through the terraces, past screaming spa workers and pirates&#160;<br/>ransacking the resort. Blackbeard's men broke the&#160;tiki torches for the luau, threw herbal wraps&#160;<br/>into the swimming pool, and kicked&#160;over tables of sauna towels.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I almost felt bad letting the unruly pirates out, but I guessed&#160;they deserved something more&#160;<br/>entertaining than the exercise wheel after&#160;being cooped up in a cage for three centuries.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Which ship?&#34; Annabeth&#160;said as we reached the docks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked around desperately. We&#160;couldn't very well take our rowboat. We&#160;had to get off the&#160;<br/>island fast, but what else could&#160;we use?&#160;A sub?&#160;A&#160;fighter jet?&#160;I couldn't pilot any of those&#160;<br/>things. And then I saw it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;There,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a>&#160;<br/>Annabeth blinked. &#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I can make it work.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't explain. I just somehow knew an old sailing vessel&#160;was the best bet for me. I&#160;<br/>grabbed Annabeth's&#160;hand and pulled her toward&#160;the three-mast ship. Painted on its prow was&#160;<br/>the name&#160;that I would only decipher later: Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Argggh!&#34; Blackbeard yelled somewhere behind&#160;us. &#34;Those scalawags are a-boarding me&#160;<br/>vessel! Get 'em,&#160;lads!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We'll never get going in time!&#34; Annabeth yelled as we climbed aboard.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked around at the hopeless maze of sail and ropes. The ship was in great condition&#160;for a&#160;<br/>three-hundred-year-old vessel, but it would still take a crew of fifty several hours to get&#160;<br/>underway. We didn't have several hours. I could see the pirates running down the stairs,&#160;<br/>waving tiki torches and&#160;sticks of celery.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I closed my&#160;eyes and concentrated on&#160;the waves lapping against the hull, the ocean currents,&#160;<br/>the winds all around me. Suddenly, the right word appeared in&#160;my&#160;mind. &#34;Mizzenmast!&#34; I&#160;<br/>yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth looked at me&#160;like I was nuts, but in&#160;the&#160;next second, the air was filled with&#160;<br/>whistling sounds of ropes being snapped taut, canvases unfurling, and wooden pulleys&#160;<br/>creaking.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth ducked as a cable flew over her&#160;head and wrapped itself around the bowsprit.&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, how&#160;...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't have an answer, but I could feel the ship responding to me&#160;as if it were part of my&#160;<br/>body. I willed the sails to&#160;rise as&#160;easily as if I were flexing my&#160;arm.&#160;I willed the rudder to turn.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge lurched away from&#160;the dock, and by the time&#160;the pirates arrived at&#160;<br/>the water's edge, we were already underway, sailing into the Sea of Monsters.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>THIRTEEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>ANNABETH TRIES&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>TO SWIM HOME&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=111></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'd finally found something I was really good at.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge responded to my&#160;every com-mand. I knew which ropes to hoist,&#160;<br/>which sails to raise, which direction to steer.&#160;We&#160;plowed through the waves at what I figured&#160;<br/>was about ten knots. I even understood how fast that&#160;was. For a sailing ship, pretty darn fast.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It all felt perfect—the wind in my&#160;face, the waves&#160;break-ing over the prow.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But now that we were out of danger, all I&#160;could think about was how much I missed Tyson,&#160;<br/>and how worried I was about Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't get over how badly I'd messed up on Circe's Island. If it hadn't been for Annabeth,&#160;<br/>I'd still be&#160;a rodent, hiding&#160;in a hutch with a&#160;bunch of cute furry pirates. I thought about what&#160;<br/>Circe had said: See, Percy?&#160;You've unlocked your true self!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I still felt changed. Not just because I had a sudden desire to eat lettuce. I felt jumpy, like the&#160;<br/>instinct to be&#160;a scared little animal was now a&#160;part of me. Or maybe it had always been there.&#160;<br/>That's&#160;what really worried me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We sailed through the night.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth tried to help me&#160;keep lookout, but&#160;sailing didn't agree with&#160;her. After a few hours&#160;<br/>rocking back and forth, her face turned the color of guacamole and she went below to&#160;lie in a&#160;<br/>hammock.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I watched the horizon. More than once I spotted&#160;mon-sters. A plume of&#160;water as tall as a&#160;<br/>skyscraper&#160;spewed into the moonlight. A row of&#160;green spines&#160;slithered across the waves—<br/>something maybe a hundred feet long, reptilian. I didn't really want to know.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Once I saw Nereids, the glowing lady spirits of&#160;the sea. I tried to wave at them, but they&#160;<br/>disappeared into the depths, leaving me&#160;unsure whether they'd&#160;seen me&#160;or not.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sometime after midnight, Annabeth came&#160;up on&#160;deck. We&#160;were&#160;just passing a smoking&#160;<br/>volcano island. The sea bubbled and steamed around the shore.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;One of the forges of Hephaestus,&#34; Annabeth&#160;said. &#34;Where he makes his metal monsters.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Like the bronze bulls?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She nodded. &#34;Go around. Far around.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't need to be told twice. We&#160;steered clear of the island, and soon&#160;it was just a red patch&#160;<br/>of haze behind us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked at Annabeth. &#34;The reason you hate Cyclopes so much ... the story about how Thalia&#160;<br/>really died. What happened?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was hard to see her&#160;expression in the dark.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=112></a>&#34;I guess you deserve to know,&#34;&#160;she said finally. &#34;The night Grover was escorting us to camp,&#160;<br/>he got confused, took some&#160;wrong turns.&#160;You remember he told you that once?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well, the worst wrong turn was into a Cyclops's&#160;lair in Brooklyn.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They've got Cyclopes in Brooklyn?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You wouldn't believe how many, but that's&#160;not&#160;the point. This Cyclops, he tricked us. He&#160;<br/>managed to split us&#160;up inside this maze of corridors in an old&#160;house in Flatbush. And he could&#160;<br/>sound like anyone, Percy. Just the way Tyson did&#160;aboard the Princess Andromeda. He lured&#160;<br/>us, one at a time. Thalia thought&#160;she was running to save Luke. Luke thought he heard me&#160;<br/>scream&#160;for help. And me&#160;... I was alone in the dark. I was seven years old. I couldn't even find&#160;<br/>the exit.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She brushed&#160;the hair out of her face. &#34;I remember&#160;find-ing the main&#160;room. There were&#160;bones&#160;<br/>all over the floor. And there were Thalia and Luke and Grover, tied up and gagged, hanging&#160;<br/>from&#160;the ceiling like smoked hams. The Cyclops was starting a fire in the middle of the floor.&#160;<br/>I drew my&#160;knife, but he heard me. He turned and smiled. He spoke, and somehow he knew&#160;<br/>my dad's voice. I guess he just plucked it out&#160;of my mind. He said, 'Now, Annabeth, don't you&#160;<br/>worry. I love you. You can stay here&#160;with me. You can stay forever.'&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I shivered. The way she told it—even now, six&#160;years later—freaked me&#160;out worse than&#160;any&#160;<br/>ghost story I'd ever heard. &#34;What did you do?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I stabbed him in the foot.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at her. &#34;Are you kidding?&#160;You were&#160;seven years old and you stabbed a grown Cyclops&#160;<br/>in the foot?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, he would've killed me. But I surprised him.&#160;It gave me&#160;just enough time&#160;to run to Thalia&#160;<br/>and cut the ropes on her hands. She took it from&#160;there.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, but still ... that was&#160;pretty brave, Annabeth.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She shook her head. &#34;We barely got out alive.&#160;I still have nightmares, Percy. The way that&#160;<br/>Cyclops talked in my&#160;father's&#160;voice. It was his fault we took so long&#160;getting to camp. All the&#160;<br/>monsters who'd been chasing us had time&#160;to catch up. That's&#160;really why Thalia died. If&#160;it&#160;<br/>hadn't been for that Cyclops,&#160;she'd still be alive today.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We sat on the deck, watching the Hercules&#160;constellation rise&#160;in the night sky.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go below,&#34; Annabeth told me&#160;at last. &#34;You need some&#160;rest.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded. My eyes were heavy. But when I&#160;got below and found a hammock, it took me&#160;a&#160;<br/>long time to fall asleep. I kept thinking about Annabeth's&#160;story. I wondered, if I were her,&#160;<br/>would I have had enough courage to go on this quest,&#160;to sail straight toward the lair of another&#160;<br/>Cyclops?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=113></a>I didn't dream about Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Instead I found myself back in Luke's&#160;stateroom&#160;aboard the Princess Andromeda. The curtains&#160;<br/>were open. It was nighttime&#160;outside. The air swirled with shadows. Voices whispered all&#160;<br/>around me—spirits of the dead.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Beware, they whispered. Traps. Trickery.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Kronos's&#160;golden sarcophagus glowed faintly—the only source of light in the room.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A cold laugh startled me. It seemed to come&#160;from miles below the ship. You don't have the&#160;<br/>courage, young one. You can't&#160;stop me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew what I had to do. I had to open that coffin.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I uncapped Riptide. Ghosts whirled around me&#160;like a tornado. Beware!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My heart pounded. I couldn't make my feet move, but I had to stop Kronos. I had to destroy&#160;<br/>whatever was in that box.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then a girl spoke right next to me: &#34;Well, Seaweed Brain?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked over, expecting to see Annabeth, but&#160;the girl wasn't&#160;Annabeth. She wore punk-style&#160;<br/>clothes with silver chains on her wrists. She&#160;had spiky black hair, dark eye-liner around her&#160;<br/>stormy&#160;blue eyes, and a spray of freckles across her nose. She looked familiar, but I wasn't&#160;<br/>sure why.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well?&#34; she asked. &#34;Are we&#160;going to stop him&#160;or not?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't answer. I couldn't move.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The girl rolled her eyes. &#34;Fine.&#160;Leave it to me&#160;and Aegis.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She tapped her wrist and her silver chains transformed—&#160;flattening and expanding into a huge&#160;<br/>shield. It was silver and bronze, with&#160;the&#160;monstrous face of Medusa protruding from&#160;the&#160;<br/>center. It looked like a death mask, as if the gorgon's real head had been pressed into the&#160;<br/>metal. I didn't&#160;know if that was true, or if the shield could&#160;really petrify me, but I looked&#160;<br/>away. Just being near it made me&#160;cold&#160;with fear.&#160;I got a feeling that in&#160;a real fight, the bearer&#160;<br/>of that shield would be almost impossible&#160;to beat. Any sane enemy would turn and run.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The girl drew her sword and advanced on the sarcoph-agus. The shadowy ghosts parted for&#160;<br/>her, scattering before the terrible aura of her shield.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; I tried to warn her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But she didn't&#160;listen. She marched straight up&#160;to the sarcophagus and&#160;pushed aside the golden&#160;<br/>lid.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>For a moment she stood there, gazing down at what-ever was in the box.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The coffin began to glow.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=114></a>&#34;No.&#34; The girl's&#160;voice trembled. &#34;It can't&#160;be.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>From&#160;the depths of the ocean, Kronos laughed so loudly the whole ship trembled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; The girl screamed as the sarcophagus&#160;engulfed her in a blast of a golden light.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah!&#34; I sat bolt upright in my&#160;hammock.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth was shaking me. &#34;Percy, you were having a nightmare. You need to get up.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Wh—what is it?&#34; I rubbed my&#160;eyes. &#34;What's wrong?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Land,&#34; she said grimly. &#34;We're approaching the island of the Sirens.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I could barely make out the island ahead&#160;of us—just a dark spot in the mist.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I want you to do me&#160;a favor,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;The Sirens ... we'll be in range of their singing&#160;<br/>soon.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I remembered stories about the Sirens. They sang so sweetly their voices enchanted sailors&#160;<br/>and lured them&#160;to their death.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No problem,&#34; I assured her. &#34;We can just stop up our ears. There's a big tub of candle wax&#160;<br/>below deck—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I want to hear them.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I blinked. &#34;Why?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They say the Sirens sing the truth about what&#160;you desire. They tell&#160;you things about yourself&#160;<br/>you didn't even realize. That's&#160;what's so enchanting. If you survive ... you become&#160;wiser. I&#160;<br/>want to hear&#160;them. How often will I get that&#160;chance?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Coming from most people, this would've made&#160;no sense. But Annabeth being who she was—<br/>well, if she could struggle through Ancient Greek architecture books and enjoy documentaries&#160;<br/>on the History Channel, I guessed the&#160;Sirens would appeal to her, too.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She told me&#160;her plan. Reluctantly, I helped her get ready.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As soon as the rocky coastline of the island came into view, I ordered one&#160;of the ropes to wrap&#160;<br/>around Annabeth's&#160;waist, tying her to the foremast.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't untie me,&#34; she said, &#34;no matter what happens or how much I plead. I'll want to go&#160;<br/>straight over the edge&#160;and drown myself.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Are you trying to tempt me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ha-ha.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=115></a>I promised I'd keep her secure. Then I took two large wads of candle wax, kneaded them into&#160;<br/>earplugs, and stuffed my&#160;ears.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth nodded sarcastically, letting me&#160;know the&#160;earplugs were a real fashion statement. I&#160;<br/>made a face at her and turned to the pilot's wheel.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The silence was eerie. I couldn't hear anything&#160;but the rush of blood in my head. As we&#160;<br/>approached the island, jagged rocks loomed&#160;out of the fog. I willed the Queen Anne's&#160;<br/>Revenge to skirt around them. If&#160;we sailed any closer, those rocks would shred our hull like&#160;<br/>blender blades.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I glanced back. At first, Annabeth seemed totally normal. Then she got a puzzled look on her&#160;<br/>face. Her eyes widened.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She strained&#160;against the ropes. She called my&#160;name—I could tell just from reading her lips.&#160;<br/>Her expression was clear: She had to get out. This&#160;was life or death. I had&#160;to let her out of the&#160;<br/>ropes right now.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She seemed so miserable it was hard not to cut her free.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I forced myself to look away. I urged&#160;the Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge to go faster.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I still couldn't&#160;see much of&#160;the island—just mist and rocks—but floating in the water were&#160;<br/>pieces of wood and fiberglass, the wreckage of old ships, even some&#160;flotation cushions&#160;from&#160;<br/>airplanes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>How could music cause so many lives to veer off course?&#160;I mean, sure, there were some&#160;Top&#160;<br/>Forty songs that made me want to take a fiery nosedive, but still ... What could the Sirens&#160;<br/>possibly sing about?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>For one dangerous moment, I understood Annabeth's&#160;curiosity. I was tempted to take out the&#160;<br/>earplugs, just to get a taste of&#160;the song. I could feel the Sirens'&#160;voices vibrating in the timbers&#160;<br/>of the ship, pulsing along with&#160;the roar of blood in my&#160;ears.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth was pleading with me. Tears streamed&#160;down her cheeks. She strained against the&#160;<br/>ropes, as if they were holding her&#160;back from&#160;everything she cared about.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>How could you be so cruel?&#160;She seemed to be asking me. I thought you were my&#160;friend.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I glared at the misty island. I wanted to uncap my&#160;sword, but there was nothing to fight. How&#160;<br/>do you fight a song?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried hard not to look at Annabeth. I managed it for about five minutes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That was my big mistake.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When I couldn't stand it any longer, I looked back&#160;and found ... a heap of cut ropes. An empty&#160;<br/>mast. Annabeth's&#160;bronze knife lay on the deck.&#160;Somehow, she'd managed to wriggle it into&#160;<br/>her hand. I'd totally forgotten to disarm&#160;her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I rushed to the side of the boat and saw her,&#160;paddling madly for the island, the waves carrying&#160;<br/>her straight toward the jagged rocks.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=116></a>&#160;<br/>I screamed her name, but if she heard me, it didn't do any good. She was entranced,&#160;<br/>swimming toward her death.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked back at the pilot's wheel and yelled, &#34;Stay!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I jumped over the side.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I sliced into the water and&#160;willed the currents to bend around&#160;me, making a jet stream&#160;that&#160;<br/>shot me&#160;forward.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I came to the surface and spotted Annabeth, but&#160;a wave caught her, sweeping her between two&#160;<br/>razor-sharp fangs of rock.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I had no choice. I plunged after her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I dove under the wrecked hull of a yacht, wove&#160;through a collection of floating metal balls on&#160;<br/>chains that I realized afterward were mines. I had to use all my power over water to avoid&#160;<br/>getting smashed against the rocks or tangled in&#160;the nets of barbed wire strung just below the&#160;<br/>surface.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I jetted between the two rock&#160;fangs and found myself in a half-moon-shaped bay. The water&#160;<br/>was choked with more rocks and ship wreckage and floating mines. The beach was black&#160;<br/>volcanic sand.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked around desperately for Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>There she was.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luckily or unluckily, she was a strong swimmer.&#160;She'd made it past the mines and the rocks.&#160;<br/>She was almost to the black beach.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then the mist cleared and I saw them—the Sirens.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Imagine a flock of vultures the&#160;size of people—with dirty black&#160;plumage, gray talons, and&#160;<br/>wrinkled pink necks. Now imagine human heads on top of those necks, but the human heads&#160;<br/>keep changing.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't hear them, but I could see they were&#160;singing. As their mouths moved, their faces&#160;<br/>morphed into people I knew—my mom,&#160;Poseidon, Grover, Tyson, Chiron. All the people I&#160;<br/>most wanted&#160;to see. They&#160;smiled reassuringly, invit-ing me&#160;forward. But no matter what&#160;<br/>shape they took, their mouths were greasy and caked with the remnants of old meals. Like&#160;<br/>vultures, they'd&#160;been eating with their faces, and it didn't look like they'd&#160;been feasting on&#160;<br/>Monster Donuts.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth swam&#160;toward them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew I couldn't let her get out of the water.&#160;The sea was my&#160;only advantage. It had always&#160;<br/>protected me one way or another. I propelled myself forward and grabbed her inkle.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The moment I touched her, a shock went through my&#160;body, and I saw&#160;the Sirens the way&#160;<br/>Annabeth must've been seeing them.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=117></a>&#160;<br/>Three people sat on a picnic blanket in Central&#160;Park. A feast was spread out before them. I&#160;<br/>recognized Annabeth's&#160;dad from&#160;photos she'd shown me—an athletic-looking, sandy-haired&#160;<br/>guy in his forties. He was holding hands with&#160;a beautiful woman who looked a lot like&#160;<br/>Annabeth. She was dressed casually—in blue jeans and a denim&#160;shirt and hik-ing boots—but&#160;<br/>something about the woman radiated power. I knew that I was looking at the goddess Athena.&#160;<br/>Next to them sat a young man ... Luke.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The whole scene glowed&#160;in a&#160;warm, buttery light. The three of&#160;them&#160;were talking and&#160;<br/>laughing, and when they saw Annabeth, their faces lit up with delight. Annabeth's&#160;mom&#160;and&#160;<br/>dad held out their arms&#160;invitingly. Luke grinned and gestured&#160;for Annabeth to sit next to&#160;<br/>him—as if he'd&#160;never betrayed her,&#160;as if he were still her friend.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Behind the trees of Central Park, a city skyline rose. I caught my breath, because it was&#160;<br/>Manhattan, but not Manhattan. It&#160;had been totally rebuilt from&#160;dazzling white marble, bigger&#160;<br/>and grander than ever—with golden win-dows and&#160;rooftop gardens. It&#160;was better than New&#160;<br/>York. Better than Mount Olympus.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew immediately that Annabeth had designed&#160;it all. She was the architect for a whole new&#160;<br/>world. She had reunited her parents. She had saved Luke. She had done everything she'd ever&#160;<br/>wanted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I blinked hard. When I opened my&#160;eyes, all&#160;I saw were the Sirens—ragged vultures with&#160;<br/>human faces, ready to feed on another victim.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I pulled Annabeth back into the surf. I couldn't hear her, but I could tell she was screaming.&#160;<br/>She kicked me&#160;in the face, but I held on.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I willed the currents to carry us out into the bay. Annabeth pummeled and kicked me, making&#160;<br/>it hard to con-centrate. She thrashed so much&#160;we almost collided with a floating mine. I didn't&#160;<br/>know what to do. I'd never get back to&#160;the ship alive if she kept fighting.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We went under and Annabeth stopped struggling.&#160;Her expression became confused. Then our&#160;<br/>heads broke the sur-face and&#160;she started to fight again.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The water! Sound didn't travel well underwater.&#160;If I could submerge her long enough, I could&#160;<br/>break the spell of the music. Of course, Annabeth wouldn't be able to breathe, but at the&#160;<br/>moment, that seemed like a minor problem.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I grabbed her around the waist and ordered the waves to push us down.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We shot into&#160;the depths—ten feet, twenty feet. I knew I had to be careful because I could&#160;<br/>withstand a lot more pressure than Annabeth.&#160;She fought and struggled for breath as bubbles&#160;<br/>rose around us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Bubbles.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was desperate. I had to keep Annabeth alive.&#160;I imag-ined all the bubbles in the sea—always&#160;<br/>churning, rising. I imagined them&#160;coming&#160;together, being pulled toward me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=118></a>The sea obeyed. There was a flurry of white, a&#160;tickling sensation all around me, and when my&#160;<br/>vision cleared, Annabeth and I had a huge bubble of&#160;air around us. Only our legs stuck into&#160;<br/>the water.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She gasped and coughed. Her whole body shuddered, but when she looked at me, I knew the&#160;<br/>spell had been broken.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She started to sob—I mean horrible, heartbroken sobbing. She put her head on my&#160;shoulder&#160;<br/>and I held her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Fish gathered to look at us—a school&#160;of barracudas, some&#160;curious marlins.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Scram!&#160;I told them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They swam&#160;off, but I could tell they went reluctantly. I swear I understood their intentions.&#160;<br/>They were about to start rumors flying around the sea about the son of Poseidon and some&#160;girl&#160;<br/>at the bottom of Siren Bay.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll get us back to the ship,&#34; I&#160;told her. &#34;It's okay. Just hang on.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth nodded to let me&#160;know she was better now, then she murmured something I&#160;<br/>couldn't hear because&#160;of the wax in my ears.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I made the current steer our weird little air submarine through the rocks and barbed wire and&#160;<br/>back toward the hull of the Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge, which was maintaining a slow and steady&#160;<br/>course away from&#160;the island.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We stayed underwater, following the ship, until&#160;I judged we had moved out of earshot of the&#160;<br/>Sirens. Then&#160;I surfaced and our air bubble popped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I ordered a rope ladder to drop over the side of the ship, and we climbed aboard.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I kept my&#160;earplugs in, just to be sure.&#160;We&#160;sailed until the island&#160;was completely out of&#160;sight.&#160;<br/>Annabeth sat huddled in a blanket on&#160;the forward&#160;deck. Finally she looked&#160;up, dazed and sad,&#160;<br/>and mouthed, safe.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I took out the earplugs. No singing. The afternoon was quiet&#160;except for the sound of the&#160;<br/>waves against the hull. The fog had burned away to&#160;a blue sky, as if the island of the Sirens&#160;<br/>had never existed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You okay?&#34; I asked. The moment I said it, I realized how lame&#160;that sounded. Of course she&#160;<br/>wasn't&#160;okay.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I didn't realize,&#34; she murmured.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Her eyes were the same&#160;color as the mist&#160;over the Sirens'&#160;island. &#34;How powerful the&#160;<br/>temptation would be.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't want to admit that I'd seen what the Sirens had promised her. I felt like a trespasser.&#160;<br/>But I figured I owed it to Annabeth.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=119></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;I saw the way you rebuilt Manhattan,&#34; I told her. &#34;And Luke and your parents.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She blushed. &#34;You saw that?&#34;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What Luke&#160;told you back on the Princess Andromeda, about starting the world from&#160;scratch&#160;<br/>... that really got to you, huh?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She pulled her blanket around her. &#34;My fatal flaw. That's&#160;what the Sirens showed me. My&#160;<br/>fatal flaw is hubris.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I blinked. &#34;That brown stuff they spread on veggie sandwiches?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She rolled her eyes. &#34;No, Seaweed Brain. That's&#160;hummus. Hubris is worse.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What could be worse than hummus?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hubris means deadly pride, Percy. Thinking&#160;you can do things better&#160;than anyone else ...&#160;<br/>even the gods.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You feel that way?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She looked down. &#34;Don't you ever feel&#160;like, what if the world really is messed up?&#160;What if we&#160;<br/>could do it all over again from&#160;scratch?&#160;No&#160;more war. Nobody homeless. No more summer&#160;<br/>reading homework.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;listening.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I mean, the West represents a lot of the best&#160;things mankind ever did—that's&#160;why the fire is&#160;<br/>still burning. That's&#160;why Olympus is still around. But sometimes you just see the bad stuff,&#160;<br/>you know?&#160;And you start thinking the way Luke does:&#160;'If I could tear this all down, I would&#160;<br/>do it better.'&#160;Don't you ever feel&#160;that way?&#160;Like you could&#160;do a better job if you ran the&#160;<br/>world?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Um&#160;... no. Me running the world would kind of be a nightmare.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Then you're lucky. Hubris isn't your fatal flaw.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What is?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I don't know, Percy, but every hero has one. If you&#160;don't find it and learn to&#160;control it ... well,&#160;<br/>they don't call it 'fatal'&#160;for nothing.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought about that. It didn't exactly cheer me&#160;up.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I also noticed Annabeth hadn't said much about&#160;the per-sonal things she would change—like&#160;<br/>getting her parents back together, or saving&#160;Luke. I understood. I didn't want to admit how&#160;<br/>many times I'd dreamed of getting&#160;my own par-ents back together.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I pictured my&#160;mom,&#160;alone in our little apartment on the Upper East Side. I tried to remember&#160;<br/>the smell of her blue waffles in the kitchen. It seemed so far away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=120></a>&#34;So was it worth it?&#34; I asked Annabeth. &#34;Do you feel ... wiser?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She gazed into the distance. &#34;I'm&#160;not sure. But we have to save&#160;the camp. If we don't stop&#160;<br/>Luke ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She didn't need to finish. If Luke's&#160;way of thinking could even tempt Annabeth, there was no&#160;<br/>telling how many other half-bloods might join him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought about my&#160;dream of the girl and the golden sarcophagus. I wasn't&#160;sure what it meant,&#160;<br/>but I got the feel-ing I was missing something. Something terrible that Kronos was planning.&#160;<br/>What had the girl seen when&#160;she opened that coffin lid?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Suddenly Annabeth's&#160;eyes widened. &#34;Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I turned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Up ahead was another blotch of&#160;land—a saddle-shaped island&#160;with forested&#160;hills and white&#160;<br/>beaches and green meadows—just like I'd seen in my&#160;dreams.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My nautical senses confirmed it. 30 degrees,&#160;31 min-utes north, 75 degrees, 12 minutes west.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We had reached the home of the Cyclops.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>FOURTEEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WE MEET THE SHEEP&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>OF DOOM&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When you think &#34;monster island,&#34; you think craggy rocks and bones scattered on the beach&#160;<br/>like the island&#160;of&#160;the Sirens.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Cyclops's&#160;island was nothing like that. I mean, okay, it had a rope bridge across a chasm,&#160;<br/>which was not a good sign. You might as well&#160;put up a billboard that said, SOMETHING&#160;<br/>EVIL LIVES HERE. But except for that, the place looked like a Caribbean postcard. It had&#160;<br/>green fields&#160;and tropical fruit trees and white&#160;beaches. As we sailed toward the shore,&#160;<br/>Annabeth breathed in the sweet air. &#34;The Fleece,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded. I couldn't see the Fleece yet, but I could&#160;feel its power. I could believe&#160;it would heal&#160;<br/>anything, even Thalia's&#160;poisoned tree. &#34;If we take it away, will the island die?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth shook her head. &#34;It'll fade. Go back to&#160;what it would be normally, whatever that is.&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=121></a>&#160;<br/>I felt a little guilty about ruining this paradise, but I reminded myself we had no choice. Camp&#160;<br/>Half-Blood was in trouble. And Tyson ... Tyson would still be with us if it wasn't&#160;for this&#160;<br/>quest.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In the meadow at the base of the ravine, several dozen sheep&#160;were milling around. They&#160;<br/>looked peaceful enough, but they were huge—the size of hippos. Just past them&#160;was a path&#160;<br/>that led up into the hills.&#160;At the top of&#160;the path, near the edge of the canyon, was the massive&#160;<br/>oak tree I'd seen in my&#160;dreams. Something gold glittered in its branches.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This is too easy,&#34; I said. &#34;We could&#160;just hike up there and take it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth's&#160;eyes narrowed. &#34;There's&#160;supposed be a guardian. A dragon or ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's&#160;when a deer emerged from&#160;the bushes. It&#160;trotted into the meadow, probably looking for&#160;<br/>grass to eat, when the sheep all bleated at once&#160;and rushed the animal. It hap-pened so fast&#160;<br/>that the deer stumbled and was lost&#160;in a sea of wool and trampling hooves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grass and tufts of fur flew&#160;into the air.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A second later the sheep all moved away, back&#160;to&#160;their regular peaceful wanderings. Where&#160;<br/>the deer had been was a pile of clean white bones.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and I exchanged looks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They're like piranhas,&#34; she said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Piranhas with wool. How will we—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy!&#34; Annabeth gasped,&#160;grabbing my&#160;arm.&#160;&#34;Look.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She pointed down the beach, to just below the sheep meadow, where a small boat had been&#160;<br/>run aground ... the other lifeboat from the CSS Birmingham.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We decided there was no way we could get past the man-eating sheep. Annabeth wanted to&#160;<br/>sneak up the path invisi-bly and grab the Fleece,&#160;but in the end I convinced her that something&#160;<br/>would go wrong. The sheep would smell her. Another guardian would appear. Something.&#160;<br/>And if that happened, I'd be too far away to help.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Besides, our first job was to find Grover and whoever had come&#160;ashore in that lifeboat—<br/>assuming they'd&#160;gotten past the sheep. I was too&#160;nervous to say what I was secretly hoping ...&#160;<br/>that Tyson might still be&#160;alive.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We moored the Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge on the back&#160;side of the island where the cliffs rose&#160;<br/>straight up a good two hun-dred feet. I figured the&#160;ship was less likely to&#160;be seen there. The&#160;<br/>cliffs looked climbable, barely—about as difficult as the lava&#160;wall back at camp. At least it&#160;<br/>was free of sheep. I hoped that Polyphemus did&#160;not also keep carnivorous mountain goats.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We rowed a lifeboat to the edge&#160;of the rocks and made our way up, very slowly. Annabeth&#160;<br/>went first because she&#160;was the better climber.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=122></a>&#160;<br/>We only came close to dying six or seven times,&#160;which I thought was pretty good. Once, I lost&#160;<br/>my grip and I found myself dangling by one hand from&#160;a ledge fifty feet above the rocky surf.&#160;<br/>But I found another handhold and kept climbing. A&#160;minute later Annabeth hit a slippery patch&#160;<br/>of moss and her foot&#160;slipped. Fortunately, she found some-thing else to put it against.&#160;<br/>Unfortunately, that something was my face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sorry,&#34; she murmured.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;S'okay,&#34; I grunted, though I'd never really wanted to know what Annabeth's&#160;sneaker tasted&#160;<br/>like.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Finally, when my&#160;fingers felt like molten lead&#160;and&#160;my&#160;arm&#160;muscles&#160;were shaking from&#160;<br/>exhaustion, we hauled our-selves over&#160;the top of the cliff and collapsed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ugh,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ouch,&#34; moaned Annabeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Garrr!&#34; bellowed&#160;another voice.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>If I hadn't been so tired, I would've leaped&#160;another two hundred feet. I whirled around, but I&#160;<br/>couldn't see who'd spoken.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth clamped her hand over my&#160;mouth. She pointed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The ledge we&#160;were sitting on was narrower than I'd real-ized. It dropped off on the opposite&#160;<br/>side, and that's&#160;where the voice&#160;was coming from—right below us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're a feisty one!&#34; the deep voice bellowed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Challenge me!&#34; Clarisse's&#160;voice, no doubt about&#160;it. &#34;Give me&#160;back my&#160;sword and I'll fight&#160;<br/>you!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The monster roared with laughter.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and I crept to the edge. We&#160;were right above the entrance of&#160;the Cyclops's&#160;cave.&#160;<br/>Below us stood Polyphemus and Grover, still&#160;in his wedding dress.&#160;Clarisse was tied up,&#160;<br/>hanging upside down over a pot of boiling water.&#160;I was half hoping to see Tyson down there,&#160;<br/>too. Even if he'd&#160;been in danger, at least&#160;I would've known he was alive. But there was no&#160;<br/>sign of him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hmm,&#34; Polyphemus pondered. &#34;Eat loudmouth girl now or wait for wedding feast?&#160;What&#160;<br/>does my&#160;bride think?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He turned to Grover, who backed up and almost&#160;tripped over his completed bridal train. &#34;Oh,&#160;<br/>um, I'm not hungry right now, dear. Perhaps—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Did you say bride?&#34; Clarisse demanded. &#34;Who— Grover?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Next to me, Annabeth muttered, &#34;Shut up. She has to shut up.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=123></a>Polyphemus&#160;glowered. &#34;What 'Grover'?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The satyr!&#34; Clarisse yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh!&#34; Grover yelped. &#34;The poor thing's brain&#160;is boiling from&#160;that hot water. Pull her down,&#160;<br/>dear!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus's eyelids narrowed over his baleful milky&#160;eye, as if he were&#160;trying to see Clarisse&#160;<br/>more clearly.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Cyclops was an even more horrible sight than&#160;he had been in my&#160;dreams. Partly because&#160;<br/>his rancid smell was now up close and personal.&#160;Partly because he was dressed in his wedding&#160;<br/>outfit—a crude kilt and shoulder-wrap, stitched together from&#160;baby-blue tuxedoes, as if the&#160;<br/>he'd&#160;skinned an entire wedding party.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What satyr?&#34; asked Polyphemus. &#34;Satyrs&#160;are good eat-ing. You bring me a satyr?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, you big idiot!&#34; bellowed Clarisse. &#34;That&#160;satyr! Grover! The one in the wedding dress!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to wring Clarisse's&#160;neck, but it was&#160;too late. All I could do was watch as Polyphemus&#160;<br/>turned and ripped off Grover's wedding veil—revealing his curly hair, his scruffy adolescent&#160;<br/>beard, his tiny horns.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;breathed heavily, trying&#160;to contain his anger. &#34;I don't see very well,&#34; he growled.&#160;<br/>&#34;Not since many years ago when the other&#160;hero stabbed me&#160;in eye. But YOU'RE—NO—<br/>LADY—CYCLOPS!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Cyclops grabbed Grover's dress and tore&#160;it away. Underneath, the old Grover reappeared&#160;<br/>in his jeans and T-shirt. He yelped and&#160;ducked as the monster swiped over his head.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stop!&#34; Grover pleaded. &#34;Don't eat&#160;me&#160;raw! I—I have a good recipe!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I reached for my&#160;sword, but Annabeth hissed, &#34;Wait!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;was hesitating, a boulder in his hand, ready to smash his would-be bride.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Recipe?&#34; he asked Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh y-yes! You don't want to eat me raw. You'll&#160;get E coli and botulism&#160;and all sorts of&#160;<br/>horrible things. I'll taste much better grilled over a slow fire. With mango chutney! You could&#160;<br/>go get some&#160;mangos right now, down there&#160;in the woods. I'll just wait here.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The monster pondered this. My heart hammered against my&#160;ribs. I figured I'd die if I charged.&#160;<br/>But I couldn't&#160;let the monster kill Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Grilled satyr with mango chutney,&#34; Polyphemus&#160;mused. He looked back&#160;at Clarisse, still&#160;<br/>hanging over the pot of boiling&#160;water. &#34;You a satyr, too?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, you overgrown pile of dung!&#34; she yelled. &#34;I'm&#160;a girl! The daughter of Ares! Now untie&#160;<br/>me&#160;so I can rip your arms off!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Rip my&#160;arms&#160;off,&#34; Polyphemus repeated.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=124></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;And stuff them&#160;down your throat!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You got spunk.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let me&#160;down!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;snatched up&#160;Grover as if&#160;he were a wayward puppy. &#160;&#34;Have to graze sheep now.&#160;<br/>Wedding postponed until tonight. Then we'll eat satyr for the main course!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But ... you're still getting married?&#34;&#160;Grover sounded&#160;hurt. &#34;Who's&#160;the bride?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;looked toward the boiling pot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse made a strangled sound. &#34;Oh, no! You can't&#160;be serious. I'm&#160;not—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before Annabeth or I could do anything, Polyphemus plucked her off the rope like she was a&#160;<br/>ripe apple, and tossed her and Grover deep into&#160;the cave. &#34;Make yourself&#160;comfortable! I come&#160;<br/>back at sundown for big event!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then the Cyclops whistled, and a mixed flock of goats and sheep—smaller than the man-<br/>eaters—flooded out of the cave and past their master. As they went to pasture, Polyphemus&#160;<br/>patted some&#160;on the back and called them&#160;by&#160;name—Beltbuster, Tammany, Lockhart, etc.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>When the last sheep had waddled out, Polyphemus&#160;rolled a boulder in front of the doorway as&#160;<br/>easily as I would close a refrigerator door, shutting off the sound of Clarisse and Grover&#160;<br/>screaming inside.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Mangos,&#34; Polyphemus grumbled to himself. &#34;What are mangos?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He strolled off down the mountain in his baby-blue groom's&#160;outfit,&#160;leaving us alone with a pot&#160;<br/>of boiling water and a six-ton boulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We tried for what seemed like hours, but&#160;it was no good. The boulder wouldn't move. We&#160;<br/>yelled into the cracks, tapped on&#160;the rock, did everything we could think of to get a signal to&#160;<br/>Grover, but if he heard us, we couldn't&#160;tell.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Even if by some&#160;miracle we managed to kill Polyphemus, it wouldn't do us any good. Grover&#160;<br/>and Clarisse would die inside that sealed cave. The only way to move the rock was to have&#160;<br/>the Cyclops do it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In total frustration, I stabbed Riptide against the boul-der. Sparks flew, but nothing else&#160;<br/>happened. A large rock is not the kind of&#160;enemy you can fight with a magic sword.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and I sat on the ridge&#160;in despair and watched the distant baby-blue shape of the&#160;<br/>Cyclops as he moved among his flocks. He had&#160;wisely divided his regular animals from his&#160;<br/>man-eating sheep, putting each group on either side of the huge crevice that divided the&#160;<br/>island. The only way across was the rope bridge,&#160;and the planks were much too far apart for&#160;<br/>sheep hooves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=125></a>We watched as Polyphemus visited his carnivorous&#160;flock on the far side. Unfortunately, they&#160;<br/>didn't eat him. In fact, they didn't seem&#160;to bother him&#160;at all. He fed them chunks of mystery&#160;<br/>meat from&#160;a great wicker basket, which only reinforced the feelings I'd been having since&#160;<br/>Circe turned&#160;me&#160;into a guinea pig—that maybe it was time I joined Grover and became a&#160;<br/>vegetarian.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Trickery,&#34; Annabeth decided. &#34;We can't&#160;beat him by force, so we'll have to use trickery.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said. &#34;What trick?'&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I haven't figured that part out yet.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Great.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Polyphemus will have&#160;to move the rock to let the sheep inside.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;At sunset,&#34; I said. &#34;Which is when he'll marry&#160;Clarisse and have Grover for dinner. I'm not&#160;<br/>sure which is grosser.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I could get inside,&#34;&#160;she said, &#34;invisibly.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What about me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The sheep,&#34; Annabeth mused. She gave me&#160;one&#160;of those sly looks that always made me&#160;<br/>wary. &#34;How much do you like sheep?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just don't let go!&#34; Annabeth said, standing invisibly some-where off to my&#160;right. That was&#160;<br/>easy for her to say. She wasn't&#160;hanging upside down from&#160;the&#160;belly of a sheep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now, I'll admit it wasn't&#160;as hard as I'd thought.&#160;I'd crawled under a car before to change my&#160;<br/>mom's oil, and this wasn't&#160;too different. The&#160;sheep didn't care. Even the Cyclops's&#160;smallest&#160;<br/>sheep were big enough to support my weight, and they had thick wool. I just twirled the stuff&#160;<br/>into handles for my&#160;hands, hooked my feet against the sheep's&#160;thigh bones, and presto—I felt&#160;<br/>like a baby wallaby, riding around against the sheep's&#160;chest, trying to keep the wool out of my&#160;<br/>mouth and my nose.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In case you're wondering, the underside of a sheep&#160;doesn't&#160;smell that great. Imagine a winter&#160;<br/>sweater that's&#160;been dragged through the mud&#160;and left in the laundry hamper for a week.&#160;<br/>Something like that.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The sun was going down.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No sooner was I in position than the Cyclops roared, &#34;Oy! Goaties! Sheepies!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The flock dutifully began trudging back up the slopes toward the cave.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This is it!&#34; Annabeth whispered.&#160;&#34;I'll be close by. Don't worry.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I made a silent promise to the gods that if we survived this, I'd tell Annabeth she was a genius.&#160;<br/>The frightening thing was, I knew the gods would hold me&#160;to it.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=126></a>&#160;<br/>My sheep taxi started plodding up the hill. After&#160;a hun-dred yards, my&#160;hands and feet started&#160;<br/>to hurt from&#160;holding on. I gripped the sheep's&#160;wool more tightly, and the animal made a&#160;<br/>grumbling sound. I didn't blame it. I wouldn't want anybody rock climbing in my&#160;hair either.&#160;<br/>But if I didn't hold on, I was sure I'd fall off right there in front of the monster.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hasenpfeffer!&#34; the Cyclops said, patting one of the sheep in&#160;front of me. &#34;Einstein!&#160;<br/>Widget—eh there, Widget!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;patted my&#160;sheep and nearly knocked me&#160;to the ground. &#34;Putting on some&#160;extra&#160;<br/>mutton there?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Uh-oh, I thought. Here it comes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But Polyphemus just laughed and swatted the sheep's rear end, propelling us forward. &#34;Go on,&#160;<br/>fatty! Soon Polyphemus will eat you&#160;for breakfast!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And just like that, I was in the cave.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I could see the last of the sheep coming inside. If&#160;Annabeth didn't pull off her distraction soon&#160;<br/>...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Cyclops was about to roll the stone back&#160;into&#160;place, when&#160;from&#160;somewhere outside&#160;<br/>Annabeth shouted, &#34;Hello, ugly!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;stiffened. &#34;Who said that?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nobody!&#34; Annabeth yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That got exactly the reaction she'd been hoping for. The monster's face turned red with&#160;rage.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nobody!&#34; Polyphemus&#160;yelled back. &#34;I remember&#160;you!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're too stupid to remember anybody,&#34;&#160;Annabeth taunted. &#34;Much less Nobody.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hoped to the gods she was already moving&#160;when she said that, because Polyphemus&#160;<br/>bellowed furiously, grabbed the nearest boulder&#160;(which happened to be his front door) and&#160;<br/>threw it toward the sound of Annabeth's&#160;voice. I heard the rock smash into a thousand&#160;<br/>fragments.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>For a terrible moment, there was silence. Then Annabeth shouted, &#34;You haven't learned to&#160;<br/>throw any better, either!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus howled. &#34;Come here! Let me&#160;kill you, Nobody!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You can't&#160;kill Nobody, you stupid oaf,&#34; she taunted. &#34;Come find me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;barreled down the hill toward her voice.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now, the &#34;Nobody&#34; thing wouldn't have made sense to anybody, but Annabeth had explained&#160;<br/>to me&#160;that it was the name Odysseus had used&#160;to trick Polyphemus centuries ago, right before&#160;<br/>he poked the Cyclops's&#160;eye out with a large&#160;hot stick. Annabeth had figured Polyphemus&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=127></a>would still have a grudge about that name, and&#160;she was right. In his frenzy to find his old&#160;<br/>enemy, he forgot about resealing the cave entrance. Apparently, he didn't even stop to&#160;<br/>consider that Annabeth's&#160;voice was female, whereas the first Nobody had been male. On the&#160;<br/>other hand, he'd&#160;wanted to marry Grover, so he&#160;couldn't have been all that bright about the&#160;<br/>whole male/female thing.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I just hoped Annabeth could stay alive and keep dis-tracting him long enough for me&#160;to find&#160;<br/>Grover and Clarisse.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I dropped off my&#160;ride, patted Widget on the head, and apologized. I searched the main room,&#160;<br/>but there was no sign of Grover or Clarisse.&#160;I pushed through the crowd of sheep and goats&#160;<br/>toward the back of the cave.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Even though&#160;I'd dreamed about this place, I&#160;had a hard time&#160;finding my&#160;way through the&#160;<br/>maze. I ran down corri-dors littered&#160;with bones, past rooms full of&#160;sheepskin rugs and&#160;life-size&#160;<br/>cement sheep that I recognized as the work of&#160;Medusa. There were collections of sheep T-<br/>shirts; large tubs of lanolin cream;&#160;and wooly coats, socks, and hats with ram's horns. Finally,&#160;<br/>I found the spinning room, where Grover was huddled&#160;in the corner, trying to cut Clarisse's&#160;<br/>bonds with a pair of safety scissors.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's no good,&#34; Clarisse said. &#34;This rope is like iron!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Just a few more minutes!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Grover,&#34; she cried, exasperated. &#34;You've been working at it for hours!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And then they saw me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy?&#34; Clarisse&#160;said. &#34;You're&#160;supposed to be blown up!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Good to see you, too. Now hold still while I—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Perrrrrcy!&#34; Grover bleated and tackled me&#160;with a goat-hug. &#34;You heard me! You came!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, buddy,&#34; I said. &#34;Of course I came.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where's&#160;Annabeth?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Outside,&#34; I said. &#34;But there's no&#160;time to talk. Clarisse, hold still.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I uncapped Riptide and sliced off her ropes.&#160;She stood stiffly, rubbing her wrists. She glared&#160;<br/>at me&#160;for a moment, then looked&#160;at the ground and mumbled, &#34;Thanks.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're welcome,&#34; I said. &#34;Now, was&#160;anyone else on board your lifeboat?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse looked surprised. &#34;No. Just me. Everybody else aboard the Birmingham&#160;... well, I&#160;<br/>didn't even know you guys made it out.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked down, trying not to believe that my&#160;last hope of seeing Tyson alive had just been&#160;<br/>crushed. &#34;Okay. Come&#160;on, then. We&#160;have to help—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=128></a>An explosion echoed through the cave, followed by&#160;a scream&#160;that told me&#160;we might be too&#160;<br/>late. It was Annabeth crying out in fear.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>FIFTEEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>NOBODY GETS&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>THE FLEECE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I got Nobody!&#34; Polyphemus gloated.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We crept to the cave entrance and saw the Cyclops, grinning wickedly, holding up empty air.&#160;<br/>The monster shook his fist, and a baseball cap&#160;fluttered to the ground. There was Annabeth,&#160;<br/>hanging upside down by her legs.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hah!&#34; the Cyclops said. &#34;Nasty&#160;invisible girl! Already got&#160;feisty one for wife. Means you&#160;<br/>gotta be grilled with mango chutney!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth struggled, but she looked dazed. She had a nasty cut on her forehead. Her eyes were&#160;<br/>glassy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll rush him,&#34; I whispered to Clarisse. &#34;Our&#160;ship is around the back of the island. You and&#160;<br/>Grover—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No way,&#34; they said at the same&#160;time. Clarisse had armed herself with a highly collectible&#160;<br/>rams-horn spear from&#160;the Cyclops's&#160;cave. Grover had found a sheep's&#160;thigh bone, which he&#160;<br/>didn't look too happy about, but he was gripping it like a club, ready to attack.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We'll take him&#160;together,&#34; Clarisse growled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Grover said. Then he blinked, like he couldn't believe he'd&#160;just agreed with Clarisse&#160;<br/>about something.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;All right,&#34; I said. &#34;Attack plan Macedonia.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They nodded. We'd&#160;all taken the same&#160;training&#160;courses at Camp&#160;Half-Blood. They knew what&#160;<br/>I was talking about. They would sneak around either side and attack the Cyclops from&#160;the&#160;<br/>flanks while I held his attention in the front. Probably what this meant was that we'd&#160;all die&#160;<br/>instead of just me, but I was grateful for the help.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hefted my&#160;sword and shouted, &#34;Hey, Ugly!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=129></a>The giant whirled toward me. &#34;Another one?&#160;Who are you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Put down my friend. I'm the one who insulted you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You are Nobody?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's right, you smelly bucket of nose drool!&#34;&#160;It didn't sound quite as good as Annabeth's&#160;<br/>insults, but it was all I could think of. &#34;I'm&#160;Nobody and I'm&#160;proud of it! Now, put her down&#160;<br/>and get over here. I want to stab your eye out again.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;RAAAR!&#34; he bellowed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The good news: he dropped Annabeth. The bad news: he dropped her headfirst onto the rocks,&#160;<br/>where she lay motionless&#160;as a rag doll.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The other bad news: Polyphemus barreled toward me, a thousand smelly pounds of Cyclops&#160;<br/>that I would have to fight&#160;with a very small sword.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;For Pan!&#34; Grover rushed in from&#160;the right. He threw his sheep bone, which bounced&#160;<br/>harmlessly off the monster's forehead. Clarisse ran in from&#160;the left and set her spear against&#160;<br/>the ground just in time&#160;for the Cyclops to step on&#160;it. He wailed in pain, and Clarisse dove out&#160;<br/>of the way to avoid getting trampled. But the&#160;Cyclops just plucked out the shaft like a large&#160;<br/>splinter and kept advancing on me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I moved in with Riptide.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The monster made a grab for me. I rolled aside and stabbed him&#160;in the thigh.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was hoping to see him&#160;disintegrate, but this monster was much too big and powerful.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Get Annabeth!&#34; I&#160;yelled at Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He rushed over, grabbed her invisibility cap, and picked her up while Clarisse and I tried to&#160;<br/>keep Polyphemus dis-tracted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I have to admit, Clarisse was brave. She&#160;charged the Cyclops again and again. He pounded&#160;<br/>the ground, stomped at her, grabbed at her, but she was too quick. And as soon as she made&#160;<br/>an attack, I followed up by stabbing the mon-ster in the toe or the ankle or the hand.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But we couldn't keep this up forever. Eventually&#160;we would tire or the monster would get in a&#160;<br/>lucky shot. It would only take one hit to kill us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Out of the corner of my&#160;eye, I saw Grover&#160;carrying Annabeth across the rope bridge. It&#160;<br/>wouldn't have been my&#160;first choice, given the&#160;man-eating sheep on the other side, but at the&#160;<br/>moment that looked better than&#160;this side of the chasm,&#160;and it gave me&#160;an idea.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Fall back!&#34; I told Clarisse.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She rolled away as the Cyclops's&#160;fist&#160;smashed the olive tree beside her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We ran for the bridge, Polyphemus right behind us. He was cut up and hobbling from&#160;so&#160;<br/>many wounds, but all we'd&#160;done was slow him&#160;down and make him&#160;mad.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=130></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Grind you into sheep chow!&#34; he promised. &#34;A thou-sand curses on Nobody!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Faster!&#34; I told Clarisse.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We tore down the hill. The bridge was our only chance. Grover had just made it to the other&#160;<br/>side and was setting Annabeth down. We&#160;had to&#160;make it across, too, before the giant caught&#160;<br/>us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Grover!&#34; I yelled. &#34;Get Annabeth's&#160;knife!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His eyes widened when he saw the Cyclops&#160;behind us, but he nodded like he understood. As&#160;<br/>Clarisse&#160;and&#160;I scram-bled across the bridge, Grover began sawing at the ropes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The first strand went snap!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;bounded after us, making the bridge sway wildly.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The ropes were now half&#160;cut. Clarisse and I dove for solid ground, landing beside Grover. I&#160;<br/>made a wild slash with my sword and cut the remaining ropes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The bridge fell away into the chasm,&#160;and the&#160;Cyclops howled ... with delight, because he was&#160;<br/>standing right next to us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Failed!&#34; he yelled gleefully. &#34;Nobody failed!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse&#160;and&#160;Grover tried to charge him,&#160;but the mon-ster swatted them&#160;aside like flies.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My anger swelled. I couldn't believe I'd come&#160;this far, lost Tyson, suffered through so much,&#160;<br/>only to fail—stopped by a big stupid monster&#160;in a baby-blue tuxedo kilt. Nobody was going to&#160;<br/>swat down my friends like that! I mean&#160;... nobody, not Nobody. Ah, you know what I mean.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Strength coursed through&#160;my&#160;body. I raised my&#160;sword and attacked, forgetting that I was&#160;<br/>hopelessly outmatched. I jabbed the Cyclops in&#160;the belly. When he doubled over I smacked&#160;<br/>him&#160;in the nose with the hilt of&#160;my&#160;sword. I slashed and kicked and bashed until the next thing&#160;<br/>I knew, Polyphemus was sprawled on his back,&#160;dazed and groaning, and I was standing above&#160;<br/>him,&#160;the tip of my&#160;sword hover-ing over his eye.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Uhhhhhhhh,&#34; Polyphemus moaned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy!&#34; Grover gasped. &#34;How did you—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Please, noooo!&#34; the Cyclops moaned, pitifully staring up at&#160;me. His nose was bleeding. A&#160;<br/>tear welled in the cor-ner of his half-blind eye. &#34;M-m-my sheepies need me. Only trying to&#160;<br/>protect my&#160;sheep!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He began to sob.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I had won. All I had to do&#160;was stab—one quick strike.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Kill him!&#34; Clarisse&#160;yelled. &#34;What are you waiting for?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=131></a>The Cyclops sounded so heartbroken, just like ... like Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He's a Cyclops!&#34; Grover warned. &#34;Don't trust him!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew he was right. I knew Annabeth would've said the same&#160;thing.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But Polyphemus sobbed ... and for the first time it&#160;sank in that he was a son of Poseidon, too.&#160;<br/>Like Tyson. Like me. How could I&#160;just kill him&#160;in cold blood?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We only want the Fleece,&#34; I told the monster. &#34;Will you agree to let us take it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; Clarisse shouted. &#34;Kill him!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The monster sniffed. &#34;My beautiful Fleece. Prize&#160;of my&#160;collection. Take it,&#160;cruel human. Take&#160;<br/>it and go in peace.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;going to step back slowly,&#34; I told the monster. &#34;One false move ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;nodded like he understood.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stepped back ... and as fast as a cobra, Polyphemus smacked me&#160;to the edge of the cliff.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Foolish mortal!&#34; he bellowed, rising to his&#160;feet. &#34;Take my&#160;Fleece?&#160;Ha! I eat you first.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He opened his enormous mouth, and I knew that his&#160;rotten molars were the last things I would&#160;<br/>ever see.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then something went whoosh over my head and thump!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A rock the size of a basketball sailed into Polyphemus's throat—a beautiful three-pointer,&#160;<br/>nothing but net. The Cyclops choked, trying to&#160;swallow the unexpected pill. He staggered&#160;<br/>backward, but there was no place to stagger. His heel slipped,&#160;the edge of the cliff crumbled,&#160;<br/>and the great Polyphemus made chicken wing motions that did nothing to help him&#160;fly as he&#160;<br/>tumbled into the chasm.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I turned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Halfway down the path to the beach, standing com-pletely unharmed&#160;in the midst of a flock of&#160;<br/>killer sheep, was an old friend.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Bad Polyphemus,&#34; Tyson said. &#34;Not&#160;all Cyclopes as nice as we look.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson gave us the short version: Rainbow the hippocampus—who'd apparently been&#160;<br/>following us ever since the Long Island Sound,&#160;waiting for Tyson to play with him—had&#160;<br/>found Tyson sinking beneath the wreckage of the CSS Birmingham&#160;and pulled him&#160;to safety.&#160;<br/>He and Tyson had been searching the&#160;Sea of&#160;Monsters ever since, trying to find us, until&#160;<br/>Tyson caught the scent of sheep and found this island.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to hug the big oaf, except he was standing in the middle of killer sheep. &#34;Tyson,&#160;<br/>thank the gods. Annabeth is hurt!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=132></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;You thank the gods she is hurt?&#34; he asked, puzzled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No!&#34; I knelt beside Annabeth and was worried&#160;sick by what I saw. The gash on her forehead&#160;<br/>was worse than I'd realized. Her hairline was sticky with blood. Her skin was pale and&#160;<br/>clammy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover and I exchanged nervous looks. Then&#160;an idea came to me. &#34;Tyson, the Fleece. Can&#160;<br/>you get it for me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Which one?&#34; Tyson said, looking around at the hun-dreds of&#160;sheep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;In the tree!&#34; I said. &#34;The gold one!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh. Pretty. Yes.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson lumbered over, careful not to step on the&#160;sheep. If any of us had tried to approach the&#160;<br/>Fleece, we would've been eaten alive, but I&#160;guess Tyson smelled like Polyphemus, because&#160;<br/>the flock didn't&#160;bother him at all. They just&#160;cuddled up to him&#160;and bleated affectionately, as&#160;<br/>though they expected to get sheep treats from&#160;the big wicker basket. Tyson&#160;reached up and&#160;<br/>lifted the Fleece off its branch. Immediately the&#160;leaves on the oak tree turned yel-low. Tyson&#160;<br/>started wading back toward me,&#160;but I yelled, &#34;No time! Throw it!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The gold ram skin sailed through&#160;the air like a glitter-ing shag Frisbee. I caught it with a&#160;<br/>grunt. It was heavier than I'd expected—sixty or seventy pounds of precious gold wool.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I spread it over Annabeth, covering everything but&#160;her face, and prayed silently to all the gods&#160;<br/>I could think of, even the ones I didn't like.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Please. Please.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The color returned to her face. Her eyelids fluttered open. The cut on her forehead began to&#160;<br/>close. She saw Grover and said weakly, &#34;You're not... married?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover grinned. &#34;No. My friends&#160;talked me&#160;out of it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth,&#34; I said,&#160;&#34;just lay still.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But despite our protests she sat up, and I noticed that the cut on&#160;her face was almost&#160;<br/>completely healed. She looked a lot better. In fact, she shimmered with health, as if someone&#160;<br/>had injected her with glitter.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Meanwhile, Tyson was starting to have trouble with the sheep. &#34;Down!&#34; he told them&#160;as they&#160;<br/>tried to climb him,&#160;looking for&#160;food. A few were sniffing in our&#160;direction. &#34;No, sheepies. This&#160;<br/>way! Come&#160;here!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They heeded him,&#160;but it was obvious they were hungry, and they were starting to realize&#160;<br/>Tyson didn't have any treats for them. They wouldn't hold out forever with so much fresh&#160;<br/>meat nearby.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=133></a>&#34;We have to go,&#34; I said. &#34;Our ship is...&#34;&#160;The Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge was a very long way&#160;<br/>away. The shortest&#160;route was across the chasm,&#160;and we'd&#160;just destroyed the only bridge. The&#160;<br/>only other possibility was through the sheep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson,&#34; I called, &#34;can you lead the&#160;flock as far away as possible?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The sheep want food.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I know! They want people food! Just lead them&#160;away from&#160;the path. Give us time to get to&#160;<br/>the beach. Then join us there.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson looked doubtful, but he whistled. &#34;Come, sheepies! Um, people food this way!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He jogged off into the meadow, the sheep in pursuit.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Keep the Fleece around you,&#34; I told Annabeth. &#34;Just&#160;in case you're not fully healed yet. Can&#160;<br/>you stand?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She tried, but her face turned pale again. &#34;Ohh. Not fully healed.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse dropped next to her and felt&#160;her chest, which made Annabeth gasp.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ribs broken,&#34; Clarisse said. &#34;They're mending, but definitely broken.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How can you tell?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse&#160;glared at me. &#34;Because I've broken a few, runt! I'll have to carry her.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before I could argue, Clarisse picked up Annabeth like a sack of flour and lugged her down to&#160;<br/>the beach. Grover and I followed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As soon as we got to the edge of the water,&#160;I concen-trated on the&#160;Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge. I&#160;<br/>willed it to raise anchor and come&#160;to me.&#160;After a few anxious minutes, I saw the ship&#160;<br/>rounding the tip of the island.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Incoming!&#34; Tyson yelled. He was bounding down the&#160;path to join us, the sheep about fifty&#160;<br/>yards behind, bleating in frustration as their&#160;Cyclops friend ran away without feed-ing them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;They probably won't follow us into the water,&#34;&#160;I told the others. &#34;All we&#160;have to do is swim&#160;<br/>for the ship.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;With Annabeth like this?&#34; Clarisse protested.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We can do it,&#34; I insisted. I was&#160;starting to feel confi-dent again. I was back in my&#160;home&#160;<br/>turf—the sea. &#34;Once we get&#160;to the ship, we're home free.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We almost made it, too.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were just wading past the entrance to the ravine, when we heard a tremendous roar and&#160;<br/>saw Polyphemus, scraped up and bruised but still very much alive, his baby-blue wedding&#160;<br/>outfit in tatters, splashing toward&#160;us with a boulder in each hand.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=134></a>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>SIXTEEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I GO DOWN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WITH THE SHIP&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You'd think he'd&#160;run out of rocks,&#34; I muttered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Swim&#160;for it!&#34; Grover said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He and Clarisse plunged into the surf. Annabeth&#160;hung on to Clarisse's&#160;neck and tried to paddle&#160;<br/>with one hand, the wet Fleece weighing her down.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But the monster's attention wasn't&#160;on the Fleece.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You, young Cyclops!&#34; Polyphemus&#160;roared. &#34;Traitor to your kind!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson froze.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Don't listen to him!&#34; I pleaded. &#34;Come on.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I pulled Tyson's arm,&#160;but I might as well have&#160;been pulling a mountain.&#160;He turned and faced&#160;<br/>the older Cyclops. &#34;I am&#160;not a traitor.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You serve mortals!&#34; Polyphemus shouted. &#34;Thieving humans!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;threw his first boulder. Tyson swatted it aside with his fist.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not a traitor,&#34; Tyson said. &#34;And you are not my&#160;kind.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Death or victory!&#34; Polyphemus charged into&#160;the surf, but his foot&#160;was still wounded. He&#160;<br/>immediately stumbled and fell on his face. That&#160;would've been funny, except he started&#160;to get&#160;<br/>up again, spitting salt water and growling.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy!&#34; Clarisse yelled. &#34;Come on!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They were almost to the ship with the Fleece.&#160;If I could just&#160;keep the monster distracted a&#160;<br/>little longer ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go,&#34; Tyson told me. &#34;I will hold Big Ugly.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=135></a>&#34;No! He'll kill you.&#34; I'd already lost&#160;Tyson once.&#160;I wasn't&#160;going to lose him again. &#34;We'll fight&#160;<br/>him&#160;together.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Together,&#34; Tyson agreed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I drew my&#160;sword.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;advanced carefully, limping worse than ever. But there was nothing wrong with&#160;<br/>his throwing arm.&#160;He chucked his second boulder.&#160;I dove to one side, but I still would've been&#160;<br/>squashed if Tyson's fist hadn't blasted the rock to rubble.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I willed the sea to rise. A twenty-foot wave surged&#160;up, lifting me&#160;on its crest. I rode toward&#160;<br/>the Cyclops and kicked him&#160;in the eye, leaping&#160;over his head as the water blasted him&#160;onto the&#160;<br/>beach.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Destroy you!&#34; Polyphemus spluttered. &#34;Fleece stealer!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You stole the Fleece!&#34; I yelled. &#34;You've been&#160;using it to lure satyrs to their deaths!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;So?&#160;Satyrs good eating!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Fleece should be used to heal! It&#160;belongs to the children of the gods!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I am&#160;a child of the gods!&#34; Polyphemus swiped&#160;at me, but I sidestepped. &#34;Father Poseidon,&#160;<br/>curse this thief!&#34; He was blinking hard now, like&#160;he could barely see,&#160;and I realized he was&#160;<br/>targeting by the sound of my&#160;voice.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Poseidon won't curse me,&#34; I said, backing up as&#160;the Cyclops grabbed air. &#34;I'm&#160;his son, too.&#160;<br/>He won't play favorites.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;roared. He ripped an olive tree out&#160;of the side of the cliff and smashed it where&#160;<br/>I'd been standing a moment before. &#34;Humans not the same! Nasty, tricky, lying!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover was helping Annabeth aboard the ship. Clarisse was waving frantically at me, telling&#160;<br/>me&#160;to come&#160;on.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson worked his way around Polyphemus, trying to get behind him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Young one!&#34; the older Cyclops called. &#34;Where are you?&#160;Help me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson stopped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You weren't raised right!&#34; Polyphemus wailed,&#160;shaking his olive tree&#160;club. &#34;Poor orphaned&#160;<br/>brother! Help me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No one moved. No sound but the ocean and my&#160;own heartbeat. Then Tyson stepped forward,&#160;<br/>raising his hands defensively. &#34;Don't fight, Cyclops brother. Put down the—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;spun toward his voice.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I shouted.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=136></a>The tree struck him&#160;with such force it would've&#160;flat-tened me&#160;into a Percy pizza with extra&#160;<br/>olives. Tyson flew backward, plowing a trench&#160;in the sand. Polyphemus charged after him,&#160;<br/>but I shouted, &#34;No!&#34; and lunged as far as I could with Riptide. I'd hoped to sting Polyphemus&#160;<br/>in the back of the thigh, but I managed to leap a little bit higher.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Blaaaaah!&#34; Polyphemus&#160;bleated just like his sheep, and swung at me&#160;with his tree.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I dove, but still got raked across the back by a dozen jagged&#160;branches. I was bleeding and&#160;<br/>bruised and exhausted. The guinea pig inside me&#160;wanted to bolt. But I swallowed down my&#160;<br/>fear.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;swung the tree again, but this time I&#160;was ready. I grabbed a branch as it passed,&#160;<br/>ignoring the pain in my&#160;hands as I was jerked skyward, and let the Cyclops&#160;lift me&#160;into the air.&#160;<br/>At the top of&#160;the arc I let go and fell straight&#160;against the giant's&#160;face—landing with both&#160;feet&#160;<br/>on his already damaged eye.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Polyphemus yowled in pain. Tyson tackled him,&#160;pulling him&#160;down. I landed next to them—<br/>sword in hand, within striking distance of the monster's heart. But I locked eyes with Tyson,&#160;<br/>and I knew I couldn't do it. It just wasn't&#160;right.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Let him&#160;go,&#34; I told Tyson. &#34;Run.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>With one last mighty effort, Tyson pushed the&#160;cursing older Cyclops away, and we ran for the&#160;<br/>surf.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I will smash you.'&#34; Polyphemus yelled, doubling&#160;over in pain. His enormous hands cupped&#160;<br/>over his eye.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson and I plunged into the waves.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Polyphemus screamed. He picked up his tree club and threw it into the&#160;<br/>water. It splashed off to our right.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I summoned up a current to carry us, and we started gaining speed. I&#160;was beginning to think&#160;<br/>we might make it to the ship, when Clarisse&#160;shouted from&#160;the deck, &#34;Yeah, Jackson! In your&#160;<br/>face, Cyclops!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Shut up, I wanted to yell.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Rarrr!&#34; Polyphemus picked up a boulder. He threw it toward the sound of Clarisse's&#160;voice,&#160;<br/>but it fell short, nar-rowly missing Tyson and me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, yeah!&#34; Clarisse taunted. &#34;You throw&#160;like a wimp! Teach you to try marrying me, you&#160;<br/>idiot!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Clarisse!&#34; I yelled, unable&#160;to stand it. &#34;Shut up!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Too late. Polyphemus threw another boulder, and this time&#160;I watched helplessly as it sailed&#160;<br/>over my&#160;head and crashed through the&#160;hull of the Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>You wouldn't believe how fast a ship can&#160;sink. The Queen Anne's&#160;Revenge creaked and&#160;<br/>groaned and listed forward like it was going down a playground slide.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=137></a>&#160;<br/>I cursed, willing the sea to push us faster,&#160;but the ship's&#160;masts were already going under.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Dive!&#34; I told Tyson. And as&#160;another rock sailed over our&#160;heads, we plunged underwater.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My friends were sinking fast, trying to swim, without luck, in the bubbly trail of the ship's&#160;<br/>wreckage.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Not many people realize that when a ship goes down, it acts like a&#160;sinkhole, pulling down&#160;<br/>everything around it. Clarisse&#160;was a strong swimmer, but even she wasn't&#160;making any&#160;<br/>progress. Grover frantically kicked with his&#160;hooves. Annabeth was hanging on to the Fleece,&#160;<br/>which flashed in the water like a wave of new pennies.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I swam&#160;toward them, knowing that I might not&#160;have the strength to pull my friends out.&#160;<br/>Worse, pieces of timber were swirling around them; none of my power with water would help&#160;<br/>if I got whacked on the head by a beam.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We need help, I thought.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Yes. Tyson's voice, loud&#160;and clear in my&#160;head.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked over at him,&#160;startled. I'd heard Nereids and other water spirits speak to me&#160;<br/>underwater before, but it never occurred to&#160;me&#160;... Tyson was a son of Poseidon. We&#160;could&#160;<br/>communicate with each other.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Rainbow, Tyson said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded, then closed my&#160;eyes and concentrated, adding my&#160;voice to Tyson's: RAINBOW!&#160;<br/>We need you!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Immediately, shapes shimmered in the darkness below—three horses with fish tails, galloping&#160;<br/>upward faster than dolphins. Rainbow and his friends glanced in our direction and seemed to&#160;<br/>read our thoughts. They whisked into the wreckage, and a moment later burst upward in a&#160;<br/>cloud of bubbles—Grover, Annabeth,&#160;and Clarisse each clinging to the neck of a&#160;<br/>hippocampus.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Rainbow, the largest, had Clarisse. He raced over&#160;to us and allowed Tyson to grab hold of his&#160;<br/>mane. His friend who bore Annabeth did the same for me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We broke the surface of the water and raced&#160;away from&#160;Polyphemus's island. Behind us, I&#160;<br/>could hear the Cyclops roaring in triumph, &#34;I did it! I&#160;finally sank Nobody!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hoped he never found out he was wrong.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We skimmed across the sea as the island&#160;shrank to a dot and then disappeared.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Did it,&#34; Annabeth muttered in exhaustion. &#34;We ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She slumped against the neck of the&#160;hippocampus and instantly fell asleep.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=138></a>I didn't know how far the hippocampi could take&#160;us. I didn't know where we were going. I just&#160;<br/>propped up Annabeth so&#160;she wouldn't fall off, covered her in the Golden Fleece that we'd&#160;<br/>been through so much to&#160;get, and&#160;said a silent prayer of thanks.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Which reminded me&#160;... I&#160;still owed the gods a debt.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're a genius,&#34; I told Annabeth quietly.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I put my head against the Fleece,&#160;and before I knew it, I was asleep, too.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>SEVENTEEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>WE GET A SURPRISE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>ON MIAMI BEACH&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, wake up.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Salt water splashed my&#160;face. Annabeth was shaking my&#160;shoulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In the distance, the sun was setting behind a city skyline. I could see a beachside&#160;highway&#160;<br/>lined with palm&#160;trees, store-fronts glowing with red and blue neon, a harbor filled with&#160;<br/>sailboats and cruise ships.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Miami, I think,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;But the hippocampi are acting funny.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Sure enough, our fishy friends had slowed&#160;down and were whinnying and swimming in&#160;<br/>circles, sniffing the water. They didn't look&#160;happy. One of them sneezed. I could tell what&#160;<br/>they were thinking.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;This is as far as they'll take us,&#34; I said. &#34;Too many humans. Too much pollution. We'll have&#160;<br/>to swim&#160;to shore on our own.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>None of us was very psyched about that, but we&#160;thanked Rainbow and his friends for the ride.&#160;<br/>Tyson cried a little. He unfastened the makeshift saddle pack he'd&#160;made, which contained his&#160;<br/>tool kit and a couple of other things he'd&#160;salvaged from&#160;the Birmingham&#160;wreck. He hugged&#160;<br/>Rainbow around the neck, gave him&#160;a soggy mango he'd&#160;picked up on the island, and said&#160;<br/>good-bye.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Once the hippocampi's&#160;white manes disappeared into the sea, we swam&#160;for shore. The waves&#160;<br/>pushed us forward, and in no time we were back in the mortal world. We&#160;wandered along the&#160;<br/>cruise line docks, pushing&#160;through crowds of&#160;people arriving for vacations. Porters bustled&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=139></a>around with carts of luggage. Taxi drivers yelled&#160;at each other in Spanish and tried to cut in&#160;<br/>line for customers. If anybody noticed us—five kids dripping wet and looking like they'd&#160;just&#160;<br/>had a fight with a monster—they didn't let on.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Now that we were back among mortals, Tyson's single eye had blurred from the Mist. Grover&#160;<br/>had put on his cap and sneakers. Even the Fleece had transformed&#160;from&#160;a sheepskin to&#160;a red-<br/>and-gold high school letter jacket with&#160;a large glittery Omega on the pocket.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth ran to the nearest newspaper box and checked the date on the Miami Herald. She&#160;<br/>cursed. &#34;June eighteenth! We've been away from camp ten days!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's impossible!&#34; Clarisse said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But I knew it wasn't. Time&#160;traveled differently in mon-strous&#160;places.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thalia's tree must be almost dead,&#34; Grover wailed. &#34;We have to get the Fleece back tonight.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse slumped down on the pavement. &#34;How&#160;are we supposed to do that?&#34;&#160;Her voice&#160;<br/>trembled. &#34;We're hundreds of miles away. No money. No ride. This is just like the Oracle&#160;<br/>said. It's&#160;your fault, Jackson! If you hadn't interfered—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy's&#160;fault?!&#34; Annabeth exploded. &#34;Clarisse, how can you say that?&#160;You are the biggest—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Stop it!&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse put her head in&#160;hands. Annabeth stomped her foot in frustration.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The thing was: I'd almost forgotten this quest&#160;was sup-posed to be Clarisse's. For a scary&#160;<br/>moment, I saw things from&#160;her point of view. How would I feel if a bunch of other heroes had&#160;<br/>butted in and made me&#160;look bad?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I thought about what I'd overheard in the boiler room&#160;of the CSS Birmingham—Ares yelling&#160;<br/>at Clarisse, warning her that she'd better not fail. Ares couldn't&#160;care less about the camp, but if&#160;<br/>Clarisse made him&#160;look bad ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Clarisse,&#34; I said, &#34;what did the Oracle tell you exactly?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She looked up. I thought she was going to tell me&#160;off, but instead she took a deep breath and&#160;<br/>recited her prophecy:&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You shall sail the iron ship with warriors of bone,&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>You shall find what you seek and make it your own,&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But despair for your life entombed within stone,&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And fail without friends, to fly home alone.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=140></a>&#34;Ouch,&#34; Grover mumbled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; I said. &#34;No ... wait a minute. I've got it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I searched my pockets for money, and found&#160;nothing but a golden drachma. &#34;Does anybody&#160;<br/>have any cash?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and Grover shook their&#160;heads morosely. Clarisse pulled a wet Confederate dollar&#160;<br/>from&#160;her pocket and sighed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Cash?&#34; Tyson asked hesitantly. &#34;Like ... green paper?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked at him.&#160;&#34;Yeah.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Like the kind in duffel bags?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, but we lost those bags days a-g-g—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stuttered to a halt as&#160;Tyson rummaged in his saddle pack and pulled out the Ziploc bag full&#160;<br/>of cash that Hermes had&#160;included in our supplies.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I said. &#34;How did you—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thought it was a feed bag for Rainbow,&#34; he&#160;said. &#34;Found it floating in sea, but only paper&#160;<br/>inside. Sorry.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He handed me&#160;the cash. Fives and tens, at least three hundred dollars.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I ran to the curb and grabbed a taxi that was just letting out a family of cruise passengers.&#160;<br/>&#34;Clarisse,&#34; I yelled. &#34;Come on.&#160;You're going to the airport. Annabeth, give&#160;her the Fleece.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'm&#160;not sure which of them looked more stunned as I took the Fleece&#160;letter jacket from&#160;<br/>Annabeth, tucked the cash into its pocket, and put it in Clarisse's&#160;arms.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Clarisse said, &#34;You'd let me—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's your quest,&#34; I said. &#34;We only have enough money for one flight. Besides, I can't&#160;travel by&#160;<br/>air. Zeus would blast me&#160;into a million pieces. That's&#160;what the prophecy meant: you'd fail&#160;<br/>without friends, meaning you'd need our help, but you'd have to fly home alone. You have to&#160;<br/>get the Fleece back safely.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I could see her mind working—suspicious at first,&#160;won-dering what trick I was playing, then&#160;<br/>finally deciding I meant what I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She jumped in the cab. &#34;You can count on me. I won't fail.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not failing would be good.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The cab peeled out in a cloud of exhaust. The Fleece was on its way.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;that was so—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=141></a>&#34;Generous?&#34; Grover offered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Insane,&#34; Annabeth corrected. &#34;You're betting the lives of&#160;everybody at camp&#160;that Clarisse&#160;<br/>will get the Fleece safely back by tonight?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's her quest,&#34; I said. &#34;She deserves a chance.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy is nice,&#34; Tyson said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy is too nice,&#34; Annabeth grumbled, but I&#160;couldn't help thinking that maybe, just maybe,&#160;<br/>she was a little impressed. I'd surprised her, anyway. And that wasn't&#160;easy to do.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come on,&#34; I told my&#160;friends. &#34;Let's&#160;find another way home.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's&#160;when I turned and found&#160;a sword's point at my throat.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey, cuz,&#34; said Luke. &#34;Welcome&#160;back to the States.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His bear-man thugs appeared on either of side of us. One grabbed Annabeth and Grover by&#160;<br/>their T-shirt collars. The other tried to grab&#160;Tyson, but Tyson knocked him into a pile of&#160;<br/>luggage and roared at Luke.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; Luke said calmly, &#34;tell your giant to back down or I'll&#160;have Oreius bash your friends'&#160;<br/>heads together.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Oreius grinned and raised Annabeth and&#160;Grover off the ground, kicking and screaming.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you want, Luke?&#34; I growled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He smiled, the scar rippling on the side of his face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He gestured toward the end of the dock, and I noticed what should've been obvious. The&#160;<br/>biggest boat in port was&#160;the Princess Andromeda.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Why, Percy,&#34; Luke said, &#34;I want to&#160;extend my&#160;hospital-ity, of course.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The bear twins herded us aboard the Princess Andromeda. They threw us down on the aft&#160;<br/>deck in front of a swimming pool with sparkling&#160;fountains that sprayed into the air. A dozen&#160;<br/>of Luke's&#160;assorted goons—snake people, Laistrygonians, demigods in battle armor—had&#160;<br/>gathered to watch us get some&#160;&#34;hospitality.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And so, the Fleece,&#34; Luke mused. &#34;Where is it?&#34;&#160;He looked us over, prodding my&#160;shirt with&#160;<br/>the tip of his sword, poking Grover's jeans.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey!&#34; Grover yelled. &#34;That's real goat fur under there!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sorry, old friend.&#34; Luke&#160;smiled. &#34;Just give me&#160;the Fleece and&#160;I'll leave you to return to your,&#160;<br/>ah, little nature quest.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Blaa-ha-ha!&#34; Grover protested. &#34;Some old friend!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=142></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;Maybe you didn't hear me.&#34; Luke's&#160;voice was danger-ously calm. &#34;Where—is—the—<br/>Fleece?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not here,&#34; I said. I probably&#160;shouldn't&#160;have told him&#160;anything, but it felt good to throw the&#160;<br/>truth in his face. &#34;We sent it&#160;on ahead of us. You messed up.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke's&#160;eyes narrowed. &#34;You're lying. You couldn't have ...&#34; His face reddened as a horrible&#160;<br/>possibility occurred&#160;to him. &#34;Clarisse?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I nodded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You trusted ... you gave ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Agrius!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The bear giant flinched. &#34;Y-yes?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Get below and prepare my steed. Bring it to the deck. I need&#160;to fly to the Miami Airport,&#160;<br/>fast.'&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But, boss—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Do it!&#34; Luke screamed. &#34;Or&#160;I'll feed you to the drakon!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The bear-man gulped and lumbered down the stairs. Luke paced in front of the swimming&#160;<br/>pool, cursing in Ancient Greek, gripping his&#160;sword so tight his knuckles turned white.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The rest of Luke's&#160;crew looked uneasy. Maybe&#160;they'd&#160;never seen their boss so unhinged&#160;<br/>before.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I started thinking ... If I could use Luke's&#160;anger, get him&#160;to talk so everybody could hear how&#160;<br/>crazy his plans were ...&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked at the swimming pool, at the fountains&#160;spray-ing mist into the air, making a rainbow&#160;<br/>in the sunset. And suddenly I had an idea.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You've been toying with us all along,&#34; I said. &#34;You wanted us to bring you the Fleece and&#160;<br/>save you the trouble of getting it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke scowled. &#34;Of course, you idiot!&#160;And you've messed everything up!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Traitor!&#34; I dug my&#160;last gold drachma&#160;out of my&#160;pocket and threw it at Luke. As I expected,&#160;<br/>he dodged it easily.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The coin sailed into the spray of rainbow-colored water.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I hoped my&#160;prayer would be accepted in silence. I thought with all my&#160;heart: O goddess,&#160;<br/>accept my&#160;offering.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=143></a>&#34;You tricked all of us!&#34; I yelled at Luke. &#34;Even DIONYSUS at&#160;CAMP HALF-BLOOD!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Behind Luke, the fountain began to shimmer, but&#160;I needed everyone's&#160;attention on me, so I&#160;<br/>uncapped Riptide.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke just sneered. &#34;This is no time for heroics,&#160;Percy. Drop your puny little sword, or I'll have&#160;<br/>you killed sooner rather than later.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Who poisoned Thalia's&#160;tree, Luke?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I did, of course,&#34; he snarled. &#34;I already told you that. I used elder python venom, straight&#160;<br/>from&#160;the depths of Tartarus.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Chiron had nothing to do with it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ha! You know he would never do that. The old fool wouldn't have the guts.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You call it guts?&#160;Betraying your friends?&#160;Endangering the whole camp?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke raised his sword. &#34;You don't understand the half of it.&#160;I was going to let you take the&#160;<br/>Fleece ... once I was done with it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That made me&#160;hesitate. Why would he let me&#160;take the Fleece? He must've been lying. But I&#160;<br/>couldn't afford to lose his attention.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You were going to heal Kronos,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes! The Fleece's magic would've sped his mending process by tenfold. But you haven't&#160;<br/>stopped us, Percy. You've only slowed us down a little.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And so you poisoned the tree, you betrayed Thalia, you set us up—all to help Kronos destroy&#160;<br/>the gods.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke gritted his teeth. &#34;You know that! Why do you keep asking me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Because I want everybody in the audience to hear you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What audience?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then his eyes narrowed. He looked behind him&#160;and his goons did the same. They gasped and&#160;<br/>stumbled back.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Above the pool, shimmering in the rainbow mist, was an Iris-message vision of Dionysus,&#160;<br/>Tantalus, and the whole camp in the dining pavilion. They sat in stunned silence, watching us.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well,&#34; said Dionysus dryly, &#34;some unplanned dinner entertainment.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Mr. D, you heard him,&#34; I said. &#34;You all heard Luke. The poisoning of the tree wasn't&#160;<br/>Chiron's fault.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Mr. D sighed. &#34;I suppose not.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=144></a>&#34;The Iris-message could be a trick,&#34; Tantalus&#160;suggested, but his attention was mostly on his&#160;<br/>cheeseburger, which he was trying to corner with both hands.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I fear not,&#34; Mr. D said, looking with distaste at Tantalus. &#34;It appears I shall have to reinstate&#160;<br/>Chiron as activities director. I suppose&#160;I do miss the old horse's&#160;pinochle games.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus grabbed the cheeseburger. It didn't bolt away from&#160;him. He lifted it from&#160;the plate&#160;<br/>and stared at it in amazement, as if it were the largest diamond in the world. &#34;I got it!&#34; he&#160;<br/>cackled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We are no longer in need of your services, Tantalus,&#34; Mr. D announced.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tantalus looked stunned. &#34;What?&#160;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You may return to the Underworld. You are dis-missed.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No! But—Nooooooooooo!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As he dissolved into mist, his fingers clutched&#160;at the cheeseburger, trying to bring it to his&#160;<br/>mouth. But it was too late. He disappeared and&#160;the cheeseburger fell back&#160;onto its plate. The&#160;<br/>campers exploded into cheering.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke bellowed with rage. He slashed his sword through the fountain and the Iris-message&#160;<br/>dissolved, but the deed was done.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was feeling pretty good about myself, until&#160;Luke turned and gave me&#160;a murderous look.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Kronos was right, Percy. You're an unreliable weapon. You need to be replaced.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wasn't&#160;sure what he meant, but I didn't&#160;have&#160;time to think about it.&#160;One of his men blew a&#160;<br/>brass whistle, and the deck doors flew open. A dozen more warriors poured out, making a&#160;<br/>circle around us, the brass tips of their spears bris-tling.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke smiled at me. &#34;You'll never leave this boat alive.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>EIGHTEEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>THE PARTY PONIES&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>INVADE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;One on one,&#34; I challenged Luke. &#34;What are you afraid of?&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=145></a>&#160;<br/>Luke curled his lip. The soldiers&#160;who were about to kill us hesitated, waiting for his order.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Before he could say anything, Agrius, the bear-man, burst onto the deck leading a flying&#160;<br/>horse. It was the first pure-black pegasus I'd&#160;ever seen, with wings like a giant raven. The&#160;<br/>pegasus mare bucked and whinnied. I could&#160;understand her thoughts. She was calling Agrius&#160;<br/>and Luke some&#160;names so&#160;bad Chiron would've washed her muzzle out with saddle soap.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sir!&#34; Agrius called, dodging a pegasus hoof. &#34;Your steed is ready!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke kept his eyes on me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I told you last summer, Percy,&#34; he said. &#34;You can't bait me&#160;into a fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And you keep avoiding one,&#34; I noticed. &#34;Scared&#160;your warriors will see you get whipped?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke glanced at his men, and he saw I'd trapped him.&#160;If he backed down now, he would look&#160;<br/>weak. If he fought me, he'd&#160;lose valuable time&#160;chasing after Clarisse. For my part, the best I&#160;<br/>could hope for was to distract him,&#160;giving my&#160;friends a chance to escape. If anybody could&#160;<br/>think of a plan to get them out of there,&#160;Annabeth could. On the down-side, I knew how good&#160;<br/>Luke was at sword-fighting.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'll kill you quickly,&#34; he decided, and raised his weapon. Backbiter was a foot longer than my&#160;<br/>own sword. Its blade glinted with an evil gray-and-gold light where the&#160;human steel had been&#160;<br/>melded with celestial bronze. I could almost feel the blade fighting against itself, like two&#160;<br/>opposing mag-nets bound together. I didn't know how&#160;the blade had been made, but I sensed a&#160;<br/>tragedy. Someone had died in the process. Luke&#160;whistled to one of his men, who threw him&#160;a&#160;<br/>round leather-and-bronze shield.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He grinned at me&#160;wickedly.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Luke,&#34; Annabeth said, &#34;at least give him&#160;a shield.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sorry, Annabeth,&#34; he said. &#34;You bring&#160;your own equip-ment to this party.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The shield was a problem. Fighting two-handed&#160;with just a sword gives you more power, but&#160;<br/>fighting one-handed with a shield gives you better defense and versatility. There are more&#160;<br/>moves, more options, more ways to kill. I thought back to Chiron, who'd told me&#160;to stay at&#160;<br/>camp no matter what, and learn to fight. Now I&#160;was going to pay for not lis-tening to him.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke lunged and almost killed me&#160;on the first try. His sword went under my arm,&#160;slashing&#160;<br/>through my&#160;shirt and grazing my&#160;ribs.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I jumped back, then counterattacked&#160;with Riptide, but Luke slammed my blade away with his&#160;<br/>shield.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;My, Percy,&#34; Luke chided.&#160;&#34;You're out of practice.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He came at me&#160;again with a swipe to&#160;the head. I parried, returned&#160;with a thrust. He&#160;<br/>sidestepped easily.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=146></a>The cut on my ribs stung. My heart was racing.&#160;When Luke lunged again, I jumped backward&#160;<br/>into the swimming pool and felt a surge of strength. I spun underwater, creat-ing a funnel&#160;<br/>cloud, and blasted out of the deep end, straight at Luke's&#160;face.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The force of the water knocked&#160;him&#160;down, spluttering and blinded. But before I could strike,&#160;<br/>he rolled aside and was on his feet again.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I attacked and sliced off the edge of his shield, but that didn't even faze him. He dropped to a&#160;<br/>crouch and jabbed at my&#160;legs. Suddenly my&#160;thigh was on fire, with a pain so intense I&#160;<br/>collapsed. My jeans were ripped above the knee. I was hurt. I didn't know how badly. Luke&#160;<br/>hacked downward and I rolled behind a deck chair. I tried to stand, but my&#160;leg wouldn't&#160;take&#160;<br/>the weight.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Perrrrrcy!&#34; Grover bleated.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I rolled again as Luke's&#160;sword slashed the&#160;deck chair in half, metal pipes and all.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I clawed toward the swimming pool, trying hard&#160;not to black out. I'd never make it. Luke&#160;<br/>knew it, too. He advanced slowly, smiling. The edge of his sword&#160;was tinged with red.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;One thing I want you to watch before you die,&#160;Percy.&#34; He looked at the bear-man Oreius,&#160;<br/>who was still holding Annabeth and Grover by the necks. &#34;You can eat your din-ner now,&#160;<br/>Oreius. Bon appetit.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He-he! He-he!&#34; The bear-man lifted my&#160;friends and bared his teeth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's&#160;when all Hades broke loose.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Whish!&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A red-feathered arrow sprouted from&#160;Oreius's&#160;mouth. With a surprised look&#160;on his hairy face,&#160;<br/>he crumpled to the deck.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Brother!&#34; Agrius wailed. He&#160;let the pegasus's reins go slack&#160;just long enough for the black&#160;<br/>steed to kick&#160;him&#160;in the head&#160;and fly away free over Miami Bay.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>For a split second, Luke's&#160;guards were too stunned to do anything except watch the bear&#160;<br/>twins'&#160;bodies dissolve into smoke.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then there was a wild chorus of war cries and hooves thundering against metal. A dozen&#160;<br/>centaurs charged out of the main stairwell.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ponies!&#34; Tyson cried with delight.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My mind had trouble processing everything I&#160;saw. Chiron was among the crowd, but his&#160;<br/>relatives were almost nothing like him. There were centaurs with black Arabian stallion&#160;<br/>bodies, others with gold palomino coats, others&#160;with orange-and-white spots like paint horses.&#160;<br/>Some&#160;wore brightly colored T-shirts with&#160;Day-Glo letters that said PARTY PONIES:&#160;<br/>SOUTH FLORIDA CHAPTER. Some&#160;were armed with bows, some&#160;with baseball bats, some&#160;<br/>with paintball guns. One had&#160;his face painted like a Comanche warrior and&#160;was waving a&#160;<br/>large orange Styrofoam&#160;hand making a big Number I. Another was bare-chested and painted&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=147></a>entirely green. A third had googly-eye glasses with the eyeballs bouncing around on Slinky&#160;<br/>coils, and one of those baseball caps with soda-can-and-straw attachments on either side.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They exploded onto the deck with&#160;such ferocity and color that&#160;for a moment even Luke&#160;was&#160;<br/>stunned. I couldn't tell whether they had come&#160;to celebrate or attack.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Apparently both. As Luke was raising his sword&#160;to rally his troops, a centaur shot a custom-<br/>made arrow with a leather boxing glove on the end. It smacked Luke in the face and sent him&#160;<br/>crashing into the swimming pool.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His warriors scattered. I couldn't&#160;blame them. Facing the hooves of a rearing stallion is scary&#160;<br/>enough, but when it's a centaur, armed with a bow and whooping it up in&#160;a soda-drinking hat,&#160;<br/>even the bravest warrior would retreat.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come get some!&#34; yelled one of the party ponies.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>They let loose with their&#160;paintball guns. A wave of blue and yellow exploded against Luke's&#160;<br/>warriors, blinding them&#160;and splattering them&#160;from head to toe. They tried to run, only to slip&#160;<br/>and fall.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron galloped toward Annabeth and Grover,&#160;neatly plucked them&#160;off the deck, and&#160;<br/>deposited them&#160;on his back.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to get up, but my&#160;wounded leg still felt like it was on fire.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Luke was crawling out of the pool.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Attack, you fools.'&#34;&#160;he ordered his troops.&#160;Somewhere down below deck, a large alarm bell&#160;<br/>thrummed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew any second we would be swamped by Luke's&#160;reinforcements. Already, his warriors&#160;<br/>were getting over their surprise, coming at&#160;the centaurs with swords and spears drawn.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson slapped half a dozen of them&#160;aside,&#160;knocking them&#160;over the guardrail into Miami Bay.&#160;<br/>But more warriors were coming up the stairs.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Withdraw, brethren!&#34; Chiron said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You won't get away with this, horse man!&#34;&#160;Luke shouted. He raised his sword, but got&#160;<br/>smacked in the face with&#160;another boxing glove arrow, and sat down hard in a deck chair.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A palomino centaur hoisted me&#160;onto his back. &#34;Dude, get your big friend!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson!&#34; I yelled. &#34;Come on!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson dropped the two warriors he was about to&#160;tie into a knot and jogged after us. He&#160;<br/>jumped on the centaur's&#160;back.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Dude!&#34; the centaur groaned, almost buckling under Tyson's weight. &#34;Do the words 'low-carb&#160;<br/>diet'&#160;mean any-thing to you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=148></a>Luke's&#160;warriors were organizing themselves into a pha-lanx. But by the time they were ready&#160;<br/>to advance, the cen-taurs had galloped to the&#160;edge of the deck and fearlessly jumped the&#160;<br/>guardrail, as if it were&#160;a steeplechase and not ten stories above the ground. I was sure we were&#160;<br/>going to die. We&#160;plummeted toward the docks, but the centaurs hit the asphalt with hardly a&#160;<br/>jolt and galloped off, whooping and&#160;yelling taunts at the Princess&#160;Andromeda as we raced into&#160;<br/>the streets of downtown Miami.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I have no idea what the Miamians thought as we galloped by.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Streets and buildings began to blur&#160;as the centaurs picked up speed. It felt as if space were&#160;<br/>compacting—as if each centaur&#160;step took us miles and miles. In no time, we'd&#160;left the city&#160;<br/>behind. We&#160;raced through marshy fields of&#160;high grass and ponds and stunted trees.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Finally, we found ourselves in a trailer park at the edge of a lake. The trailers were all horse&#160;<br/>trailers, tricked out with televisions and mini-refrigerators&#160;and mosquito netting. We&#160;were in a&#160;<br/>centaur&#160;camp.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Dude!&#34; said a party pony as he unloaded his gear. &#34;Did you see that bear guy?&#160;He was all&#160;<br/>like: 'Whoa, I have an arrow in my&#160;mouth!'&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The centaur with the googly-eye glasses laughed. &#34;That was awesome! Head slam!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The two centaurs charged at each other full-force and knocked&#160;heads, then went staggering&#160;<br/>off in different direc-tions&#160;with crazy grins on their faces.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron sighed. He set Annabeth and Grover down&#160;on a picnic blanket next to me. &#34;I really&#160;<br/>wish my&#160;cousins wouldn't slam&#160;their heads together. They don't&#160;have the brain cells to spare.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Chiron,&#34; I said, still stunned by the fact that he&#160;was here. &#34;You saved us.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He gave me&#160;a dry smile. &#34;Well now, I couldn't very well let you die, especially since you've&#160;<br/>cleared my&#160;name.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But how did you know where we were?&#34;&#160;Annabeth asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Advanced planning, my&#160;dear. I figured you would wash up near Miami if you made it out of&#160;<br/>the Sea of Monsters alive. Almost everything strange washes up near Miami.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Gee, thanks,&#34; Grover mumbled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, no,&#34; Chiron said. &#34;I didn't mean&#160;... Oh, never mind. I am glad to see you, my&#160;young&#160;<br/>satyr. The point is, I was&#160;able to eavesdrop on&#160;Percy's Iris-message and trace the signal. Iris&#160;<br/>and I have been friends for centuries. I asked her to alert me&#160;to any important communications&#160;<br/>in this area. It then took no effort to convince my&#160;cousins to&#160;ride to your aid. As you see,&#160;<br/>centaurs can&#160;travel quite fast when we wish to. Distance for us is not the same&#160;as distance for&#160;<br/>humans.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I looked over at the campfire, where three party ponies were teaching Tyson to operate a&#160;<br/>paintball gun. I hoped they knew what they were getting into.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=149></a>&#34;So what now?&#34;&#160;I asked Chiron. &#34;We&#160;just let Luke sail away? He's&#160;got Kronos aboard that&#160;<br/>ship. Or parts of him,&#160;anyway.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron knelt, carefully folding his front legs&#160;under-neath him.&#160;He opened the medicine pouch&#160;<br/>on his belt and started to treat my&#160;wounds. &#34;I'm&#160;afraid, Percy, that today has been something&#160;<br/>of a draw. We didn't have the strength of numbers to take that ship. Luke was not organized&#160;<br/>enough to pursue us. Nobody won.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But we got the Fleece!&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Clarisse is on her way back to camp with it right&#160;<br/>now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron nodded, though he still looked uneasy. &#34;You are&#160;all true heroes. And as soon as we get&#160;<br/>Percy fixed up, you must return to Half-Blood Hill. The centaurs shall carry you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're coming, too?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh yes, Percy. I'll be relieved to get home. My&#160;brethren here simply do not appreciate Dean&#160;<br/>Martin's&#160;music. Besides,&#160;I must have some&#160;words with Mr. D.&#160;There's the rest of the summer&#160;<br/>to plan. So much training&#160;to do. And I want to see ... I'm&#160;curious about the Fleece.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't know exactly what he meant, but it made&#160;me&#160;worried about what Luke had said: I was&#160;<br/>going to let you take the Fleece ... once I was done with it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Had he just been lying? I'd learned with Kronos&#160;there was usually a plan within a plan. The&#160;<br/>titan lord wasn't&#160;called the Crooked One for&#160;nothing. He had ways of getting peo-ple to do&#160;<br/>what he wanted without them&#160;ever&#160;realizing his true intentions.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Over by the campfire, Tyson let&#160;loose with his paintball gun. A&#160;blue projectile splattered&#160;<br/>against one of the centaurs, hurling him&#160;backward into the lake. The centaur came up&#160;<br/>grinning, covered in swamp muck and blue&#160;paint, and gave Tyson two thumbs up.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Annabeth,&#34; Chiron said, &#34;perhaps you and Grover would go supervise Tyson and my&#160;cousins&#160;<br/>before they, ah, teach each&#160;other too many bad habits?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth met his eyes. Some&#160;kind of&#160;understanding passed between them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Sure, Chiron,&#34; Annabeth said. &#34;Come on, goat boy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But I don't like paintball.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes, you do.&#34; She hoisted Grover to his hooves and led him&#160;off toward the campfire.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron finished bandaging my&#160;leg. &#34;Percy, I had a&#160;talk with Annabeth on the way here. A talk&#160;<br/>about the prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Uh-oh, I thought.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It wasn't&#160;her fault,&#34; I said. &#34;I made her tell me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>His eyes flickered with irritation. I was sure he was going to&#160;chew me&#160;out, but then his look&#160;<br/>turned to weari-ness. &#34;I suppose I could&#160;not expect to keep it secret forever.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=150></a>&#34;So am&#160;I the one in the prophecy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron tucked his bandages back into his pouch. &#34;I wish I knew, Percy. You're not yet&#160;<br/>sixteen. For now we must&#160;simply train you as best&#160;we can, and leave the future to the Fates.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Fates. I hadn't thought about those old ladies in a long time, but as soon as Chiron&#160;<br/>mentioned them, some-thing clicked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's what it meant,&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron frowned. &#34;That's what what meant?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Last summer. The omen from&#160;the Fates, when&#160;I saw them&#160;snip somebody's life string. I&#160;<br/>thought it meant I was going to die right away, but it's worse than that. It's&#160;got something to&#160;<br/>do with your prophecy. The death they foretold—it's going to happen when I'm&#160;sixteen.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron's tail whisked nervously in the grass.&#160;&#34;My boy, you can't&#160;be sure of that. We&#160;don't&#160;<br/>even know if the prophecy is about you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But there isn't any other half-blood child of the Big Three!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That we know of.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;And Kronos is rising. He's&#160;going to destroy Mount Olympus!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He will try,&#34; Chiron agreed. &#34;And Western Civilization along with it, if we don't stop him.&#160;<br/>But we will stop him.&#160;You will not&#160;be&#160;alone in that fight.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knew he was trying to make me&#160;feel&#160;better, but I remembered what Annabeth had told me. It&#160;<br/>would come&#160;down to one hero. One decision that&#160;would save or destroy the West. And I felt&#160;<br/>sure the Fates had been giving me&#160;some&#160;kind of&#160;warning about that. Something terrible was&#160;<br/>going to happen, either to me&#160;or to somebody I was close to.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;just a kid, Chiron,&#34; I said miserably. &#34;What good is one lousy hero against something&#160;<br/>like Kronos?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron managed a smile. '&#34;What good is one lousy hero'?&#160;Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain said&#160;<br/>something like that to me once, just before&#160;he single-handedly changed the course of&#160;your&#160;<br/>Civil War.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He pulled an arrow from&#160;his quiver and turned the razor-sharp tip&#160;so it glinted in the firelight.&#160;<br/>&#34;Celestial bronze, Percy. An immortal weapon. What would happen if you shot this at a&#160;<br/>human?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I said. &#34;It would pass right through.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's right,&#34; he said. &#34;Humans don't&#160;exist on&#160;the same&#160;level as the immortals. They can't&#160;<br/>even be hurt by our weapons. But you, Percy—you&#160;are part god, part human. You live in both&#160;<br/>worlds. You can be harmed by both, and you can&#160;affect both. That's&#160;what makes heroes so&#160;<br/>special. You carry the hopes of humanity into the realm&#160;of&#160;the eternal. Monsters never die.&#160;<br/>They are reborn from&#160;the&#160;chaos and barbarism&#160;that is always bubbling underneath civilization,&#160;<br/>the very stuff that makes Kronos stronger. They&#160;must be defeated again and again, kept at&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=151></a>bay. Heroes embody that struggle. You fight the battles humanity must win, every generation,&#160;<br/>in order to stay human. Do you understand?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I ... I don't know.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You must try, Percy. Because whether or not you are the child of the prophecy, Kronos&#160;<br/>thinks you might be. And after today, he will finally&#160;despair of turning you to his side. That is&#160;<br/>the only reason he hasn't&#160;killed you yet, you know.&#160;As soon as he's&#160;sure he can't use you, he&#160;<br/>will destroy you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You talk like you know him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron pursed his lips. &#34;I do know him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at him. I sometimes&#160;forgot just how old Chiron was.&#160;&#34;Is that why Mr. D blamed you&#160;<br/>when the tree was poi-soned?&#160;Why you said some people don't&#160;trust you?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Indeed.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But, Chiron ... I mean, come&#160;on! Why would&#160;they think you'd&#160;ever betray the camp for&#160;<br/>Kronos?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron's eyes were deep brown, full of thousands&#160;of years of sadness. &#34;Percy, remember your&#160;<br/>training. Remember your study of mythology. What&#160;is my&#160;connec-tion to the titan lord?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to think, but I'd always&#160;gotten my mythology mixed up. Even now, when it was so real,&#160;<br/>so important to my&#160;own life, I had trouble keeping all the names and&#160;facts straight. I shook&#160;<br/>my head. &#34;You, uh, owe Kronos a favor or something?&#160;He spared your life?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy,&#34; Chiron said, his voice impossibly soft. &#34;The titan Kronos is my&#160;father.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>NINETEEN&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>THE CHARIOT RACE&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>ENDS WITH&#160;A BANG&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We arrived in Long Island just after Clarisse, thanks to the centaurs'&#160;travel powers. I rode on&#160;<br/>Chiron's back, but we didn't talk much, especially not about Kronos. I knew it had been&#160;<br/>difficult for Chiron to tell me. I didn't&#160;want to&#160;push him&#160;with more questions. I mean, I've met&#160;<br/>plenty of embar-rassing parents, but Kronos, the evil titan lord who wanted to destroy&#160;<br/>Western Civilization?&#160;Not the kind of dad you invited to school for career day.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=152></a>&#160;<br/>When we got to camp, the centaurs were anxious&#160;to meet Dionysus. They'd&#160;heard he threw&#160;<br/>some&#160;really wild par-ties, but they were&#160;disappointed. The wine god was in no mood to&#160;<br/>celebrate as the whole camp gathered&#160;at the top of Half-Blood Hill.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The camp had been through a hard two weeks. The arts and crafts cabin had burned to the&#160;<br/>ground from an attack by a Draco Aionius (which as near as I could figure was Latin for&#160;<br/>&#34;really-big-lizard-with-breath-that-blows-stuff-up&#34;). The Big House's rooms were&#160;<br/>overflowing with wounded. The kids in the Apollo&#160;cabin, who were the best healers, had been&#160;<br/>working overtime performing first aid. Everybody&#160;looked weary and battered as we crowded&#160;<br/>around Thalia's&#160;tree.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The moment Clarisse draped the Golden Fleece over the lowest bough, the moonlight seemed&#160;<br/>to brighten, turn-ing from gray to liquid silver. A cool breeze rustled in the branches and&#160;<br/>rippled through the grass, all&#160;the way into the valley. Everything came&#160;into sharper focus—<br/>the glow of the fireflies down in the woods, the smell of the straw-berry&#160;fields, the sound of&#160;<br/>the waves on&#160;the beach.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Gradually, the needles on the pine tree&#160;started turning from&#160;brown to green.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Everybody cheered. It was happening slowly,&#160;but there could be no doubt—the Fleece's&#160;<br/>magic was seeping into the tree, filling&#160;it with new power and expelling the poison.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron ordered a twenty-four/seven guard duty on the hilltop,&#160;at least until he could find an&#160;<br/>appropriate monster to protect the Fleece. He said he'd&#160;place an ad in Olympus Weekly right&#160;<br/>away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In the meantime, Clarisse was carried on her cabin mates'&#160;shoulders down to the&#160;<br/>amphitheater, where she was honored with a laurel wreath and a lot of celebrating around the&#160;<br/>campfire.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nobody gave Annabeth or me&#160;a second look. It was as if we'd&#160;never left. In a way, I guess&#160;<br/>that was the best thank-you anyone could give us, because if they admitted we'd&#160;snuck out of&#160;<br/>camp to do the quest, they'd&#160;have to expel us. And really, I didn't&#160;want any more attention. It&#160;<br/>felt good to be just one of the campers for once.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Later that night, as we were roasting s'mores and listen-ing to the Stoll brothers tell us a ghost&#160;<br/>story about an evil king who was eaten alive by demonic breakfast pastries, Clarisse shoved&#160;<br/>me&#160;from&#160;behind and whispered in my&#160;ear, &#34;Just because you were cool one time, Jackson,&#160;<br/>don't think you're off the hook with Ares. I'm&#160;still waiting for the right opportunity to&#160;<br/>pulverize you.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I gave her a grudging smile.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; she demanded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I said. &#34;Just good to be home.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The next morning, after the party ponies headed&#160;back to Florida, Chiron made a surprise&#160;<br/>announcement: the chariot races would go ahead as&#160;scheduled. We'd&#160;all figured they were&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=153></a>history now that Tantalus was&#160;gone, but completing them&#160;did feel like the right thing to do,&#160;<br/>especially now that Chiron was back and the camp was safe.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson wasn't too keen on the idea of getting back&#160;in a chariot after our&#160;first experience, but he&#160;<br/>was happy to let me&#160;team up with Annabeth.&#160;I would drive, Annabeth would defend, and&#160;<br/>Tyson would act as our pit crew. While I worked with the horses, Tyson fixed up Athena's&#160;<br/>chariot and added a whole bunch&#160;of special modifi-cations.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We spent the next two days training like crazy.&#160;Annabeth and I agreed&#160;that if we won, the&#160;<br/>prize of no chores for the rest of the month&#160;would be split between our two cabins. Since&#160;<br/>Athena had more campers, they would get most&#160;of the time off, which was fine by me. I didn't&#160;<br/>care about the prize. I just wanted to win.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The night before the race, I stayed&#160;late at the stables. I was talking to our horses, giving them&#160;<br/>one final brushing, when somebody right behind me&#160;said, &#34;Fine animals, horses. Wish I'd&#160;<br/>thought of them.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A middle-aged guy in a postal carrier outfit was leaning against&#160;the stable door. He was slim,&#160;<br/>with curly black hair under his white pith&#160;helmet, and he had a mailbag slung over his&#160;<br/>shoulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hermes?&#34; I stammered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hello, Percy. Didn't recognize me&#160;without my&#160;jogging clothes?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Uh ...&#34; I wasn't&#160;sure whether I was supposed to&#160;kneel or buy stamps from him&#160;or what. Then&#160;<br/>it occurred to me&#160;why he must be here.&#160;&#34;Oh, listen, Lord Hermes, about Luke ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The god arched his eyebrows.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Uh, we saw him,&#160;all right,&#34; I said, &#34;but—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You weren't able to talk&#160;sense into him?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Well, we kind of tried to kill each&#160;other in a duel to the death.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I see. You tried the diplomatic approach.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;really sorry. I mean, you gave us those awesome gifts and everything. And I know you&#160;<br/>wanted Luke to come&#160;back. But ... he's&#160;turned&#160;bad. Really bad. He&#160;said he feels like you&#160;<br/>abandoned him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I waited for Hermes to get angry. I figured he'd&#160;turn me&#160;into a hamster or something, and I did&#160;<br/>not want to spend any more time&#160;as a rodent.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Instead, he just sighed. &#34;Do you ever feel your father abandoned you, Percy?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Oh, man.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to say, &#34;Only a few hundred times a&#160;day.&#34; I hadn't spoken to Poseidon since last&#160;<br/>summer. &#160;I'd never been to his underwater palace. And then there was the whole thing with&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=154></a>Tyson—no warning, no explanation. Just boom, you have a brother. You'd think that deserved&#160;<br/>a little heads-up phone call or something.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I&#160;realized I did want recognition for the quest&#160;<br/>I'd completed, but not from&#160;the other campers. I&#160;wanted my&#160;dad to say something. To notice&#160;<br/>me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes readjusted the mailbag on his shoulder.&#160;&#34;Percy, the hardest part about being a god is&#160;<br/>that you must often act indirectly, especially when it comes to&#160;your own children. If we were&#160;<br/>to intervene every time&#160;our children had a problem … well, that would only create more&#160;<br/>problems and more resentment. But I believe if&#160;you give it some&#160;thought, you will see that&#160;<br/>Poseidon has been paying attention to you. He&#160;has answered your prayers. I can only hope&#160;<br/>that some&#160;day, Luke may realize the same&#160;about me. Whether you feel like you succeeded or&#160;<br/>not, you reminded Luke who he was. You spoke to him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I tried to kill him.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hermes shrugged. &#34;Families are messy. Immortal&#160;families are eternally messy. Sometimes the&#160;<br/>best we can do is to remind each other that we're related, for better or worse … and try to&#160;<br/>keep the maiming and killing to a minimum.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It didn't sound like much of a recipe for the perfect family. Then again, as I thought about my&#160;<br/>quest, I realized maybe Hermes was&#160;right. Poseidon had sent the hippocampi to help us. He'd&#160;<br/>given me&#160;powers over the sea that I'd never known about before. And there was Tyson. Had&#160;<br/>Poseidon brought us together on purpose?&#160;How many times had Tyson saved my&#160;life&#160;this&#160;<br/>summer?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In the distance, the conch&#160;horn sounded, signaling curfew.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You should get to bed,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;I've&#160;helped you get into quite enough trouble this&#160;<br/>summer already. I really only came to make this delivery.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;A delivery?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I am&#160;the messenger of the gods, Percy.&#34; He took an electronic signature pad from&#160;his&#160;<br/>mailbag and handed it to me. &#34;Sign there, please.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I picked up the stylus before realizing it was entwined with a pair of tiny green snakes. &#34;Ah!&#34;&#160;<br/>I dropped the pad.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Ouch, said George.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Really, Percy, Martha scolded.&#160;Would you want to be dropped on the floor of a horse stable?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, uh, sorry.&#34; I didn't much like touching snakes, but I picked up the pad and the stylus&#160;<br/>again. Martha and George wriggled under my&#160;fingers, forming a kind of pencil grip like the&#160;<br/>ones my&#160;special ed teacher made me&#160;use in second grade.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Did you bring me&#160;a rat?&#160;George asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No …&#34; I said. &#34;Uh, we didn't find any.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=155></a>What about a guinea pig?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>George! Martha chided. Don't tease the boy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I signed my&#160;name&#160;and gave the pad back to Hermes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In exchange, he handed me&#160;a sea-blue envelope.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>My fingers trembled. Even before I opened it, I&#160;could tell it was from&#160;my father. I could sense&#160;<br/>his power in&#160;the cool blue&#160;paper, as if the envelope&#160;itself had been folded out of an ocean&#160;<br/>wave.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Good luck tomorrow,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;Fine team of horses you have there, though you'll&#160;<br/>excuse me&#160;if I root for the Hermes cabin.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And don't be too discouraged when you read it,&#160;dear, Martha told me. He&#160;does have your&#160;<br/>interests at heart.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Don't mind her, George said. And next&#160;time, remember, snakes work for tips.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Enough, you two,&#34; Hermes said. &#34;Good-bye, Percy. For now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Small white wings sprouted from&#160;his pith helmet. He began to glow, and I knew enough about&#160;<br/>the gods to avert my&#160;eyes before he revealed his true divine form. With&#160;a brilliant white flash&#160;<br/>he was gone, and I was alone with the horses.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at the blue envelope in my&#160;hands. It&#160;was addressed in&#160;strong but elegant handwriting&#160;<br/>that I'd seen once before, on a package Poseidon had sent me&#160;last summer.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Percy Jackson&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>c/o Camp&#160;Half-Blood&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Farm&#160;Road 3.141&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Long Island, New York 11954&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>An actual letter from&#160;my&#160;father. Maybe he&#160;would tell me&#160;I'd done a good job getting the&#160;<br/>Fleece. He'd&#160;explain about Tyson,&#160;or apologize for not talking&#160;to me&#160;sooner. There were so&#160;<br/>many things that I wanted&#160;that letter to say.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I opened the envelope and unfolded the paper.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Two simple words were printed in the middle of the page:&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=156></a>&#160;<br/>Brace Yourself&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The next morning, everybody was buzzing about the chari-ot&#160;race, though&#160;they kept glancing&#160;<br/>nervously toward the sky like they expected to&#160;see Stymphalian birds gathering. None did. It&#160;<br/>was a beautiful summer day with blue sky and&#160;plenty of sunshine. The camp had started to&#160;<br/>look the way it should look: the meadows were&#160;green and lush; the white columns gleamed on&#160;<br/>the Greek buildings; dryads played happily in the woods.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And I was miserable. I'd been lying awake all night, thinking about Poseidon's warning.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Brace yourself.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I mean, he goes to the trouble of writing&#160;a letter, and he writes two words?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Martha the snake had told me&#160;not to feel&#160;disappointed. Maybe Poseidon had a reason for&#160;<br/>being so vague. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was warning me&#160;about, but he sensed&#160;<br/>something big was about to happen—something that could completely knock me&#160;off my&#160;feet&#160;<br/>unless I was prepared. It was hard, but I&#160;tried to turn my&#160;thoughts to the race.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As Annabeth and I drove onto the track, I couldn't&#160;help admiring the work Tyson had done on&#160;<br/>the Athena chariot. The carriage gleamed with bronze reinforcements. The wheels were&#160;<br/>realigned with magical suspension so we glided along with hardly a bump. The rigging for the&#160;<br/>horses was so&#160;perfectly balanced that the team&#160;turned at the slightest tug of&#160;the reins.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson had also made us two javelins,&#160;each with&#160;three buttons&#160;on the shaft. The first button&#160;<br/>primed the javelin to explode on impact, releasing razor wire that would tangle and shred an&#160;<br/>opponent's&#160;wheels. The second button pro-duced&#160;a blunt (but still very painful) bronze&#160;<br/>spearhead designed to knock a driver out of&#160;his carriage. The third button brought up a&#160;<br/>grappling hook that could be used to lock&#160;onto an enemy's chariot or push it away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I figured we were in pretty good shape for the race, but Tyson still warned me&#160;to be careful.&#160;<br/>The other chariot teams had plenty of tricks up their togas.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Here,&#34; he said, just&#160;before the race began.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He handed me&#160;a wristwatch. There wasn't&#160;anything spe-cial about&#160;it—just a white-and-silver&#160;<br/>clock face, a black leather strap—but as soon as I&#160;saw it I realized that this is what I'd seen&#160;<br/>him&#160;tinkering on all summer.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't usually like to wear watches. Who cared what time it was?&#160;But I couldn't say no to&#160;<br/>Tyson.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Thanks, man.&#34; I put it on and found it was surprisingly light and comfortable. I could hardly&#160;<br/>tell I was wearing it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Didn't finish in time for the trip,&#34; Tyson mumbled. &#34;Sorry, sorry.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey, man. No big deal.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=157></a>&#34;If you need&#160;protection in race,&#34; he&#160;advised, &#34;hit the button.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Ah, okay.&#34; I didn't see how keeping time was going to help a whole lot, but I was touched&#160;<br/>that Tyson was con-cerned. I promised him&#160;I'd remember the watch. &#34;And, hey, um, Tyson&#160;<br/>...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He looked at me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I wanted to say, well ...&#34; I tried to figure out how to apologize for getting embarrassed about&#160;<br/>him&#160;before the quest, for telling everyone he wasn't&#160;my&#160;real brother. It wasn't&#160;easy to find the&#160;<br/>words.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I know what you will tell me,&#34; Tyson said, looking ashamed. &#34;Poseidon did care for me&#160;after&#160;<br/>all.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Uh, well—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;He sent you to help me. Just what I asked for.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I blinked. &#34;You asked Poseidon for ... me?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;For a friend,&#34; Tyson said, twisting his shirt in his hands. &#34;Young Cyclopes grow up alone on&#160;<br/>the streets, learn to make things&#160;out of scraps. Learn to survive.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But that's&#160;so cruel!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He shook his head earnestly. &#34;Makes us appreciate blessings, not be greedy and mean and fat&#160;<br/>like Polyphemus. But I got scared. Monsters chased me&#160;so much, clawed me&#160;sometimes—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The scars on your back?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A tear welled in his eye. &#34;Sphinx on Seventy-second&#160;Street. Big bully. I prayed to Daddy for&#160;<br/>help. Soon the peo-ple at Meriwether found me. Met you. Biggest blessing ever. Sorry I said&#160;<br/>Poseidon was mean. He sent me&#160;a brother.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared at the watch that Tyson had made me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy!&#34; Annabeth called. &#34;Come on!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron was at the starting line,&#160;ready to blow the conch.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson ...&#34; I said.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Go,&#34; Tyson said. &#34;You will win!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I—yeah, okay, big guy. We'll win this one for&#160;you.&#34; I climbed on board&#160;the chariot and got&#160;<br/>into position&#160;just as Chiron blew the starting signal.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The horses knew what to do. We&#160;shot down the track&#160;so fast I would've fallen out if my arms&#160;<br/>hadn't been wrapped in the leather reins. Annabeth held on tight to the rail.&#160;The wheels glided&#160;<br/>beautifully. We took the first turn a full chariot-length ahead of Clarisse, who was busy trying&#160;<br/>to fight off a javelin attack from&#160;the Stoll brothers in the Hermes chariot.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=158></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;We've got 'em!&#34; I yelled, but I spoke too soon.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Incoming!&#34; Annabeth yelled. She threw her first javelin in grappling hook mode, knocking&#160;<br/>away a lead-weighted net that&#160;would have entangled us both. Apollo's&#160;chariot had come up on&#160;<br/>our flank. Before Annabeth could rearm&#160;her-self,&#160;the Apollo warrior threw a javelin into our&#160;<br/>right wheel. The javelin shattered, but not before snapping some&#160;of our spokes. Our chariot&#160;<br/>lurched and wobbled. I was sure the wheel would collapse altogether, but we somehow kept&#160;<br/>going.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I urged the horses to keep up the speed. We&#160;were now neck and neck with Apollo. Hephaestus&#160;<br/>was coming up close behind. Ares and Hermes were falling behind, riding side by side as&#160;<br/>Clarisse went sword-on-javelin with Connor Stoll.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>If we took one more hit to our wheel, I knew we would capsize.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're mine!&#34; the driver from&#160;Apollo yelled. He was a first-year camper. I didn't remember&#160;<br/>his name, but he sure was confident.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, right!&#34; Annabeth yelled back.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She picked up her second javelin—a real risk&#160;consider-ing we&#160;still&#160;had one full lap to go—<br/>and threw it at the Apollo driver.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Her aim&#160;was&#160;perfect. The javelin grew a heavy spear&#160;point&#160;just as it caught the driver&#160;in the&#160;<br/>chest, knocking him&#160;against his teammate and sending them&#160;both toppling out of their chariot&#160;<br/>in a backward somersault. The horses felt the reins go slack and went crazy, riding straight for&#160;<br/>the crowd. Campers scrambled for cover as the horses leaped&#160;the corner of&#160;the bleachers and&#160;<br/>the golden chariot flipped over.&#160;The horses galloped back toward their stable, dragging the&#160;<br/>upside-down chariot behind them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I held our own chariot together through the second turn, despite the groaning of the right&#160;<br/>wheel. We&#160;passed the starting line&#160;and thundered into our final lap.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The axle creaked and moaned. The wobbling wheel was making us lose speed, even though&#160;<br/>the horses were respond-ing to my&#160;every command, running like a well-oiled machine.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Hephaestus team&#160;was still gaining.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Beckendorf grinned as he pressed a button on his com-mand console. Steel cables shot out of&#160;<br/>the front of his mechanical horses, wrapping around our back rail. Our chariot shuddered as&#160;<br/>Beckendorf's winch system&#160;started working—pulling us backward while Beckendorf pulled&#160;<br/>himself forward.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth cursed and drew her knife. She hacked at the cables&#160;but they were too thick.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Can't&#160;cut them.'&#34; she yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The Hephaestus chariot was now dangerously close, their horses about to trample us&#160;<br/>underfoot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Switch with me!&#34; I told&#160;Annabeth. &#34;Take the reins!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=159></a>&#160;<br/>&#34;But—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Trust me!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She pulled herself to the front and grabbed the reins. I turned, trying hard to keep my&#160;footing,&#160;<br/>and uncapped Riptide.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I slashed down and the cables snapped like kite string. We&#160;lurched forward, but Beckendorf's&#160;<br/>driver just swung his chariot to&#160;our left and pulled up next to&#160;us. Beckendorf drew his sword.&#160;<br/>He slashed at Annabeth, and I parried the blade away.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were coming up on the last turn. We'd&#160;never make it. I needed to disable the Hephaestus&#160;<br/>chariot and get it out of the way, but I had to&#160;protect Annabeth, too. Just because Beckendorf&#160;<br/>was a nice guy didn't mean he wouldn't send us&#160;both to the infirmary&#160;if we let our guard&#160;<br/>down.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We were neck and neck now, Clarisse coming up from&#160;behind, making up for lost time.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;See ya, Percy!&#34; Beckendorf yelled.&#160;&#34;Here's a little part-ing gift!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He threw a leather pouch into&#160;our chariot. It stuck to the floor immediately and began&#160;<br/>billowing green smoke.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Greek fire!&#34; Annabeth yelled.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I cursed. I'd heard stories about&#160;what Greek fire could do. I figured we had maybe ten seconds&#160;<br/>before it exploded.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Get rid of it!&#34; Annabeth shouted, but I couldn't. Hephaestus's chariot was still alongside,&#160;<br/>waiting until the last second to make&#160;sure their little present blew up. Beckendorf was keeping&#160;<br/>me&#160;busy with his sword. If I let my&#160;guard&#160;down long enough to deal with the Greek fire,&#160;<br/>Annabeth would get sliced and we'd&#160;crash anyway. I tried to kick the leather pouch away with&#160;<br/>my foot, but I couldn't. It was stuck fast.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I remembered the watch.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I didn't know how it could help, but I managed&#160;to punch the stopwatch button. Instantly, the&#160;<br/>watch changed. It expanded, the metal rim&#160;spiraling outward like an old-fashioned camera&#160;<br/>shutter, a leather strap wrapping around my&#160;forearm&#160;until I was holding a round war shield&#160;<br/>four feet wide, the inside soft leather, the&#160;outside polished bronze engraved with designs I&#160;<br/>didn't have time&#160;to examine.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>All I knew: Tyson had come&#160;through. I raised&#160;the shield, and Beckendorf's sword clanged&#160;<br/>against it. His blade shat-tered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;What?&#34; he shouted. &#34;How—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He didn't have time to say more because I knocked him&#160;in the chest with my new shield and&#160;<br/>sent him&#160;flying out of his chariot, tumbling in the dirt.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I was about use Riptide to slash at the&#160;driver when Annabeth yelled, &#34;Percy!&#34;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=160></a>&#160;<br/>The Greek fire was shooting sparks. I shoved the tip of my&#160;sword under the leather pouch and&#160;<br/>flipped it up like a spatula. The firebomb&#160;dislodged and flew into the Hephaestus chariot at&#160;<br/>the driver's&#160;feet. He yelped.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In a split second the driver made&#160;the right choice: he dove out of&#160;the chariot, which careened&#160;<br/>away and exploded in green flames. The metal horses seemed&#160;to short-circuit. They turned&#160;<br/>and dragged the burning wreckage back toward Clarisse and the Stoll brothers, who had to&#160;<br/>swerve to avoid it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth pulled the reins for the last turn. I held on, sure we&#160;would capsize, but somehow she&#160;<br/>brought us through and spurred the horses across the finish line. The crowd roared.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Once the chariot stopped, our friends mobbed us. They started chanting our names, but&#160;<br/>Annabeth yelled over the noise: &#34;Hold&#160;up! Listen! It wasn't&#160;just us!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The crowd didn't want to be quiet, but Annabeth&#160;made herself heard: &#34;We couldn't have done&#160;<br/>it without somebody else! We&#160;couldn't have won&#160;this race or gotten the Fleece or saved&#160;<br/>Grover or anything! We&#160;owe our lives to Tyson, Percy's ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Brother!&#34; I said, loud enough for everybody to hear. &#34;Tyson, my baby brother.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson blushed. The crowd cheered. Annabeth planted a kiss on my&#160;cheek. The roaring got a&#160;<br/>lot louder after that. The entire Athena&#160;cabin&#160;lifted me&#160;and Annabeth and Tyson onto their&#160;<br/>shoulders and carried us toward the winner's&#160;platform, where Chiron was waiting to bestow&#160;<br/>the laurel wreaths.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>TWENTY&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>THE FLEECE WORKS&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>ITS MAGIC&#160;TOO WELL&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That afternoon was one of the happiest I'd ever spent at camp, which maybe goes to show,&#160;<br/>you never know when your world is&#160;about to be rocked to pieces.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover announced that he'd&#160;be able to spend the rest of the summer with us before resuming&#160;<br/>his quest for Pan. His bosses at the Council of Cloven Elders were so impressed that he hadn't&#160;<br/>gotten himself killed and had cleared the way for future searchers, that they granted him&#160;a&#160;<br/>two-month fur-lough and a new set of reed pipes. The only bad news: Grover insisted on&#160;<br/>playing those pipes all afternoon long, and his musical skills&#160;hadn't improved much. He&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=161></a>played &#34;YMCA,&#34; and the strawberry plants started going crazy, wrapping around our feet like&#160;<br/>they were trying to strangle&#160;us. I guess I couldn't blame them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover told me&#160;he could dissolve the empathy link between us, now that we were face to face,&#160;<br/>but I told him I'd just as soon keep it if that&#160;was okay with him. He put down his reed pipes&#160;<br/>and stared at me. &#34;But, if I get in trouble again, you'll be in&#160;danger, Percy! You could die!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;If you get in trouble again, I want to know about&#160;it. And I'll come&#160;help you again, G-man. I&#160;<br/>wouldn't have it any other way.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In the end he agreed not to break the link.&#160;He went back to playing &#34;YMCA&#34; for the&#160;<br/>strawberry plants. I didn't need an empathy link&#160;with the plants to know&#160;how they felt about it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Later on during archery class, Chiron pulled me&#160;aside and told me&#160;he'd&#160;fixed my&#160;problems&#160;<br/>with Meriwether Prep. The school no longer blamed me&#160;for&#160;destroying their gym-nasium.&#160;The&#160;<br/>police were no longer looking for me.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;How did you manage that?&#34;&#160;I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron's eyes twinkled. &#34;I merely suggested that the mortals had seen something different on&#160;<br/>that day—a fur-nace explosion that was not your fault.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You just said that and they bought it?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I manipulated the Mist. Some&#160;day, when&#160;you're&#160;ready, I'll show how it's&#160;done.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You mean, I can go back to Meriwether next year?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Chiron raised his eyebrows. &#34;Oh, no, they've still expelled you. Your headmaster, Mr. Bonsai,&#160;<br/>said you had—how did he put it?—un-groovy karma that disrupted the school's&#160;educational&#160;<br/>aura. But you're not in any legal trou-ble, which was a relief&#160;to your mother. Oh, and speaking&#160;<br/>of your mother ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He unclipped his cell phone from&#160;his quiver and handed it to me. &#34;It's high time you called&#160;<br/>her.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The worst part was the beginning—the &#34;Percy-Jackson-what-were-you-thinking-do-you-<br/>have-any-idea-how-worried-I-was-sneaking-off-to-camp-without-permission-going-on-<br/>dangerous-quests-and-scaring-me-half-to-death&#34; part.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But finally she paused to catch her breath. &#34;Oh, I'm just glad you're safe!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's&#160;the great thing about my&#160;mom. She's no good at staying angry. She tries, but it just isn't&#160;<br/>in her nature.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;sorry, Mom,&#34; I told her. &#34;I won't scare you again.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=162></a>&#34;Don't promise me&#160;that, Percy. You know very well it will only get worse.&#34; She tried&#160;to sound&#160;<br/>casual about it, but I could tell she was pretty shaken up.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wanted to say something to make her feel&#160;better, but I knew she&#160;was right. Being a half-<br/>blood, I would always be doing things that scared&#160;her. And as I got older, the dangers would&#160;<br/>just get greater.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I could come&#160;home for&#160;a while,&#34; I offered.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No, no. Stay at camp. Train. Do what you need to do. But you will come&#160;home for the next&#160;<br/>school year?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yeah, of course. Uh, if there's any school that will take me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Oh, we'll find something, dear,&#34; my&#160;mother sighed. &#34;Some place where they don't know us&#160;<br/>yet.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As for Tyson, the campers treated him like a hero. I would've been happy to have him as my&#160;<br/>cabin mate forever, but that evening, as we&#160;were sitting on a sand dune overlooking the Long&#160;<br/>Island Sound, he made an&#160;announcement that com-pletely took me&#160;by surprise.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Dream&#160;came from&#160;Daddy last night,&#34;&#160;he said. &#34;He wants me&#160;to visit.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I wondered if he was kidding, but Tyson really&#160;didn't know how to kid. &#34;Poseidon sent you a&#160;<br/>dream&#160;message?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson nodded. &#34;Wants me&#160;to go underwater for the rest of the summer. Learn to work at&#160;<br/>Cyclopes'&#160;forges. He called it an inter—an intern—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;An internship?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Yes.&#34; I let that sink in. I'll admit, I felt a&#160;little jealous. Poseidon had never invited me&#160;<br/>underwater. &#160;But then I thought, Tyson was going?&#160;Just like that?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;When would you leave?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Now. Like ... now now?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I stared out at the waves in the Long Island Sound. The water was glistening red in the sunset.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;happy for you, big guy,&#34; I managed. &#34;Seriously.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hard to leave my&#160;new brother,&#34; he said with&#160;a tremble in his voice. &#34;But I want to make&#160;<br/>things. Weapons for the camp. You will need them.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=163></a>Unfortunately, I knew he was right. The Fleece hadn't solved all the camp's problems. Luke&#160;<br/>was still out there, gathering an army&#160;aboard&#160;the Princess Andromeda. Kronos was still re-<br/>forming in his golden coffin. Eventually, we would have to fight them.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You'll make the best weapons ever,&#34; I told Tyson. I held up my watch proudly. &#34;I bet they'll&#160;<br/>tell good time, too.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyson sniffled. &#34;Brothers help each other.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;You're my&#160;brother,&#34; I said. &#34;No doubt about it.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He patted me&#160;on the back so hard he almost&#160;knocked me&#160;down the sand dune. Then he wiped&#160;<br/>a tear from&#160;his cheek and stood to&#160;go. &#34;Use the shield well.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I will, big guy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Save your life some&#160;day.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The way he said it, so matter-of-fact, I wondered&#160;if that Cyclops eye of his could see into the&#160;<br/>future.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>He headed down to the beach and whistled. Rainbow, the hippocampus, burst out of the&#160;<br/>waves. I watched the two of them&#160;ride&#160;off together into the realm&#160;of Poseidon.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Once they were gone, I looked down at my&#160;new wristwatch.&#160;I pressed the button and the&#160;<br/>shield spiraled out to full size. Hammered into the bronze were pictures in Ancient Greek&#160;<br/>style, scenes from&#160;our adventures this sum-mer. There was Annabeth slaying a Laistrygonian&#160;<br/>dodgeball player, me&#160;fighting the bronze bulls&#160;on Half-Blood Hill, Tyson riding Rainbow&#160;<br/>toward the Princess Andromeda, the CSS Birmingham&#160;blasting its cannons at Charybdis. I ran&#160;<br/>my hand across a picture of Tyson, battling the&#160;Hydra as he held aloft a box of Monster&#160;<br/>Donuts.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I couldn't help feeling sad. I knew Tyson would have an awesome time under the ocean. But&#160;<br/>I'd miss everything about him—his fascination with&#160;horses, the way he could fix chariots or&#160;<br/>crumple metal with his bare hands, or tie bad&#160;guys into knots. I'd even miss him&#160;snoring like&#160;<br/>an earth-quake in the next bunk all night.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Hey, Percy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I turned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth and Grover were standing at the top of the sand dune. I guess maybe I had some&#160;<br/>sand in my&#160;eyes, because&#160;I was blinking a lot.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Tyson ...&#34; I told them. &#34;He had to ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;We know,&#34; Annabeth said softly. &#34;Chiron told us.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Cyclopes forges.&#34; Grover shuddered. &#34;I hear&#160;the cafete-ria food there is terrible! Like, no&#160;<br/>enchiladas at all.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Annabeth held out her hand. &#34;Come&#160;on, Seaweed Brain. Time&#160;for dinner.&#34;&#160;<br/>

<a name=164></a>&#160;<br/>We walked back toward the dining pavilion together, just the three of us, like old times.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A storm&#160;raged that night, but it parted around&#160;Camp Half-Blood as storms&#160;usually did.&#160;<br/>Lightning flashed against the horizon, waves&#160;pounded the shore, but not a drop fell in our&#160;<br/>valley. We&#160;were protected again, thanks to the Fleece, sealed inside our magical borders.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Still, my&#160;dreams were restless. I heard Kronos&#160;taunting me&#160;from&#160;the depths of Tartarus:&#160;<br/>Polyphemus&#160;sits blindly in his cave, young hero, believing he has won&#160;a great victory. Are&#160;<br/>you any less deluded?&#160;The titan's&#160;cold laughter filled the darkness.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then my&#160;dream&#160;changed. I was following Tyson to&#160;the bottom of&#160;the sea, into the court of&#160;<br/>Poseidon. It was a radi-ant hall filled&#160;with blue&#160;light, the floor cobbled with pearls. And there,&#160;<br/>on a throne of coral, sat my father, dressed like a simple fisherman in khaki shorts and a sun-<br/>bleached T-shirt. I looked up into his tan weathered face, his deep green eyes, and he spoke&#160;<br/>two words: Brace yourself.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I woke with a start.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>There was a banging on the door. Grover flew inside without waiting for permission. &#34;Percy!&#34;&#160;<br/>he stammered. &#34;Annabeth ... on the hill ... she ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The look in his eyes told me&#160;something was&#160;terribly wrong. Annabeth had been on guard duty&#160;<br/>that night, pro-tecting the Fleece.&#160;If something had happened—&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I ripped off the covers, my&#160;blood like ice water&#160;in my veins. I threw on some&#160;clothes while&#160;<br/>Grover tried to make a complete sentence, but&#160;he was too stunned, too&#160;out of breath. &#34;She's&#160;<br/>lying there ... just lying there ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I ran outside and raced across&#160;the central yard, Grover right behind me. Dawn was just&#160;<br/>breaking, but the whole camp seemed&#160;to be stirring. Word was spreading. Something huge&#160;<br/>had happened. A few campers were already making their way toward the&#160;hill, satyrs and&#160;<br/>nymphs and heroes in a weird mix of armor and pajamas.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I heard the clop of horse hooves, and Chiron galloped up behind us, looking grim.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Is it true?&#34;&#160;he asked Grover.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Grover could only nod, his expression dazed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I tried to ask what was going on,&#160;but Chiron grabbed me&#160;by the arm&#160;and effortlessly lifted me&#160;<br/>onto his back. Together we thundered up Half-Blood Hill, where a small crowd had started to&#160;<br/>gather.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I expected to see the Fleece missing from&#160;the pine&#160;tree, but it was still there, glittering in the&#160;<br/>first light of dawn. The storm&#160;had broken and the sky was bloodred.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Curse the titan lord,&#34; Chiron&#160;said. &#34;He's tricked us again, given himself another chance to&#160;<br/>control the prophecy.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=165></a>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;The Fleece,&#34; he said. &#34;The Fleece did its work too well.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We galloped forward, everyone moving out of our&#160;way. There at the base&#160;of the tree, a girl&#160;<br/>was lying unconscious. Another girl in&#160;Greek armor was kneeling next to her.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Blood roared in my&#160;ears. I couldn't think straight. Annabeth had been attacked?&#160;But why was&#160;<br/>the Fleece still there?&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The tree itself looked perfectly&#160;fine, whole and healthy, suffused with the essence of the&#160;<br/>Golden Fleece.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It healed the tree,&#34; Chiron said, his voice ragged. &#34;And poison was not the only thing it&#160;<br/>purged.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then I realized Annabeth wasn't&#160;the one&#160;lying on the ground. She was the one in armor,&#160;<br/>kneeling next to the unconscious girl. When Annabeth saw us, she ran to Chiron. &#34;It... she ...&#160;<br/>just suddenly there ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Her eyes were streaming with tears, but I still didn't understand. I was too freaked out to make&#160;<br/>sense of it all. I leaped off Chiron's back and ran toward the unconscious girl. Chiron said:&#160;<br/>&#34;Percy, wait!&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I knelt by her side. She had short black hair and freck-les across her nose. She was built like a&#160;<br/>long-distance runner, lithe and&#160;strong, and she wore clothes that were somewhere between&#160;<br/>punk and Goth—a black T-shirt, black tattered jeans, and a leather jacket with buttons from&#160;a&#160;<br/>bunch of bands I'd never heard of.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>She wasn't&#160;a camper. I didn't recognize her from&#160;any of the cabins. And yet I had the strangest&#160;<br/>feeling I'd seen her before....&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's true,&#34; Grover said, panting from&#160;his run up the hill. &#34;I can't&#160;believe ...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nobody else came close to the girl.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I put my&#160;hand on her forehead. Her skin was cold, but my&#160;fingertips tingled as if they were&#160;<br/>burning.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;She needs nectar and ambrosia,&#34; I said. She was clearly a half-blood, whether she was a&#160;<br/>camper or not. I could sense that just from&#160;one touch. I didn't understand why everyone was&#160;<br/>acting so scared.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I took her by the shoulders and lifted her into sitting position, resting her head on my&#160;<br/>shoulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Come on!&#34; I yelled to the others. &#34;What's wrong with you people?&#160;Let's get her to the Big&#160;<br/>House.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>No one moved, not even Chiron. They were all too stunned.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Then the girl took a shaky breath. She coughed and opened her eyes.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=166></a>&#160;<br/>Her irises were startlingly blue—electric blue.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The girl stared at me&#160;in bewilderment, shivering and wild-eyed. &#34;Who—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I'm&#160;Percy,&#34; I said. &#34;You're safe now.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Strangest dream&#160;...&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It's okay.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Dying.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;No,&#34; I assured her. &#34;You're okay. What's&#160;your name?&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's&#160;when I knew. Even before she said it.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The girl's&#160;blue eyes stared into mine, and I understood what the Golden Fleece quest had been&#160;<br/>about. The poison-ing of the tree.&#160;Everything. Kronos had done it&#160;to bring another chess piece&#160;<br/>into play—another chance&#160;to control the prophecy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Even Chiron, Annabeth, and Grover, who should've been celebrating this moment, were too&#160;<br/>shocked, thinking about what it might mean for the future. And I was holding someone who&#160;<br/>was destined to be my&#160;best friend, or possi-bly my worst enemy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;I am&#160;Thalia,&#34; the girl said. &#34;Daughter of Zeus.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
