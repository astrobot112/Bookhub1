<a name=3></a><b>Chapter&#160;1 &#160; Jim Hawkins’&#160;Story I&#160;<br/></b>&#160;<br/>
My father had an inn near the sea.&#160;It was a quiet place. One day,&#160;<br/>
an old man came to our door. He&#160;was tall and strong, and his face&#160;<br/>was&#160;brown. His&#160;old blue coat was&#160;dirty and he had a big old box&#160;<br/>with him. He looked at the inn,&#160;then he looked at the sea.&#160;<br/>
&#160; &#160; &#160;My father came to&#160;the door.&#160;<br/>
&#160;At first the old man did not speak. He looked again at the sea,&#160;<br/>
and at the front of&#160;the inn.&#160;<br/>
&#160;‘I like this place,’ he said.&#160;‘Do many people come here?’&#160;<br/>
‘No,’ said my father.&#160;<br/>
‘I’m going to stay here,’ said&#160;the old man. ‘I want a bed and&#160;<br/>
food. I like watching the sea&#160;and the ships. You can call me&#160;<br/>Captain.’&#160;<br/>
He&#160;threw some&#160;money&#160;on&#160;the&#160;table. ‘That’s for my bed and my&#160;<br/>
food,’ he said.&#160;<br/>
And so the old captain came to stay with&#160;us. He was always&#160;<br/>
quiet. In the evenings he sat in the inn and in the day he watched&#160;<br/>the sea and the ships.&#160;<br/>
One day he spoke to me. ‘Come&#160;here, boy,’ he said, and he&#160;<br/>
gave me some money. ‘Take&#160;this, and look out for a sailor&#160;&#160;with&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>one leg.’&#160;<br/>
He was afraid of that sailor with&#160;one&#160;leg.&#160;I was afraid&#160;too.&#160;I&#160;<br/>
looked for the man with one leg, but I never saw him.&#160;<br/>
Then winter came, and it was very&#160;cold. My father was ill, and&#160;<br/>
my mother&#160;and I worked very&#160;hard.&#160;<br/>
Early one January morning, the&#160;captain went to the beach. I&#160;<br/>
helped my mother to make the captain’s breakfast. The door&#160;<br/>opened and a man came in. His&#160;face&#160;was very&#160;white and he had&#160;<br/>only three ringers &#160;on &#160;his &#160;left &#160;hand. &#160;I could see that he&#160;was a sailor.&#160;<br/>
&#160;‘Can I help you?’ I asked.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<i>The man looked at the captain's breakfast table. &#160; &#160;</i><br/>
<i>'Is this table for my friend Bill?'</i>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>The man looked at the captain’s&#160;breakfast table. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>‘Is this table for my friend Bill?’ he&#160;asked. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>‘I &#160;don’t know your friend Bill,’ I said. ‘It’s the captain’s table.’ &#160; &#160;<br/>‘The captain?’ &#160;he said. &#160;‘Well,&#160;&#160;they &#160;sometimes &#160;call my friend&#160;<br/>Bill the Captain. Is he here&#160;in the house?’ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>‘No. He’s out,’ I said.&#160;<br/>
The man sat down and waited for&#160;the captain. Then&#160;the captain&#160;<br/>
came into the room. He went&#160;to his table and sat down.&#160;<br/>
‘Bill!’ said the man.&#160;<br/>
The captain turned round quickly. His face went white.&#160;<br/>
Suddenly, he looked old and ill.&#160;<br/>
‘Come, Bill, you know me. You know an old friend, Bill,’ said&#160;<br/>
the man.&#160;<br/>
‘Black Dog!’ said the captain.&#160;<br/>
‘Yes,’ said the man. ‘It’s me,&#160;Black Dog. I wanted to see my&#160;<br/>
old friend Billy.’ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>
‘Well, here I am,’ said the captain. ‘What do you want?’&#160;<br/>
‘I want to talk to you,&#160;Bill,’ Black Dog said.&#160;<br/>
The captain looked at me. ‘Leave&#160;the room, boy,’ he said, ‘and&#160;<br/>
don’t listen at&#160;the door.’&#160;<br/>
They&#160;talked for a&#160;long&#160;time. Then I heard them talking angrily.&#160;<br/>
‘No, no, no!’ said the captain.&#160;There was a fight and then Black&#160;<br/>
Dog ran out&#160;of&#160;the house.&#160;<br/>
The captain’s &#160;face &#160;was white. ‘I must get&#160;out of here!’ he said.&#160;<br/>
I ran to get him a drink. I&#160;came&#160;back and found the captain on&#160;<br/>
the floor. His eyes were closed.&#160;<br/>
Our doctor, Dr Livesey, came&#160;and looked at the old captain.&#160;<br/>
‘He’s very ill,’ said the doctor.&#160;<br/>
The captain opened his eyes and looked at the doctor. ‘Where’s&#160;<br/>
Black Dog?’ he asked. &#160;<br/>
‘There’s no Black Dog here,’&#160;said the doctor. ‘Now, Billy&#160;<br/>
Bones, you must. . .’&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
3&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>‘Billy Bones?’ &#160;said the &#160;captain. &#160;‘My &#160;name’s&#160; not &#160;Billy&#160;<br/>
Bones.’&#160;<br/>
‘Oh?’<i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</i>said the doctor. ‘Oh, yes.&#160;It’s the name of a famous&#160;<br/>
pirate.’&#160;<br/>
We put the old captain in his bed.&#160;‘He must stay in his bed for a&#160;<br/>
week,’ said&#160;the&#160;doctor. ‘He’s very&#160;ill.’&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
At twelve o’clock I went to&#160;see the captain in his room.&#160;<br/>
‘What did<i>&#160;</i>the doctor say?’ he asked. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>‘You must<i>&#160;</i>stay in&#160;bed for&#160;a week,’ I&#160;told him.&#160;<br/>‘Too late!’ he said. ‘You remember Black Dog. He’s a bad&#160;<br/>
man, &#160;but&#160;there are worse men than Black Dog. They want my old&#160;<br/>box. &#160;You must look out&#160;for sailors. You must look out for Flint’s&#160;<br/>men.’&#160;<br/>
Then the captain closed his&#160;eyes.&#160;<br/>But I didn’t look out for&#160;sailors, because my father died that&#160;<br/>
night. I was too sad to&#160;think about the captain.&#160;<br/>
A week later,&#160;the captain came&#160;down and sat&#160;in his usual&#160;chair.&#160;<br/>
I went outside the inn and looked up and down the road. I saw&#160;<br/>another man on the. road. He wore a long black coat and he&#160;<br/>walked very slowly.&#160;<br/>
‘He can’t see,’ I thought.&#160;<br/>The man arrived in front of the&#160;inn and turned his face to me.&#160;&#160;<br/>
‘Can you tell me, please, where I&#160;am?’ I&#160;told him. He listened&#160;<br/>carefully;&#160;<br/>
‘You’re young,’ he said. ‘Take&#160;my hand, my young friend, and&#160;<br/>
take me inside.’&#160;<br/>
He took my hand, He was very&#160;strong. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>‘Now my young friend,’ he said, ‘take me<i>&#160;&#160;</i>to&#160;the&#160;captain.&#160;<br/>
Quickly! I can break your arm.’&#160;<br/>
When the captain saw the man,&#160;he did not move. The man put&#160;<br/>
something into the captain’s&#160;hand and then left the inn.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
<i>‘Now my young friend,’&#160;he said, ‘take me to&#160;the captain. Quickly!&#160;</i><br/>
<i>I can break your arm.’&#160;</i><br/>
<i>&#160;</i><br/>
<i>&#160;</i><br/>
The captain looked at the black paper in his hand. Then he read&#160;<br/>
the words on it.&#160;<br/>
‘Ten o’clock! They’re coming at&#160;ten o’clock,’ he said. ‘We’ve&#160;<br/>
got six hours!’ He tried to&#160;stand up, but he was too ill.&#160;<br/>
I ran for my mother, but it was&#160;too late. When we came back&#160;<br/>
the captain was dead on the floor.&#160;<br/>
<b>♦&#160;</b><br/>
&#160;<br/>My mother and I went to the village, but the people there did&#160;<br/>
not want&#160;to help us. They were&#160;too afraid. Our friend the doctor&#160;<br/>was away. Nobody could help us.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
5&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>‘I must get my money from the captain’s box,’ my mother&#160;said.&#160;<br/>
‘It’s our &#160;money.’ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>
We opened the box. There were some old coats and shirts and a&#160;<br/>
bag of&#160;money. My&#160;mother began to take the money.&#160;<br/>
‘Quickly!’ I said. ‘It’s&#160;nearly ten o’clock.’&#160;<br/>
It was a cold night, and very&#160;quiet. Suddenly,&#160;I heard a sound&#160;<br/>
on the road. Then I heard someone stop outside the inn. We&#160;<br/>waited, but then everything was&#160;quiet again. Nothing moved.&#160;<br/>
‘Quickly, mother!’ I said. ‘Take all the captain’s money.’&#160;<br/>
‘No,’ she said. ‘I don’t want&#160;it all.’ Then we heard someone&#160;<br/>
again, outside the front door.&#160;<br/>
‘Let’s go without the money,’&#160;my mother said.&#160;<br/>
I took an envelope from the captain’s box. ‘I’m&#160;going to take&#160;<br/>
this,’ I said.&#160;<br/>
We&#160;left the&#160;inn&#160;very&#160;quietly&#160;through the back door. We heard&#160;<br/>
men running along the road to the inn.&#160;<br/>
We stopped behind some trees and watched the men. There&#160;<br/>
were&#160;seven or eight of them, all pirates. They broke down the&#160;<br/>door&#160;of&#160;the inn and ran inside.&#160;<br/>
‘Bill’s dead!’ someone said.&#160;<br/>
‘Open his box!’ a second man said.&#160;<br/>
‘The money’s here!’&#160;<br/>
‘Flint’s map! Where’s Flint’s map?’&#160;<br/>
‘We can’t find it!’&#160;<br/>
‘It’s not here!’&#160;<br/>
‘It’s those people at the inn -&#160;it’s that boy! The boy’s got the&#160;<br/>
map. Find them, boys!’&#160;<br/>
The men moved quickly.&#160;They looked into&#160;every room in&#160;the&#160;<br/>
inn.&#160;<br/>
<i>‘</i>Listen!’ one of&#160;them said. ‘Someone’s coming! We must run!’&#160;<br/>
‘No, find the boy! He’s near&#160;here somewhere, I know.’&#160;<br/>
Then I heard a gun. The pirates heard it too,&#160;and began to run&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>We stopped behind some trees and watched the men.&#160;</i><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a>away. We&#160;waited for&#160;a minute or&#160;two and then we&#160;went back to&#160;<br/>the inn.&#160;<br/>
‘What did the pirates want?’ a&#160;man from the village asked me.&#160;<br/>
‘Did they find the captain’s&#160;money?’&#160;<br/>
‘Yes,’ I said. ‘But I think they&#160;wanted this.’ I showed him the&#160;<br/>
envelope. ‘I think there’s a map inside it.’&#160;<br/>
‘You must take it to Mr&#160;Trelawney,’ he told me.&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
When I arrived at Mr Trelawney’s house, Dr Livesey was there.&#160;<br/>
‘Hello&#160;Jim, what is it?’&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>I told&#160;him&#160;about the pirates.&#160;<br/>‘Let’s see that map,’ the doctor&#160;said. ‘But first, Mr Trelawney,&#160;<br/>
what do you know about&#160;Captain Flint?’&#160;<br/>
‘Flint?’ said Mr Trelawney. ‘He&#160;was a famous pirate and a very&#160;<br/>
bad man. Everybody was afraid of&#160;Captain Flint. But he’s dead&#160;<br/>now.’&#160;<br/>
‘Did he have any money?’ asked the doctor.&#160;<br/>‘Money!’ said Mr Trelawney. ‘He&#160;was the richest pirate&#160;in&#160;the&#160;<br/>
West Indies.’&#160;<br/>
‘Then perhaps this map shows where Captain Flint’s treasure&#160;<br/>
is,’ said the doctor.&#160;<br/>
‘What?’ said Mr Trelawney. ‘Then I must buy a ship and we&#160;<br/>
can all go and look for the treasure.’&#160;<br/>
The doctor opened the map very carefully. It was a map of an&#160;<br/>
island. There was some writing on&#160;the map. It said: ‘Treasure&#160;<br/>here’.&#160;<br/>
Mr Trelawney and the doctor were&#160;excited. ‘Livesey!’ said Mr&#160;<br/>
Trelawney. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to&#160;Bristol. I’m going to buy a&#160;<br/>ship and find sailors. Jim, you&#160;and Dr Livesey are going to come&#160;<br/>with me to look for the treasure!’&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

Treasure Island 1750&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The next&#160;day Mr Trelawney left for Bristol. I stayed at home and&#160;<br/>waited. At last, weeks later, Dr&#160;Livesey got a letter from Bristol.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Dear Livesey,&#160;<br/>
<i>The ship is ready. Its name is Hispaniola. I found a good man to be&#160;</i><br/>
<i>our cook on the ship. He’s an old sailor and he has an inn here in&#160;<br/>Bristol.&#160;He&#160;is&#160;going&#160;to&#160;help&#160;me&#160;find&#160;sailors for our ship. He&#160;knows a lot&#160;<br/>of men&#160;here. His name is Long&#160;John Silver. He has only one leg.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Please send Jim Hawkins to Bristol&#160;tomorrow. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Trelawney.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>&#160;</i><br/>
I was very&#160;excited. The next&#160;morning I said goodbye to my&#160;<br/>mother and started for Bristol.&#160;Mr Trelawney met me there.&#160;<br/>
‘When do we sail?’ I asked him.&#160;<br/>
‘Sail?’ he said. ‘We sail tomorrow!’&#160;<br/>
I had something to eat, then Mr&#160;Trelawney gave me a letter for&#160;<br/>
Long John Silver at&#160;the Spy&#160;Glass Inn.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
9&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a>There were a lot of sailors in the Spy Glass Inn. I looked round&#160;<br/>
and saw a tall strong man with one leg. ‘He’s Long John Silver,’ I&#160;<br/>thought.&#160;<br/>
‘Mr Silver, sir?’ I asked.&#160;<br/>
‘Yes, that’s my name. And who are you?’&#160;<br/>
I gave him the letter and he took&#160;my hand. Suddenly, one of the&#160;<br/>
other men in the inn jumped up and&#160;ran to the door. I knew him. It&#160;<br/>was Black Dog!&#160;<br/>
‘Stop him!’ I said. ‘Stop him! It’s Black Dog!’ ‘Harry,’ said&#160;<br/>
Silver, ‘run and catch that man.’&#160;A man got up and ran after Black&#160;<br/>Dog.&#160;<br/>
Long John Silver turned to me.&#160;“Who was that man?’ he asked.&#160;<br/>
‘Black what?’&#160;<br/>
‘Dog, sir,’ I said. ‘He’s a pirate.’&#160;<br/>
‘A pirate!’ said Silver. ‘Ben, run and help&#160;Harry. You can catch&#160;<br/>
him!’&#160;<br/>
But Ben and Harry came back&#160;without Black Dog. ‘We lost&#160;<br/>
him,’ they said.&#160;<br/>
‘Well, what is Mr Trelawney going to think?’ said Silver. ‘You&#160;<br/>
know, Jim, we did try to catch&#160;him. And nobody in the inn knew&#160;<br/>that he was the pirate&#160;Black Dog. Now, Jim, come with&#160;me.&#160;<br/>We’re going to see Mr Trelawney.’&#160;<br/>
Long John Silver walked with&#160;me to meet Mr Trelawney and&#160;<br/>
Dr Livesey. He told&#160;them about&#160;Black Dog.&#160;<br/>
Mr Trelawney listened carefully, and&#160;then said, ‘Well, we can’t&#160;<br/>
do anything about Black Dog now.&#160;John, tell all the men to come&#160;<br/>to&#160;the&#160;ship&#160;this afternoon.’&#160;<br/>
The doctor turned to me. ‘Come and see the ship, Jim,’ he said.&#160;<br/>
And meet our captain, Captain Smollett.’&#160;<br/>
So&#160;&#160;we&#160;&#160;went&#160;&#160;to&#160;&#160;the<i>&#160;Hispaniola.&#160;</i>‘Well, Captain Smollett,’ said&#160;<br/>
Mr Trelawney, ‘I hope&#160;everything is ready.’&#160;<br/>
‘Well, sir,’ said the captain, ‘it is, but I’m not happy about it. I&#160;<br/>
don’t like the sailors.’&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
10&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>Long John Silver turned to me. ‘Who was that&#160;man?’ he &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>asked. ‘Black what?’&#160;</i><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=14></a>‘Oh?’ said Mr Trelawney. He&#160;was very angry with the captain.&#160;<br/>
But&#160;Dr Livesey said, ‘Tell me, Captain Smollett. Why are you&#160;<br/>unhappy? &#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
‘Well,’ said the captain, I don’t know where we are going. But&#160;<br/>all the sailors say we are going to&#160;look for treasure. I don’t like&#160;<br/>
it. I don’t&#160;know these men.’&#160;<br/>
‘Well, what do you want?’ asked the doctor.&#160;<br/>‘We must have all the guns in&#160;our rooms,&#160;sir. And Mr&#160;<br/>
Trelawney’s men must&#160;sleep near&#160;us, not with the other sailors.’&#160;<br/>
‘And?’ said Mr Trelawney.&#160;<br/>‘You have a map. The sailors know about it. Nobody must see&#160;<br/>
that map.’ &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>
‘Right, sir,’ said Mr Trelawney. ‘We can do that. But I think&#160;<br/>
they’re very good men.’&#160;<br/>
‘Trelawney,’ said the doctor&#160;later, ‘you have two good men,&#160;<br/>
Captain Smollett&#160;and Long John Silver.’&#160;<br/>
‘I don’t know about the captain,’ said Mr&#160;Trelawney angrily.&#160;<br/>Then Captain Smollett found me. ‘And you, boy, go and help&#160;<br/>
the cook!’&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>We worked all night and in the morning, the ship left Bristol.&#160;<br/>
The&#160;<i>Hispaniola&#160;</i>was a good ship and we&#160;had good weather. The&#160;<br/>sailors all liked Long John Silver. In&#160;the old days, before he lost his&#160;<br/>leg, he was a good fighter,’ some of&#160;them said. He&#160;was always very&#160;<br/>good to me.&#160;<br/>
Mr Trelawney liked to give the&#160;sailors things to make them&#160;<br/>
happy. There was&#160;always a big barrel&#160;of fruit for them.&#160;<br/>
One night, after I finished my work&#160;on the ship, I went to get&#160;<br/>
some fruit from the barrel. Everything was very quiet. I climbed&#160;<br/>inside the barrel to get the fruit. Suddenly a heavy man sat down&#160;<br/>next to the barrel. He began to speak. It was Long John Silver. I&#160;<br/>stayed very quiet.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
12&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=15></a>‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Flint was our captain. I&#160;sailed with&#160;him many&#160;<br/>
times. We&#160;had one big fight. I&#160;lost&#160;my leg and Old Pew lost&#160;his&#160;<br/>eyes. I saw a lot of fighting&#160;and a lot of treasure, too.’&#160;<br/>
‘Ah,’ said a younger man. ‘Flint was a bad man! And where are&#160;<br/>
all Flint’s men now?’&#160;<br/>
‘Most of&#160;them are here,’ said Silver quietly, ‘on this ship. Old&#160;<br/>
Pew’s dead. And you, young man,&#160;do you want to help&#160;us? Do&#160;<br/>you want&#160;to be a pirate?’&#160;<br/>
‘Yes I do.’&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
‘Good,’ said Silver. ‘You’re&#160;going to be a good pirate.’&#160;<br/>Then a second man spoke&#160;to Long John Silver. It was Israel&#160;<br/>
Hands.&#160;<br/>
‘I don’t like our captain, John,’&#160;he said. ‘Let’s kill Smollett and&#160;<br/>
the others.’&#160;<br/>
‘No. We must wait. We must have Captain Smollett to sail the&#160;<br/>
ship,’ said Silver. ‘And Mr&#160;Trelawney and the doctor have the&#160;<br/>map. Let them find the treasure&#160;first. Then we can kill them. Now&#160;<br/>get&#160;me some fruit from this barrel.’&#160;<br/>
I was very&#160;afraid. But then someone said, ‘Land!’&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>Everybody ran to see the island.&#160;I waited for a minute, then I&#160;<br/>
climbed out of the barrel and ran, too. The ship was now quite&#160;<br/>near an island.&#160;<br/>
‘Does anybody know this island?’ Captain Smollett asked.&#160;<br/>‘I do,’ said Silver. ‘There were&#160;a lot of pirates here in the old&#160;<br/>
days. That hill in the centre of the island is called the Spy Glass.’&#160;<br/>
Then Captain Smollett showed Silver a map of the island.&#160;<br/>
Silver looked at the map very&#160;carefully, but it was not Billy&#160;<br/>Bones’s map. It did not&#160;show the treasure.&#160;<br/>
I went to&#160;Dr Livesey. ‘Can I speak to you please, doctor?’&#160;I&#160;<br/>
said.&#160;<br/>
‘What is it, Jim?’ he asked.&#160;<br/>
13&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a>Then I told the doctor, Mr Trelawney and Captain Smollett&#160;<br/>
about Long John Silver. ‘Most of the&#160;sailors are&#160;pirates,’ I said.&#160;<br/>‘They want to kill us and take the treasure.’&#160;<br/>
‘Thank you, Jim,’ said Mr Trelawney. ‘And Captain Smollett,&#160;<br/>
you were right. I was wrong. I’m sorry.’&#160;<br/>
‘Silver&#160;is&#160;a very&#160;clever man,’ said the doctor. We all liked him.’&#160;<br/>‘What are we going to do, captain?’&#160;asked Mr Trelawney.&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>The next morning we arrived at&#160;the island. I remembered Billy&#160;<br/>
Bones’s map. ‘I know there’s a house&#160;on the island,’ I thought.&#160;<br/>‘But I can’t see it from here.’&#160;<br/>
The sailors wanted to leave the&#160;ship, but Captain Smollett said,&#160;<br/>
‘Tell the men they can go to&#160;the island this afternoon.’&#160;<br/>
‘What are we going to&#160;do?’ asked Mr Trelawney. ‘We must&#160;<br/>
think quickly.’&#160;<br/>
Three of the men on the ship, Hunter, Joyce and Redruth, were&#160;<br/>
Mr Trelawney’s men. He told them about Long John Silver and&#160;<br/>the pirates and he gave them some guns.&#160;Then he spoke to the&#160;<br/>other men, the pirates.&#160;<br/>
‘Men,’ he said, ‘it’s a hot day and we’re all&#160;tired. Take a boat&#160;<br/>
and go to the island. You can come back this evening.’&#160;<br/>
The pirates were happier. Six of them stayed on the&#160;<i>Hispaniola&#160;</i><br/>
and thirteen got into the small boats to go to&#160;the&#160;island.&#160;I quietly&#160;<br/>got&#160;into&#160;one of the boats, too.&#160;<br/>
We arrived on the beach and I&#160;ran away from the pirates. Long&#160;<br/>
John&#160;Silver saw&#160;me.&#160;‘Jim! Jim!’&#160;he said. ‘Come here!’ But I did&#160;<br/>not listen to him. I&#160;ran into the trees.&#160;<br/>
I walked about for a time, then&#160;I heard the pirates talking&#160;<br/>
angrily. There was some fighting, and one man died.&#160;<br/>
‘He didn’t want to help them, so&#160;they killed him,’ I thought,&#160;<br/>‘They’re bad men.’&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>‘&#160;<br/>
14&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>&#160;<br/>
<i>‘I know there’s a house on the island,’ I thought. ‘But I can’t</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>see it from here.’</i>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a>I ran and ran. ‘How can I get back&#160;to the ship?’ I thought. ‘The&#160;<br/>
pirates are going to kill me, too.’&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
I climbed the hill. Suddenly I&#160;saw a man. Who’s this?’ I&#160;<br/>
thought. ‘He isn’t one of our men.&#160;Nobody lives on this island.’&#160;<br/>
I began to&#160;run back to the beach, but I was tired and the man&#160;<br/>
ran very&#160;quickly. I&#160;stopped&#160;and took out&#160;my gun.&#160;<br/>
The man carefully came out of&#160;the trees. ‘Who are you?’ I&#160;<br/>
asked.&#160;<br/>
‘I’m Ben Gunn,’ he said. ‘I live here. The pirates left me on this&#160;<br/>
island three years ago.&#160;What’s your name?’&#160;<br/>
‘Jim,’ I told him.&#160;<br/>
‘Well, Jim,’ he said, ‘I’m a very rich man. But tell me, who&#160;<br/>
came in that ship? Is it Flint’s ship?’&#160;<br/>
‘No, it isn’t. Flint is dead,’ I said. ‘But some of his men are on&#160;<br/>
the ship.’&#160;<br/>
‘Not. . . not a man with one leg?’&#160;<br/>
‘Silver?’ I asked.&#160;<br/>
‘Yes, Silver,’ he said. ‘Are you a friend of his?’&#160;<br/>
‘No, I’m not,’ I answered.&#160;And I told him everything.&#160;<br/>
‘Is Mr Trelawney a good man?’&#160;Ben asked. ‘Perhaps I can help&#160;<br/>
him.’&#160;<br/>
‘Yes, he’s very good. And I think he can help&#160;you, too.’&#160;<br/>
‘Good,’ said Ben Gunn.&#160;<br/>
‘But can you help me<i>&#160;&#160;</i>now?’ I asked. ‘I must&#160;get back to the&#160;<br/>
ship.’&#160;<br/>
‘I’ve got a little boat,’ he said.&#160;‘You can use it tonight.’&#160;<br/>
Suddenly we heard the sound&#160;of guns. ‘Listen! they’re&#160;<br/>
fighting!’&#160;I said.&#160;<br/>
We ran to the beach. We heard&#160;more&#160;guns, then everything&#160;<br/>
was quiet and a flag went up above the trees.&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
At half-past one in the afternoon two small boats&#160;went&#160;from the&#160;<br/>
ship to&#160;the&#160;island.&#160;We&#160;looked&#160;for Jim&#160;Hawkins on the&#160;<i>Hispaniola,&#160;<br/></i>but he was not there.&#160;<br/>
We waited on the ship. There were&#160;six pirates with us. Then&#160;<br/>
Hunter and I took a boat and went&#160;to the island. I wanted to see&#160;<br/>the house on the island.&#160;<br/>
The house was strong and it was&#160;in&#160;a good place. ‘We can stay&#160;<br/>
here,’ I thought. ‘There’s water,&#160;and we can bring food and guns&#160;<br/>from the ship.’&#160;<br/>
Then I heard the pirates fighting&#160;in the trees. ‘They’re killing&#160;<br/>
someone,’ I thought. ‘Perhaps&#160;Jim Hawkins is dead.’&#160;<br/>
Hunter and I went back to&#160;the&#160;<i>Hispaniola.&#160;&#160;</i>I told the captain&#160;<br/>
about the house, and we&#160;started to put food&#160;into the small boat.&#160;<br/>The pirates on the ship did not&#160;hear us.&#160;<br/>
Joyce and I carried the&#160;food from the beach&#160;to the house. Joyce&#160;<br/>
stayed in&#160;the house with&#160;his gun&#160;and I&#160;went&#160;back to&#160;the ship. We&#160;<br/>put more food and our guns into&#160;the small boat and dropped all&#160;<br/>the other&#160;guns into&#160;the sea. Then Mr Trelawney’s men Redruth&#160;<br/>and Hunter, Mr Trelawney, the captain and I&#160;left the ship. There&#160;<br/>were five of us&#160;in a small boat and we moved very slowly.&#160;<br/>
Then we saw the pirates on the&#160;<i>Hispaniola.&#160;&#160;</i>They had the big&#160;<br/>
gun on the ship.&#160;<br/>
‘They’re going to&#160;shoot at us,’&#160;somebody said.&#160;<br/>
We tried to go faster. Mr Trelawney shot at the men on the ship.&#160;<br/>
He hit one of them.&#160;<br/>
Then the pirates on the island ran out of the trees. They began&#160;<br/>
to run along the beach.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<i>Captain Smollett said sadly,&#160;‘Now there are&#160;only five of us</i>&#160;<br/>
<i>and we&#160;have food for ten days. What are we&#160;going to&#160;do?’</i>&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=23></a>‘Quickly!’ said the captain. ‘They’re going to catch us. Leave&#160;<br/>
the boat.’&#160;<br/>
We heard the big gun on the&#160;<i>Hispaniola&#160;</i>behind us; we jumped&#160;<br/>
on to the beach and ran. Most of our food and our guns went&#160;<br/>down into&#160;the sea&#160;with&#160;the small boat.&#160;<br/>
We heard the pirates&#160;running along the beach behind us, but we&#160;<br/>
ran quickly through the trees to the house. We arrived at the house&#160;<br/>and&#160;turned&#160;to&#160;shoot at&#160;the pirates.&#160;<br/>
We hit one of the pirates, and&#160;the other men ran away. Then one&#160;<br/>
of the pirates turned and shot Redruth through the head.&#160;<br/>
Captain Smollett&#160;said sadly: ‘Now there are only five of&#160;us&#160;and&#160;<br/>
we have food for ten days.&#160;What are we going to&#160;do?’&#160;<br/>
Suddenly we heard somebody outside. ‘Dr Livesey,’ said Jim&#160;<br/>
Hawkins, ‘it’s me, Jim. I’m here.’&#160;<br/>
So then there were six of us.&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>‘Your friends are in the&#160;house now,’ said Ben Gunn.&#160;<br/>
‘I must go &#160;to&#160; &#160;them,’ &#160; I &#160;said. &#160;‘Are &#160;you &#160;&#160;coming &#160;with me?&#160;<br/>
‘No,’ said Ben. ‘But you know where to find me. Come&#160;<br/>
tomorrow afternoon.’&#160;<br/>
I looked at the&#160;<i>Hispaniola,&#160;</i>out on the sea, and saw the pirates’&#160;<br/>
flag. ‘They have the ship now,’ I thought.&#160;<br/>
The pirates on the beach made a&#160;big fire. They started to drink&#160;<br/>
and to talk loudly. I waited for a&#160;time, then went&#160;to the house. I&#160;<br/>told Dr Livesey about my meeting with Ben Gunn up on the&#160;<br/>hill.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
‘Tell me about this man,’ said the doctor. ‘Is he going to help&#160;<br/>
us?’&#160;<br/>
‘Yes, I think he is,’ I said.&#160;<br/>
‘There are fifteen pirates now,’&#160;said&#160;the doctor. ‘And there are&#160;<br/>
six of us. Seven, with Ben Gunn.’&#160;<br/>
I was very tired and I slept well&#160;that night. The next&#160;morning&#160;<br/>
one of our men said: ‘Look! Someone’s coming! A man with&#160;a&#160;<br/>white flag.’&#160;<br/>
‘Don’t shoot!’ said the man. ‘It’s me. John Silver.’ ‘What do&#160;<br/>
you want?’ asked Captain Smollett.&#160;‘Captain Silver wants to talk&#160;<br/>to you,’ said Long John. ‘Captain<i>&#160;&#160;</i>Silver now? Come on, then,’&#160;<br/>said Captain Smollett. Long John&#160;came slowly up the hill to the&#160;<br/>house. We&#160;all watched him.&#160;<br/>
‘Yes?’ asked the captain.&#160;<br/>
One of our men is dead,’ said&#160;Silver. ‘You killed him in the&#160;<br/>
night.’&#160;<br/>
The captain said&#160;nothing.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
‘We didn’t kill that man,’ I thought. ‘Ben Gunn&#160;killed him.&#160;<br/>
Now there are only fourteen pirates.’&#160;<br/>
‘We want that treasure,’ Silver&#160;said. ‘And you’ve got a map,&#160;<br/>
right?’&#160;<br/>
‘Perhaps,’ said the captain.&#160;<br/>
‘I know you’ve got it,’ said Silver. ‘Give us the map. Then you&#160;<br/>
can leave the island with us, or,&#160;if you like, you can stay here.’&#160;<br/>
‘Is that&#160;all?’ asked Captain Smollett. ‘Now, listen to&#160;me, Silver.&#160;<br/>
You can’t find the treasure and you can’t sail the ship. We aren’t&#160;<br/>going to help you find the treasure, so you can go now. I have&#160;<br/>nothing more to say to you.’&#160;<br/>
‘Then we’re going to fight you,’&#160;said Silver angrily, and he&#160;<br/>
went away, walking slowly down the hill.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

23&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=26></a>It was a hot day. We waited for&#160;a long time and then the pirates&#160;<br/>
started shooting again. Suddenly&#160;some&#160;of the pirates ran out of the&#160;<br/>trees up to the house.&#160;<br/>
‘Get them!’ said the captain.&#160;We all fought hard. We killed&#160;<br/>
three of the pirates&#160;and the others ran away. But when we got&#160;<br/>back inside the house we found&#160;that Joyce was dead. Hunter and&#160;<br/>the captain were hurt, too.&#160;<br/>
‘Five pirates are dead,’ said the doctor.&#160;<br/>‘Good,’ said the captain. ‘Now they have nine&#160;men and we have&#160;<br/>
five.’&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The pirates went back to the&#160;beach. Everything was quiet. Later&#160;<br/>that day Hunter died.&#160;<br/>
The doctor left the&#160;house.&#160;‘He’s going to&#160;meet Ben Gunn,’&#160;I&#160;<br/>
thought. It was very&#160;hot&#160;inside the house and I did not&#160;like&#160;<br/>waiting. So I took some food and a&#160;gun and went to look for Ben&#160;<br/>Gunn’s boat.&#160;<br/>
After about an hour I found it.&#160;It was very small and light. ‘I&#160;<br/>
can take this boat&#160;and go out to the&#160;<i>Hispaniola&#160;</i>at night,’&#160;I&#160;<br/>
thought.&#160;<br/>I sat down and waited. Night came, and it was very dark. The&#160;<br/>
pirates had a big fire on the beach, and there was a small light on&#160;<br/>the&#160;<i>Hispaniola.&#160;</i>Very quietly, I put Ben Gunn’s boat&#160;into&#160;the sea.&#160;<br/>The boat&#160;moved slowly&#160;and quietly across the water. Soon I was&#160;<br/>near the ship. Nobody saw me.&#160;<br/>
‘I can cut the ship’s rope with&#160;my knife,’ I thought. ‘And then&#160;<br/>
the wind can push the ship&#160;away from the beach.’&#160;<br/>
I listened. There were two men on&#160;the ship. The other pirates&#160;<br/>
were all on the beach. The men on&#160;the&#160;ship&#160;were&#160;talking loudly&#160;<br/>and angrily. ‘They’re going to have&#160;a fight,’ I thought. One of the&#160;<br/>men was Israel Hands.&#160;<br/>
I waited, then I cut the rope. Slowly&#160;the ship turned round and&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

<a name=27></a>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>‘I can cut the ship’s rope with my knife,’ I thought.&#160;</i><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=28></a>began &#160;to &#160;move &#160;away &#160;from &#160;the beach. &#160;The two&#160;men on the ship&#160;<br/>
started to fight. The pirates on&#160;the beach sat round their fire and&#160;<br/>sang. They did not see the ship&#160;moving away. I sat down in&#160;Ben&#160;<br/>Gunn’s boat and fell asleep.&#160;<br/>
In the morning I sat up and looked around. The little boat was&#160;<br/>
not far from the island and I&#160;saw that I was quite near the&#160;<br/><i>Hispaniola.&#160;&#160;</i>I looked for Israel Hands&#160;and the other&#160;pirate, but I&#160;<br/>did not see them. I moved slowly&#160;nearer and nearer to&#160;the&#160;<br/><i>Hispaniola.&#160;</i>Then I climbed on to the ship.&#160;<br/>
The two pirates were there, on&#160;the ship. They did not&#160;move.&#160;<br/>
One &#160;of &#160;them &#160;was dead. &#160;Israel&#160;Hand’s leg was badly hurt, but&#160;he&#160;<br/>
was not dead.&#160;<br/>
I looked round the ship. All&#160;the cupboards were open, and&#160;<br/>
everything was&#160;dirty. There were&#160;a lot of bottles on the floor.&#160;<br/>
I found&#160;some&#160;drink&#160;and gave it to Hands. Then I took down the&#160;<br/>
pirates’ flag. ‘The ship&#160;is ours, now,’ I thought.&#160;<br/>
Israel Hands spoke. ‘You can’t sail the ship, Jim Hawkins,’ he&#160;<br/>
said. ‘Give me&#160;some food. I can help you.’&#160;<br/>
‘I don’t want to go back to the beach,’ I said. ‘Help me to sail it&#160;<br/>
to&#160;the&#160;North&#160;Inlet.’&#160;<br/>
‘Right,’ he said.&#160;<br/>
So we sailed to the north of the island. The ship moved quietly&#160;<br/>
through the water; I was happy. The old pirate watched me&#160;<br/>carefully.&#160;<br/>
Then he smiled. ‘Jim, go and get me . . . er . . . get me&#160;<br/>
something to&#160;drink,’&#160;he&#160;said. ‘I’m thirsty.’&#160;<br/>
I did not&#160;like his&#160;smile. I&#160;went&#160;away, but I came back very&#160;<br/>
quietly and watched him. He moved&#160;slowly and took a knife from&#160;<br/>behind some rope. Then he put the knife under his&#160;jacket and he&#160;<br/>went back to&#160;his old place.&#160;<br/>
Ah,’ I thought. ‘He can move and he’s got a&#160;knife. He wants to&#160;<br/>
kill me. I must be careful.’&#160;<br/>
I &#160;went back &#160;to &#160;him and gave him the bottle. &#160;We sailed on and&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
26&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=29></a>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<i>So we sailed to the north of&#160;the island. The ship moved &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</i><br/>
<i>quietly through the waters; I was happy.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>&#160;</i><br/>
<i>&#160;</i><br/>
came to the North Inlet. Hands told me what to do and I&#160;<br/>
brought the ship near the beach.&#160;I watched the sails and the sea,&#160;<br/>but I did not watch Hands.&#160;Suddenly I turned and saw him behind&#160;<br/>me with&#160;his knife in his hand.&#160;I jumped away and took out my&#160;<br/>gun. I tried to shoot at Hands&#160;but nothing happened. The gun was&#160;<br/>wet with sea water.&#160;<br/>
I moved away quickly, but&#160;Hands followed me. I climbed up&#160;<br/>
among &#160;the &#160;sails &#160;and tried to shoot again. &#160;Hands&#160;looked up, then&#160;<br/>
he threw his knife at me. It went into my arm. Then I shot him&#160;<br/>and he dropped into the sea.&#160;<br/>
The pirate’s knife was in my&#160;arm. I pulled it out and climbed&#160;<br/>
down on&#160;to&#160;the&#160;ship.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
27&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=30></a>It was now evening. ‘I must&#160;go back to the house now,’ I&#160;<br/>
thought. ‘They’re going to be&#160;angry with me, but I’ve got the&#160;<br/>ship.’&#160;<br/>
So I left the ship and went happily back through the trees. I saw&#160;<br/>
the house, and a big fire next to it.&#160;I moved on quietly through the&#160;<br/>trees and went into the house.&#160;It was dark and very quiet.&#160;<br/>‘Everyone is sleeping,’ I thought.&#160;<br/>
Then &#160;somebody &#160;spoke.&#160; ‘Who’s there?’ &#160;he&#160;said. &#160;It &#160;was Long&#160;<br/>
John Silver.&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Somebody brought a light. There were six pirates in the room.&#160;<br/>The other pirates&#160;were all dead.&#160;<br/>
‘So here’s Jim,’ said Long John Silver. ‘Here to visit&#160;us. That’s&#160;<br/>
very nice ...’&#160;<br/>
I said&#160;nothing.&#160;<br/>‘So now you want&#160;to be a pirate,&#160;Jim,’ Silver said. ‘The captain&#160;<br/>
and the doctor are angry with you, I know.’&#160;<br/>
‘What’s happening?’ I asked.&#160;<br/>‘Well, Jim,’ said Silver. ‘The ship’s far away. Your friends left&#160;<br/>
the house yesterday, and we’re here now. And you, Jim, are you&#160;<br/>going to&#160;stay with&#160;us?’&#160;<br/>
‘Let’s&#160;kill&#160;him,’ said one of the other pirates.&#160;<br/>‘No,’ said Silver. ‘I’m the captain. And I like this boy.’&#160;<br/>The other men were angry&#160;with Silver. They went away to&#160;talk&#160;<br/>
about it together.&#160;<br/>
‘I want to help you, Jim,’ said&#160;Silver quietly to me. ‘But you&#160;<br/>
must help me, too.’&#160;<br/>
At last&#160;the other&#160;pirates&#160;came&#160;back. They gave&#160;Silver some&#160;<br/>
paper. It was black.&#160;<br/>
‘You aren’t our captain &#160;now, John&#160;&#160;Silver,’ &#160; one &#160;of the pirates&#160;<br/>
said. ‘We don’t want you. And we don’t want that&#160;boy.’&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
28&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>‘So here’s Jim. Here to&#160;visit&#160;us. That’s very nice . . .’&#160;</i><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a>‘Well,’ said Silver. ‘I have&#160;something you want. Look! And he&#160;<br/>
showed them Mr Trelawney’s treasure map. ‘The doctor gave me&#160;<br/>this!’ he said.&#160;<br/>
The pirates were very excited and&#160;they all looked at the map.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>‘Good old Silver!’&#160;they said. ‘Good old Captain Silver!’&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The &#160;next &#160;morning &#160;the &#160;doctor &#160;came &#160;to &#160;the &#160;house.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
‘Good &#160;morning, doctor,’ &#160;said Long John. &#160;‘Look who’s &#160;here!’&#160;<br/>‘Jim!’ said the doctor. ‘I want&#160;to&#160;talk to&#160;you.&#160;But first I must&#160;<br/>
look at these men.’&#160;<br/>
‘Now&#160;I want&#160;to&#160;talk&#160;to&#160;Jim,’ said&#160;the doctor&#160;after a&#160;few minutes.&#160;<br/>‘No, you can’t,’ said one pirate.&#160;<br/>But Silver said, ‘Yes, he can. You can speak to the boy, doctor.’&#160;<br/>The doctor turned to me. ‘Why&#160;are you with&#160;the pirates, Jim?’&#160;<br/>
he asked sadly.&#160;<br/>
‘It was a mistake,’ I said. ‘They&#160;caught me here last night. But&#160;<br/>
doctor, I’ve got the ship. It’s in the North Inlet.’&#160;<br/>
‘The ship!’ said the doctor.&#160;<br/>I told&#160;him my story.&#160;<br/>‘Good boy!’ he said. Then he turned to Silver. ‘Silver! Look&#160;<br/>
after this&#160;boy. Perhaps I&#160;can help&#160;you&#160;&#160;later.&#160;&#160;Goodbye,&#160;&#160;Jim.’ &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>And the doctor left us.&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
‘And now, Jim,’ &#160;said Silver,&#160;‘we’re&#160;going&#160;to&#160;look&#160;for the&#160;<br/>treasure.’&#160;<br/>
The pirates thought about the treasure and they were happy.&#160;<br/>
They ate their breakfast quickly and we all started to walk along&#160;<br/>the beach.&#160;<br/>
‘We must go this way, and look&#160;for a tall tree,’ said Silver.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
30&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=33></a>There were a lot of tall trees on&#160;the&#160;island&#160;and&#160;the pirates ran&#160;to&#160;<br/>look at all of them.&#160;<br/>
Then one of the pirates said, ‘Here!’ Near&#160;a tree was a dead&#160;<br/>
man.&#160;<br/>
‘He was a sailor,’ said one of the&#160;pirates. ‘Look at his jacket!&#160;<br/>
But what’s he doing here? When did he die?’&#160;<br/>
‘Flint killed him years ago,’ said&#160;Silver. ‘He’s showing us the&#160;<br/>
way to the treasure. Follow his arm. Come on! This way.’&#160;<br/>
The pirates followed quietly. They were&#160;afraid. We&#160;climbed a&#160;<br/>
hill, then we sat down.&#160;<br/>
Suddenly we heard singing. ‘It’s&#160;Flint!’ said&#160;one man, his face&#160;<br/>
very white. ‘No,’ said Silver. ‘Not Flint. Flint’s dead. Remember&#160;<br/>the treasure, my boys, and don’t be&#160;afraid!’ But all the pirates had&#160;<br/>white faces.&#160;<br/>
Silver listened carefully to the&#160;singing. ‘That’s not Flint!’ he&#160;<br/>
said. &#160;‘It’s . . . it’s &#160;Ben &#160;Gunn! &#160;We’re &#160;not &#160;afraid&#160; of &#160;Ben Gunn!’&#160;<br/>
The singing stopped &#160;and&#160;&#160;we &#160;moved &#160;on. &#160;After twenty minutes&#160;<br/>
we &#160;saw &#160;a very big tree&#160;on top of a hill. The pirates started to run.&#160;<br/>
But they did not find any&#160;treasure. &#160;Under &#160;the&#160;&#160;tree &#160;they &#160;found&#160;<br/>
an old box. There was nothing in it.&#160;Flint’s treasure was not there.&#160;<br/>
For a long time the six pirates sat and said&#160;nothing. Then Silver&#160;<br/>
turned to me. ‘Be very careful,&#160;Jim,’ he said quietly. ‘These men&#160;<br/>are dangerous.’ He gave me a gun.&#160;<br/>
The pirates looked at us and we&#160;looked back at them. Suddenly,&#160;<br/>
from the trees, guns started to shoot. Two of the pirates dropped&#160;<br/>to the ground and the&#160;other three ran away.&#160;<br/>
The doctor and Ben Gunn&#160;ran out of the trees and started to run&#160;<br/>
after the pirates. ‘They can’t get away,’ said Silver. ‘And you,&#160;<br/>Ben Gunn, what are you doing here?’&#160;<br/>
The doctor and Ben told us Ben’s&#160;story. ‘Ben found the treasure&#160;<br/>
a long time ago,’ said the&#160;doctor. ‘He moved it to his&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
31&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=34></a>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>I had a good dinner that&#160;night&#160;with all my friends.&#160;</i><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=35></a>home on the island. So I gave&#160;the pirates Flint’s map and we&#160;<br/>
left the house and went&#160;to&#160;stay with Ben.’&#160;<br/>
We took one of the pirate’s boats, and broke the other. ‘The&#160;<br/>
pirates haven’t got a boat now,’&#160;said the doctor. ‘They can’t&#160;<br/>follow us.’&#160;<br/>
Then we went round the island to find the&#160;<i>Hispaniola.&#160;</i>At last&#160;<br/>
we found our ship and met Mr&#160;Trelawney and Captain Smollett.&#160;<br/>
‘What are you doing here, John&#160;Silver?’ asked the captain.&#160;<br/>‘I’m here to help&#160;you,’ said Silver.&#160;<br/>‘Ah,’ said the captain.&#160;<br/>I had a good dinner that night with all my friends. We were all&#160;<br/>
happy. Silver ate and drank&#160;and smiled and laughed too.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
♦&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>The next morning we started to&#160;carry the treasure&#160;to&#160;the ship.&#160;<br/>
We did not see the three pirates on&#160;the island. Three days later, we&#160;<br/>finished our work. We heard the pirates singing loudly, but we did&#160;<br/>not&#160;see them.&#160;<br/>
We&#160;left some&#160;boxes of&#160;food&#160;for the pirates, and&#160;started&#160;across&#160;<br/>
the sea to&#160;the nearest town. We&#160;were&#160;happy when we arrived&#160;<br/>there. And there Silver&#160;left&#160;us.&#160;We&#160;were&#160;in&#160;the&#160;town and he got&#160;<br/>away. He took some of the&#160;treasure with him, too.&#160;<br/>
And&#160;so, after some&#160;weeks at&#160;sea, we arrived home with&#160;our&#160;<br/>
treasure. I never wanted to go&#160;back to that&#160;island&#160;again.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
