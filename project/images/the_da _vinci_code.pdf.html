The Priory of Sion —a European secret society founded in 1099—is a real organization. In 1975,&#160;<br/>Paris’s Bibliothèque Nationale discovered parchments known as Les Dossiers Secrets, identifying&#160;<br/>numerous members of the Priory of Sion, including Sir Isaac Newton, Botticel&#160;i, Victor Hugo, and&#160;<br/>Leonardo da Vinci.<br/>
The Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei is a deeply devout Catholic group that has been the topic&#160;<br/>of recent controversy due to reports of brain-washing, coercion, and a practice known as “corporal&#160;<br/>mortification.” Opus Dei has just completed construction of a $47 mil&#160;ion National Headquarters at&#160;<br/>243 Lexington Avenue in New York City.<br/>
All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.<br/>
P&#160;R&#160;O&#160;L&#160;O&#160;G&#160;U&#160;E<br/>
Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum’s Grand&#160;<br/>Gal&#160;ery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Carravagio. Grabbing the gilded frame,&#160;<br/>the seventy-three-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wal&#160;&#160;<br/>and Saunière col&#160;apsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.<br/>
As he anticipated, a thundering iron gate fell nearby, barricading the entrance to the suite. The par-<br/>quet floor shook. Far off, an alarm began to ring.&#160;<br/>The curator lay a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock. I am still alive. He crawled out from un-<br/>der the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplace to hide.<br/>&#160;<br/>
A voice spoke, chil&#160;ingly close. “Do not move.”<br/>
&#160;<br/>
On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette of his attacker&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2></a>stared through the iron bars. He was broad and tal&#160;, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair.&#160;<br/>His irises were pink with dark red pupils. The albino drew a pistol from his coat and aimed the long&#160;<br/>silencer through the bars, directly at the curator. “You should not have run.” His accent was not easy&#160;<br/>to place. “Now tell me where it is.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
“I told you already,” the curator stammered, kneeling defenseless on the floor of the gal&#160;ery.&#160;<br/>
“I have no idea what you are talking about!”<br/>&#160;<br/>
“You are lying.” The man stared at him, perfectly immobile except for the glint in his ghostly&#160;<br/>
eyes. “You and your brethren possess something that is not yours.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
The curator felt a surge of adrenalin. &#160;How could he possibly know this?&#160;<br/>
“Tonight the&#160;<br/>
rightful guardians will be restored. Tell me where it is hidden, and you will live.” The man leveled his&#160;<br/>gun at the curator’s head. “Is it a secret you will die for?”&#160;<br/>Saunière could not breathe.&#160;<br/>The man tilted his head and closed one eye, peering down the barrel of his gun.<br/>&#160;<br/>
Saunière held up his hands in defense. “Wait,” he said slowly. “I will tell you what you need to&#160;<br/>
know.” The curator spoke his next words careful&#160;y. The lie he told was one he had rehearsed many&#160;<br/>times.&#160;.each time praying he would never have to use it.&#160;<br/>When the curator had finished speaking, his assailant smiled smugly. “Yes. This is exactly what the&#160;<br/>others told me.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
Saunière&#160;recoiled.&#160;The&#160;others?<br/>
&#160;<br/>
“I found them, too,” the huge man taunted. “All three of them. They confirmed what you&#160;<br/>
have just said.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
It cannot be! The curator’s true identity, along with the identities of his three sénéchaux, was&#160;<br/>
almost as sacred as the ancient secret they protected.<br/>Saunière now realized his sénéchaux, fol&#160;owing strict procedure, had told the same lie before their&#160;<br/>own deaths. It was part of the protocol.<br/>&#160;<br/>
The attacker aimed his gun again. “When you are gone, I will be the only one who knows&#160;<br/>
the&#160;truth.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
The truth. In an instant, the curator grasped the true horror of the situation. If I die, the truth&#160;<br/>
will be lost forever. Instinctively, he tried to scramble for cover.&#160;<br/>The silencer spat, and the curator felt a searing heat as the bul&#160;et lodged in his stomach. He fell for-<br/>ward.&#160;.struggling against the pain. Slowly, Saunière rol&#160;ed over and stared back through the bars at his&#160;<br/>attacker.&#160;<br/>The man was now taking dead aim at Saunière’s head.<br/>&#160;<br/>
Saunière closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret.&#160;&#160;The click of an&#160;<br/>
empty chamber echoed through the corridor.<br/>&#160;<br/>
The curator’s eyes flew open.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3></a>&#160;<br/>
The man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused. He reached for a second clip,&#160;<br/>
but then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at Saunière’s gut. “My work here is done.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
The curator looked down and saw the bul&#160;et hole in his white linen shirt. It was framed by a&#160;<br/>
small circle of blood a few inches below his breastbone. My stomach. Almost cruel&#160;y, the bul&#160;et had&#160;<br/>missed his heart. As a veteran of La Guerre d’Algérie, the curator had witnessed this horribly drawn&#160;<br/>out death before. For fifteen minutes, he would survive as his stomach acids seeped into his chest&#160;<br/>cavity, slowly poisoning him from within.<br/>&#160;<br/>
“Pain is good, monsieur,” the man said.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Then he was gone.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Alone now, Jacques Saunière turned his gaze again to the iron gate. He was trapped, and the&#160;<br/>
doors could not be reopened for at least twenty minutes. By the time anyone got to him, he would&#160;<br/>be dead. Even so, the fear that now gripped him was a fear far greater than that of his own death.&#160;<br/>
I must pass on the secret.<br/>&#160;<br/>
Staggering to his feet, he pictured his three murdered brethren. He thought of the genera-<br/>
tions who had come before them.&#160;.of the mission with which they had all been entrusted.&#160;<br/>An unbroken chain of knowledge.&#160;<br/>Suddenly, now, despite all the precaution.&#160;.despite all the fail safes.&#160;.Jacques Saunière was the only&#160;<br/>remaining link, the sole guardian of one of the most powerful secrets ever kept.&#160;<br/>Shivering, he pul&#160;ed himself to his feet.&#160;<br/>I must find some way.&#160;.&#160;<br/>He was trapped inside the Grand Gal&#160;ery, and there existed only one person on earth to whom he&#160;<br/>could pass the torch. Saunière gazed up at the wal&#160;s of his opulent prison. A col&#160;ection of the world’s&#160;<br/>most famous paintings seemed to smile down on him like old friends.&#160;<br/>Wincing in pain, he summoned all of his faculties and strength. The desperate task before him, he&#160;<br/>knew, would require every remaining second of his life.<br/>
C&#160;h&#160;a&#160;p&#160;t&#160;e&#160;r&#160;&#160;&#160;1<br/>
Robert&#160;Langdon&#160;awoke&#160;slowly.<br/>&#160;<br/>
A telephone was ringing in the darkness-a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled for the bedside&#160;<br/>
lamp and turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush Renaissance bedroom with Louis&#160;<br/>XVI furniture, hand-frescoed wal&#160;s, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.&#160;<br/>Where the hell am I?&#160;<br/>The jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: HOTEL RITZ PARIS.&#160;<br/>Slowly, the fog began to lift.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4></a>&#160;<br/>
Langdon picked up the receiver. “Hel&#160;o?”&#160;<br/>
“Monsieur Langdon?” a man’s voice said. “I hope I have not awoken you?”&#160;<br/>
Dazed, Langdon&#160;<br/>
looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A.M. He had been asleep only an hour, but he felt like the&#160;<br/>dead.&#160;<br/>“This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. He insists it is&#160;<br/>urgent.”&#160;<br/>Langdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.<br/>THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARIS<br/>proudly&#160;presents<br/>an&#160;evening&#160;with&#160;Robert&#160;Langdon<br/>Professor of Religious Symbology, Harvard University<br/>
Langdon groaned. Tonight’s lecture-a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of&#160;<br/>Chartres Cathedral-had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. Most likely,&#160;<br/>some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight.&#160;<br/>“I’m sorry,” Langdon said, “but I’m very tired and-”&#160;<br/>“Mais monsieur,” the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. “Your guest is an&#160;<br/>important man.”&#160;<br/>Langdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a reluc-<br/>tant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon’s visibility had increased a hundred-fold after his&#160;<br/>involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of self-important&#160;<br/>historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.&#160;<br/>“If you would be so kind,” Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite, “could you take the man’s&#160;<br/>name and number, and tell him I’ll try to call him before I leave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you.” He&#160;<br/>hung up before the concierge could protest.&#160;&#160;Sitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest&#160;<br/>Relations Handbook, whose cover boasted: SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUM-<br/>BER AT THE PARIS RITZ. He turned and gazed tiredly into the ful&#160;-length mirror across the room.&#160;<br/>The man staring back at him was a stranger-tousled and weary.&#160;<br/>You need a vacation, Robert.&#160;<br/>The past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn’t appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. His&#160;<br/>usual&#160;y sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw&#160;<br/>and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way deeper&#160;<br/>into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female col&#160;eagues insisted the gray only accentuated&#160;<br/>his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.&#160;<br/>If Boston Magazine could see me now.&#160;<br/>Last month, much to Langdon’s embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him as one of that city’s&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>top ten most intriguing people-a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing by his&#160;<br/>Harvard col&#160;eagues. Tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced to haunt&#160;<br/>him at the lecture he had given.&#160;<br/>“Ladies and gentlemen.&#160;.” the hostess had announced to a full house at The American University of&#160;<br/>Paris’s Pavil&#160;on Dauphine, “Our guest tonight needs no introduction. He is the author of numerous&#160;<br/>books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The Art of the Il&#160;uminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms,&#160;<br/>and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literal&#160;y. Many of you use&#160;<br/>his textbooks in class.”&#160;<br/>The students in the crowd nodded enthusiastical&#160;y.&#160;<br/>“I had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculum vitae. However.&#160;.” She&#160;<br/>glanced playful&#160;y at Langdon, who was seated onstage. “An audience member has just handed me a&#160;<br/>far more, shall we say.&#160;.intriguing introduction.”<br/>She held up a copy of Boston Magazine.v Langdon cringed. Where the hell did she get that?&#160;<br/>The hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdon felt himself sinking&#160;<br/>lower and lower in his chair. Thirty seconds later, the crowd was grinning, and the woman showed&#160;<br/>no signs of letting up. “And Mr. Langdon’s refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last year’s&#160;<br/>Vatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter.” The hostess goaded the crowd.&#160;<br/>“Would you like to hear more?”&#160;<br/>The crowd applauded.&#160;<br/>Somebody stop her, Langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.&#160;<br/>
“Although Professor&#160;<br/>
Langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some of our younger awardees, this forty-six-<br/>year-old academic has more than his share of scholarly al&#160;ure. His captivating presence is punctuated&#160;<br/>by an unusual&#160;y low, baritone speaking voice, which his female students describe as ‘chocolate for the&#160;<br/>ears.’’’&#160;<br/>The hall erupted in laughter.&#160;<br/>Langdon forced an awkward smile. He knew what came next-some ridiculous line about “Harrison&#160;<br/>Ford in Harris tweed”-and because this evening he had figured it was final&#160;y safe again to wear his&#160;<br/>Harris tweed and Burberry turtleneck, he decided to take action.&#160;<br/>“Thank you, Monique,” Langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her away from the podium.&#160;<br/>“Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction.” He turned to the audience with an embarrassed sigh.&#160;<br/>“And if I find which one of you provided that article, I’ll have the consulate deport you.”&#160;<br/>The crowd laughed.&#160;<br/>“Wel&#160;, folks, as you all know, I’m here tonight to talk about the power of symbols.&#160;.”&#160;<br/>
The ringing of Langdon’s hotel phone once again broke the silence.&#160;&#160;Groaning in disbelief, he picked&#160;<br/>up. “Yes?”&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>As expected, it was the concierge. “Mr. Langdon, again my apologies. I am cal&#160;ing to inform you that&#160;<br/>your guest is now en route to your room. I thought I should alert you.”&#160;<br/>Langdon was wide awake now.&#160;<br/>“You sent someone to my room?”&#160;<br/>“I apologize, monsieur, but a man like this.&#160;.I cannot presume the authority to stop him.”&#160;<br/>“Who exactly is he?”&#160;<br/>But the concierge was gone.<br/>Almost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on Langdon’s door.&#160;<br/>Uncertain, Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet. He donned&#160;<br/>the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. “Who is it?”&#160;<br/>“Mr. Langdon? I need to speak with you.” The man’s English was accented-a sharp, authoritative bark.&#160;<br/>“My name is Lieutenant Jérome Col&#160;et. Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire.”&#160;<br/>Langdon paused. The Judicial Police? The DCPJ were the rough equivalent of the U.S. FBI.&#160;<br/>Leaving the security chain in place, Langdon opened the door a few inches. The face staring back at&#160;<br/>him was thin and washed out. The man was exceptional&#160;y lean, dressed in an official-looking blue&#160;<br/>uniform.&#160;<br/>“May I come in?” the agent asked.&#160;<br/>Langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger’s sal&#160;ow eyes studied him. “What is this is al&#160;&#160;<br/>about?”&#160;<br/>“My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter.”&#160;<br/>“Now?” Langdon managed. “It’s after midnight.”&#160;<br/>“Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening? “&#160;<br/>
Langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. He and the revered curator Jacques Saunière had been&#160;<br/>slated to meet for drinks after Langdon’s lecture tonight, but Saunière had never shown up. “Yes.&#160;<br/>How did you know that?”&#160;<br/>“We found your name in his daily planner.”&#160;<br/>“I trust nothing is wrong?”&#160;<br/>The agent gave a dire sigh and slid a Polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door.&#160;<br/>
When Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.&#160;<br/>“This photo was taken less than an hour ago. Inside the Louvre.”&#160;<br/>As Langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave way to a sudden upwel&#160;-<br/>ing of anger. “Who would do this!”&#160;<br/>“We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in&#160;<br/>symbology and your plans to meet with him.”&#160;&#160;Langdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a>with fear. The image was gruesome and profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of&#160;<br/>déjà vu. A little over a year ago, Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar re-<br/>quest for help. Twenty-four hours later, he had almost lost his life inside Vatican City. This photo was&#160;<br/>entirely different, and yet something about the scenario felt disquietingly familiar.&#160;<br/>The agent checked his watch. “My capitaine is waiting, sir.” Langdon barely heard him. His eyes were&#160;<br/>still riveted on the picture. “This symbol here, and the way his body is so oddly.&#160;.”&#160;<br/>“Positioned?” the agent offered.&#160;<br/>Langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. “I can’t imagine who would do this to someone.”&#160;<br/>
The agent looked grim. “You don’t understand, Mr. Langdon. What you see in this photograph.&#160;.” He&#160;<br/>paused. “Monsieur Saunière did that to himself.”<br/>
C&#160;h&#160;a&#160;p&#160;t&#160;e&#160;r&#160;&#160;&#160;2<br/>
One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious brown-<br/>stone residence on Rue la Bruyère. The spiked cilice belt that he wore around his thigh cut into his&#160;<br/>flesh, and yet his soul sang with satisfaction of service to the Lord.&#160;<br/>Pain is good.&#160;<br/>His red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. Empty. He climbed the stairs quietly,&#160;<br/>not wanting to awaken any of his fel&#160;ow numeraries. His bedroom door was open; locks were for-<br/>bidden here. He entered, closing the door behind him.&#160;<br/>The room was spartan-hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the corner that served as&#160;<br/>his bed. He was a visitor here this week, and yet for many years he had been blessed with a similar&#160;<br/>sanctuary in New York City.&#160;<br/>The Lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life.&#160;<br/>Tonight, at last, Silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. Hurrying to the dresser, he found the cel&#160;&#160;<br/>phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call to a private extension.&#160;<br/>“Yes?” a male voice answered.&#160;<br/>“Teacher, I have returned.”&#160;<br/>“Speak,” the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.&#160;<br/>“All four are gone. The three sénéchaux.&#160;.and the grandmaster himself.”&#160;<br/>There was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. “Then I assume you have the information?”&#160;<br/>“All four concurred. Independently.”&#160;<br/>“And you believed them?”&#160;<br/>“Their agreement was too great for coincidence.”&#160;<br/>An excited breath. “Superb. I had feared the brotherhood’s reputation for secrecy might prevail.”&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>“The prospect of death is strong motivation.”&#160;<br/>“So, my pupil, tell me what I must know.”&#160;<br/>Silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. “Teacher, all four&#160;<br/>confirmed the existence of the clef de voûte.&#160;.the legendary keystone.”&#160;<br/>He heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the Teacher’s excitement. “The&#160;<br/>keystone. Exactly as we suspected.”&#160;<br/>According to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone-a clef de voûte.&#160;.or keystone—an&#160;<br/>engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood’s greatest secret.&#160;.information&#160;<br/>so powerful that its protection was the reason for the brotherhood’s very existence.<br/>&#160;<br/>
“When we possess the keystone,” the Teacher said, “we will be only one step away.”&#160;<br/>
“We are closer than you think. The keystone is here in Paris.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
“Paris? Incredible. It is almost too easy.”&#160;<br/>
Silas relayed the earlier events of the evening.&#160;.how all four of his victims, moments before death, had&#160;<br/>desperately tried to buy back their Godless lives by tel&#160;ing their secret. Each had told Silas the exact&#160;<br/>same thing-that the keystone was ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of Paris’s ancient&#160;<br/>churches—Eglise&#160;de&#160;Saint-Sulpice.<br/>“Inside a House of the Lord,” the Teacher exclaimed. “How they mock us!”&#160;&#160;“As they have for cen-<br/>turies.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
The Teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle over him. Final&#160;y, he&#160;<br/>
spoke. “You have done a great service to God. We have waited centuries for this. You must retrieve&#160;<br/>the stone for me. Immediately. Tonight. You understand the stakes.”&#160;<br/>Silas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the Teacher was now commanding seemed&#160;<br/>impossible. “But the church, it is a fortress. Especial&#160;y at night. How will I enter?” With the confident&#160;<br/>tone of man of enormous influence, the Teacher explained what was to be done.<br/>
When Silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.&#160;<br/>One hour, he told himself, grateful that the Teacher had given him time to carry out the necessary&#160;<br/>penance before entering a house of God. I must purge my soul of today’s sins. The sins committed&#160;<br/>today had been Holy in purpose. Acts of war against the enemies of God had been committed for&#160;<br/>centuries. Forgiveness was assured.&#160;<br/>Even so, Silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.&#160;<br/>Pul&#160;ing his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room. Looking down, he exam-<br/>ined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. All true fol&#160;owers of The Way wore this device-a&#160;<br/>leather strap, studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual reminder of&#160;<br/>Christ’s suffering. The pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of the flesh.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=9></a>Although Silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite two hours, he knew today&#160;<br/>was no ordinary day. Grasping the buckle, he cinched it one notch tighter, wincing as the barbs dug&#160;<br/>deeper into his flesh. Exhaling slowly, he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.&#160;<br/>Pain is good, Silas whispered, repeating the sacred mantra of Father Josemaria Escriva-the Teacher&#160;<br/>of all Teachers. Although Escriva had died in 1975, his wisdom lived on, his words still whispered by&#160;<br/>thousands of faithful servants around the globe as they knelt on the floor and performed the sacred&#160;<br/>practice known as “corporal mortification.”&#160;<br/>Silas turned his attention now to a heavy knotted rope coiled neatly on the floor beside him. The&#160;<br/>Discipline. The knots were caked with dried blood. Eager for the purifying effects of his own agony,&#160;<br/>Silas said a quick prayer. Then, gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung it hard&#160;<br/>over his shoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. He whipped it over his shoulder again, slash-<br/>ing at his flesh. Again and again, he lashed.&#160;<br/>Castigo corpus meum.&#160;<br/>Final&#160;y, he felt the blood begin to flow.<br/>
c&#160;h&#160;a&#160;p&#160;t&#160;e&#160;r&#160;&#160;&#160;3<br/>
The crisp April air whipped through the open window of the Citroën ZX as it skimmed south past&#160;<br/>the Opera House and crossed Place Vendôme. In the passenger seat, Robert Langdon felt the city&#160;<br/>tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. His quick shower and shave had left him looking&#160;<br/>reasonably presentable but had done little to ease his anxiety. The frightening image of the curator’s&#160;<br/>body remained locked in his mind.&#160;<br/>Jacques Saunière is dead.&#160;<br/>Langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator’s death. Despite Saunière’s&#160;<br/>reputation for being reclusive, his recognition for dedication to the arts made him an easy man to&#160;<br/>revere. His books on the secret codes hidden in the paintings of Poussin and Teniers were some of&#160;<br/>Langdon’s favorite classroom texts. Tonight’s meeting had been one Langdon was very much looking&#160;<br/>forward to, and he was disappointed when the curator had not shown.&#160;<br/>Again the image of the curator’s body flashed in his mind. Jacques Saunière did that to himself? Lang-<br/>don turned and looked out the window, forcing the picture from his mind.&#160;<br/>Outside, the city was just now winding down-street vendors wheeling carts of candied amandes,&#160;<br/>waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of late night lovers cuddling to stay warm in a&#160;<br/>breeze scented with juniper blossom. The Citroën navigated the chaos with authority, its dissonant&#160;<br/>two-tone siren parting the traffic like a knife.&#160;<br/>“Le capitaine was pleased to discover you were still in Paris tonight,” the agent said, speaking for the&#160;<br/>first time since they’d left the hotel. “A fortunate coincidence.”&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a>Langdon was feeling anything but fortunate, and coincidence was a concept he did not entirely trust.&#160;<br/>As someone who had spent his life exploring the hidden interconnectivity of disparate emblems and&#160;<br/>ideologies, Langdon viewed the world as a web of profoundly intertwined histories and events. The&#160;<br/>connections may be invisible, he often preached to his symbology classes at Harvard, but they are&#160;<br/>always there, buried just beneath the surface.&#160;<br/>“I assume,” Langdon said, “that American University in Paris told you where I was staying?”&#160;<br/>The driver shook his head. “Interpol.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
Interpol, Langdon thought. Of course. He had forgotten that the seemingly innocuous&#160;<br/>
request of all European hotels to see a passport at check-in was more than a quaint formality-it&#160;<br/>was the law. On any given night, all across Europe, Interpol officials could pinpoint exactly who was&#160;<br/>sleeping where. Finding Langdon at the Ritz had probably taken all of five seconds.&#160;<br/>As the Citroën accelerated southward across the city, the il&#160;uminated profile of the Eiffel Tower ap-<br/>peared, shooting skyward in the distance to the right. Seeing it, Langdon thought of Vittoria, recal&#160;ing&#160;<br/>their playful promise a year ago that every six months they would meet again at a different romantic&#160;<br/>spot on the globe. The Eiffel Tower, Langdon suspected, would have made their list. Sadly, he last&#160;<br/>kissed Vittoria in a noisy airport in Rome more than a year ago.&#160;<br/>“Did you mount her?” the agent asked, looking over.&#160;<br/>Langdon glanced up, certain he had misunderstood. “I beg your pardon?”&#160;<br/>“She is lovely, no?” The agent motioned through the windshield toward the Eiffel Tower.&#160;<br/>“Have you mounted her?”&#160;<br/>Langdon rol&#160;ed his eyes. “No, I haven’t climbed the tower.”&#160;<br/>“She is the symbol of France. I think she is perfect.” Langdon nodded absently. Symbologists often&#160;<br/>remarked that France-a country renowned for machismo, womanizing, and diminutive insecure&#160;<br/>leaders like Napoleon and Pepin the Short-could not have chosen a more apt national emblem than&#160;<br/>a thousand-foot phal&#160;us.&#160;<br/>
When they reached the intersection at Rue de Rivoli, the traffic light was red, but the Citroën didn’t&#160;<br/>slow. The agent gunned the sedan across the junction and sped onto a wooded section of Rue Cas-<br/>tiglione, which served as the northern entrance to the famed Tuileries Gardens-Paris’s own version&#160;<br/>of Central Park. Most tourists mistranslated Jardins des Tuileries as relating to the thousands of tulips&#160;<br/>that bloomed here, but Tuileries was actual&#160;y a literal reference to something far less romantic. This&#160;<br/>park had once been an enormous, pol&#160;uted excavation pit from which Parisian contractors mined&#160;<br/>clay to manufacture the city’s famous red roofing tiles-or tuiles.&#160;<br/>As they entered the deserted park, the agent reached under the dash and turned off the blaring&#160;<br/>siren. Langdon exhaled, savoring the sudden quiet. Outside the car, the pale wash of halogen head-<br/>lights skimmed over the crushed gravel parkway, the rugged whirr of the tires intoning a hypnotic&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=11></a>rhythm. Langdon had always considered the Tuileries to be sacred ground. These were the gardens&#160;<br/>in which Claude Monet had experimented with form and color, and literal&#160;y inspired the birth of the&#160;<br/>Impressionist movement. Tonight, however, this place held a strange aura of foreboding.<br/>The Citroën swerved left now, angling west down the park’s central boulevard. Curling around a&#160;<br/>circular pond, the driver cut across a desolate avenue out into a wide quadrangle beyond. Langdon&#160;<br/>could now see the end of the Tuileries Gardens, marked by a giant stone archway.&#160;<br/>Arc du Carrousel.&#160;<br/>Despite the orgiastic rituals once held at the Arc du Carrousel, art aficionados revered this place for&#160;<br/>another reason entirely. From the esplanade at the end of the Tuileries, four of the finest art muse-<br/>ums in the world could be seen.&#160;.one at each point of the compass.&#160;<br/>Out the right-hand window, south across the Seine and Quai Voltaire, Langdon could see the&#160;<br/>dramatical&#160;y lit façade of the old train station—now the esteemed Musée d’Orsay. Glancing left, he&#160;<br/>could make out the top of the ultra-modern Pompidou Center, which housed the Museum of Mod-<br/>ern Art. Behind him to the west, Langdon knew the ancient obelisk of Ramses rose above the trees,&#160;<br/>marking the Musée Jeu de Paume.&#160;<br/>But it was straight ahead, to the east, through the archway, that Langdon could now see the mono-<br/>lithic Renaissance palace that had become the most famous art museum in the world.<br/>Musée du Louvre.<br/>&#160;<br/>
Langdon felt a familiar tinge of wonder as his eyes made a futile attempt to absorb the entire&#160;<br/>
mass of the edifice. Across a staggeringly expansive plaza, the imposing facade of the Louvre rose&#160;<br/>like a citadel against the Paris sky. Shaped like an enormous horseshoe, the Louvre was the longest&#160;<br/>building in Europe, stretching farther than three Eiffel Towers laid end to end. Not even the mil&#160;ion&#160;<br/>square feet of open plaza between the museum wings could chal&#160;enge the majesty of the façade’s&#160;<br/>breadth. Langdon had once walked the Louvre’s entire perimeter, an astonishing three-mile journey.&#160;<br/>
Despite the estimated five days it would take a visitor to properly appreciate the 65,300 pieces of&#160;<br/>art in this building, most tourists chose an abbreviated experience Langdon referred to as “Louvre&#160;<br/>Lite”-a full sprint through the museum to see the three most famous objects: The Mona Lisa, Venus&#160;<br/>de Milo, and Winged Victory. Art Buchwald had once boasted he’d seen all three masterpieces in&#160;<br/>five minutes and fifty-six seconds.<br/>&#160;<br/>
The driver pul&#160;ed out a handheld walkie-talkie and spoke in rapid-fire French. “Monsieur&#160;<br/>
Langdon est arrivé. Deux minutes.”&#160;<br/>An indecipherable confirmation came crackling back.&#160;<br/>The agent stowed the device, turning now to Langdon. “You will meet the capitaine at the main&#160;<br/>entrance.”&#160;<br/>The driver ignored the signs prohibiting auto traffic on the plaza, revved the engine, and gunned the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a>Citroën up over the curb. The Louvre’s main entrance was visible now, rising boldly in the distance,&#160;<br/>encircled by seven triangular infinity pools from which spouted il&#160;uminated fountains.&#160;<br/>La Pyramide.&#160;<br/>The new entrance to the Paris Louvre had become almost as famous as the museum itself. The&#160;<br/>controversial, neo-modern glass pyramid designed by Chinese-born American architect I. M. Pei&#160;<br/>still evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt it destroyed the dignity of the Renaissance courtyard.&#160;<br/>Goethe had described architecture as frozen music, and Pei’s critics described this pyramid as fin-<br/>gernails on a chalkboard. Progressive admirers, though, hailed Pei’s seventy-one-foot tal&#160;, transparent&#160;<br/>pyramid as a dazzling synergy of ancient structure and modern method-a symbolic link between the&#160;<br/>old and new—helping usher the Louvre into the next mil&#160;ennium.&#160;<br/>“Do you like our pyramid?” the agent asked.&#160;<br/>Langdon frowned. The French, it seemed, loved to ask Americans this. It was a loaded question, of&#160;<br/>course. Admitting you liked the pyramid made you a tasteless American, and expressing dislike was&#160;<br/>an insult to the French.&#160;<br/>“Mitterrand was a bold man,” Langdon replied, splitting the difference. The late French president&#160;<br/>who had commissioned the pyramid was said to have suffered from a “Pharaoh-complex.” Sin-<br/>gle-handedly responsible for fil&#160;ing Paris with Egyptian obelisks, art, and artifacts, Francois Mitterrand&#160;<br/>had an affinity for Egyptian culture that was so al&#160;-consuming that the French still referred to him as&#160;<br/>The Sphinx.&#160;&#160;“What is the captain’s name?” Langdon asked, changing topics.&#160;<br/>“Bezu Fache,” the driver said, approaching the pyramid’s main entrance. “We call him Le Taureau.”<br/>&#160;<br/>
Langdon glanced over at him, wondering if every Frenchman had a mysterious animal epi-<br/>
thet. “You call your captain The Bul&#160;?”&#160;<br/>The man arched his eyebrows. “Your French is better than you admit, Monsieur Langdon.”&#160;<br/>My French stinks, Langdon thought, but my zodiac iconography is pretty good. Taurus was always the&#160;<br/>bul&#160;. Astrology was a symbolic constant all over the world.<br/>The agent pul&#160;ed the car to a stop and pointed between two fountains to a large door in the side of&#160;<br/>the pyramid. “There is the entrance. Good luck, monsieur.”&#160;&#160;“You’re not coming?”<br/>“My orders are to leave you here. I have other business to attend to.”&#160;Langdon heaved a sigh and&#160;<br/>climbed out. &#160;It’s your circus.&#160;<br/>The agent revved his engine and sped off.&#160;<br/>&#160; &#160;<br/>As Langdon stood alone and watched the departing tail lights, he realized he could easily reconsider,&#160;<br/>exit the courtyard, grab a taxi, and head home to bed. Something told him it was probably a lousy&#160;<br/>idea.&#160;<br/>As he moved toward the mist of the fountains, Langdon had the uneasy sense he was crossing an&#160;<br/>imaginary threshold into another world. The dreamlike quality of the evening was settling around&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a>him again. Twenty minutes ago he had been asleep in his hotel room. Now he was standing in front&#160;<br/>of a transparent pyramid built by The Sphinx, waiting for a policeman they cal&#160;ed The Bul&#160;.&#160;<br/>I’m trapped in a Salvador Dali painting, he thought.&#160;<br/>Langdon strode to the main entrance-an enormous revolving door. The foyer beyond was dimly lit&#160;<br/>and deserted.&#160;<br/>Do I knock?&#160;<br/>Langdon wondered if any of Harvard’s revered Egyptologists had ever knocked on the front door of&#160;<br/>a pyramid and expected an answer. He raised his hand to bang on the glass, but out of the darkness&#160;<br/>below, a figure appeared, striding up the curving staircase. The man was stocky and dark, almost&#160;<br/>Neanderthal, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. He&#160;<br/>advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. He was speaking on his cell phone&#160;<br/>but finished the call as he arrived. He motioned for Langdon to enter.&#160;<br/>“I am Bezu Fache,” he announced as Langdon pushed through the revolving door. “Captain of the&#160;<br/>Central Directorate Judicial Police.” His tone was fitting-a guttural rumble.&#160;.like a gathering storm.&#160;<br/>
Langdon held out his hand to shake. “Robert Langdon.”&#160;<br/>Fache’s enormous palm wrapped around Langdon’s with crushing force.<br/>“I saw the photo,” Langdon said. “Your agent said Jacques Saunière himself did—”&#160;<br/>“Mr. Langdon,” Fache’s ebony eyes locked on. “What you see in the photo is only the beginning of&#160;<br/>what Saunière did.”<br/>
c&#160;h&#160;a&#160;p&#160;t&#160;e&#160;r&#160;&#160;&#160;4<br/>
Captain Bezu Fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shoulders thrown back and his&#160;<br/>chin tucked hard into his chest. His dark hair was slicked back with oil, accentuating an arrow-like&#160;<br/>widow’s peak that divided his jutting brow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship. As he&#160;<br/>advanced, his dark eyes seemed to scorch the earth before him, radiating a fiery clarity that forecast&#160;<br/>his reputation for unblinking severity in all matters.&#160;<br/>Langdon fol&#160;owed the captain down the famous marble staircase into the sunken atrium beneath&#160;<br/>the glass pyramid. As they descended, they passed between two armed Judicial Police guards with&#160;<br/>semiautomatic machine guns. The message was clear: Nobody goes in or out tonight without the&#160;<br/>blessing of Captain Fache.&#160;<br/>
Descending below ground level, Langdon fought a rising trepidation.&#160;<br/>
Fache’s presence was anything but welcoming, and the Louvre itself had an almost sepulchral aura at&#160;<br/>his hour. The staircase, like the aisle of a dark movie theater, was il&#160;uminated by subtle tread-lighting&#160;<br/>embedded in each step. Langdon could hear his own footsteps reverberating off the glass overhead.&#160;<br/>As he glanced up, he could see the faint il&#160;uminated wisps of mist from the fountains fading away&#160;<br/>outside the transparent roof.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=14></a>outside the transparent roof.&#160;<br/>“Do you approve?” Fache asked, nodding upward with his broad chin.&#160;Langdon sighed, too tired to&#160;<br/>play games. “Yes, your pyramid is magnificent.”&#160;Fache grunted. “A scar on the face of Paris.”&#160;<br/>Strike one. Langdon sensed his host was a hard man to please. He wondered if Fache had any&#160;<br/>idea that this pyramid, at President Mitterrand’s explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly&#160;<br/>666 panes of glass-a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who&#160;<br/>claimed 666 was the number of Satan.&#160;Langdon decided not to bring it up.&#160;<br/>As they dropped further into the subterranean foyer, the yawning space slowly emerged from the&#160;<br/>shadows. Built fifty-seven feet beneath ground level, the Louvre’s newly constructed 70,000-square-<br/>foot lobby spread out like an endless grotto.<br/>Constructed in warm ochre marble to be compatible with the honey-colored stone of the Louvre&#160;<br/>façade above, the subterranean hall was usual&#160;y vibrant with sunlight and tourists. Tonight, however,&#160;<br/>the lobby was barren and dark, giving the entire space a cold and crypt-like atmosphere.&#160;<br/>“And the museum’s regular security staff?” Langdon asked.&#160;<br/>“En quarantine,” Fache replied, sounding as if Langdon were questioning the integrity of Fache’s&#160;<br/>replacements. “Obviously, someone gained entry tonight who should not have. All Louvre night&#160;<br/>wardens are in the Sul&#160;y Wing being questioned. My own agents have taken over museum security&#160;<br/>for the evening.”&#160;<br/>Langdon nodded, moving quickly to keep pace with Fache.&#160;<br/>“How well did you know Jacques Saunière?” the captain asked.&#160;<br/>“Actual&#160;y, not at al&#160;. We’d never met.”&#160;<br/>Fache looked surprised. “Your first meeting was to be tonight?”&#160;<br/>“Yes. We’d planned to meet at the American University reception fol&#160;owing my lecture, but he nev-<br/>er showed up.”&#160;<br/>Fache scribbled some notes in a little book. As they walked, Langdon caught a glimpse of the Lou-<br/>vre’s lesser-known pyramid—La Pyramide Inversée huge inverted skylight that hung from the ceiling&#160;<br/>like a stalactite in an adjoining section of the entresol. Fache guided Langdon up a short set of stairs&#160;<br/>to the mouth of an arched tunnel, over which a sign read: DENON. The Denon Wing was the most&#160;<br/>famous of the Louvre’s three main sections.&#160;<br/>“Who requested tonight’s meeting?” Fache asked suddenly. “You or he?”&#160;<br/>
The question seemed&#160;<br/>
odd. “Mr. Saunière did,” Langdon replied as they entered the tunnel. “His secretary contacted me a&#160;<br/>few weeks ago via email. She said the curator had heard I would be lecturing in Paris this month and&#160;<br/>wanted to discuss something with me while I was here.”&#160;<br/>“Discuss what?”&#160;<br/>“I don’t know. Art, I imagine. We share similar interests.”&#160;<br/>Fache looked skeptical. “You have no idea what your meeting was about?”&#160;&#160;Langdon did not. He’d&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=15></a>been curious at the time but had not felt comfortable demanding specifics. The venerated Jacques&#160;<br/>Saunière had a renowned penchant for privacy and granted very few meetings; Langdon was grateful&#160;<br/>simply for the opportunity to meet him.&#160;<br/>“Mr. Langdon, can you at least guess what our murder victim might have wanted to discuss with you&#160;<br/>on the night he was kil&#160;ed? It might be helpful.”&#160;<br/>The pointedness of the question made Langdon uncomfortable. “I real&#160;y can’t imagine. I didn’t ask.&#160;<br/>I felt honored to have been contacted at al&#160;. I’m a fan of Mr. Saunière’s work. I use his texts often in&#160;<br/>my classes.”&#160;<br/>Fache made note of that fact in his book.&#160;<br/>The two men were now halfway up the Denon Wing’s entry tunnel, and Langdon could see the&#160;<br/>twin ascending escalators at the far end, both motionless.&#160;<br/>
“So you shared interests with him?”&#160;<br/>
Fache asked.&#160;&#160;“Yes. In fact, I’ve spent much of the last year writing the draft for a book that deals&#160;<br/>with Mr. Saunière’s primary area of expertise. I was looking forward to picking his brain.”&#160;<br/>Fache glanced up. “Pardon?”&#160;<br/>The idiom apparently didn’t translate. “I was looking forward to learning his thoughts on the topic.”&#160;<br/>
“I see. And what is the topic?”&#160;<br/>Langdon&#160;hesitated,&#160;uncertain&#160;exactly&#160;how&#160;to&#160;put&#160;it.&#160;“Essential&#160;y,&#160;the&#160;manuscript&#160;is&#160;about&#160;the&#160;iconogra-<br/>phy of Goddess worship-the concept of female sanctity and the art and symbols associated with it.”&#160;<br/>
Fache ran a meaty hand across his hair. “And Saunière was knowledgeable about this?”&#160;<br/>“Nobody more so.”&#160;<br/>“I see.”&#160;<br/>Langdon sensed Fache did not see at al&#160;. Jacques Saunière was considered the premiere goddess&#160;<br/>iconographer on earth. Not only did Saunière have a personal passion for relics relating to fertility,&#160;<br/>goddess cults, Wicca, and the sacred feminine, but during his twenty year tenure as curator, Saunière&#160;<br/>had helped the Louvre amass the largest col&#160;ection of Goddess art on earth-labrys axes from the&#160;<br/>priestesses’ oldest Greek shrine in Delphi, gold caducei wands, hundreds of Tjet ankhs resembling&#160;<br/>small standing angels, Sistrum rattles used in ancient Egypt to dispel evil spirits, and an astonishing&#160;<br/>array of statues depicting Horus being nursed by the goddess Isis.&#160;<br/>“Perhaps Jacques Saunière knew of your manuscript?” Fache offered. “And he cal&#160;ed the meeting to&#160;<br/>offer his help on your book.”&#160;<br/>Langdon shook his head. “Actual&#160;y, nobody yet knows about my manuscript. It’s still in draft form,&#160;<br/>and I haven’t shown it to anyone except my editor.”<br/>Fache fell silent.<br/>Langdon did not add the reason he hadn’t yet shown the manuscript to anyone else. The three&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a>hundred page draft—tentatively titled Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine—proposed some very&#160;<br/>unconventional interpretations of established religious iconography and would certainly be contro-<br/>versial.&#160;<br/>Now, as Langdon approached the stationary escalators, he paused, realizing Fache was no longer&#160;<br/>beside him. Turning, Langdon saw Fache standing several yards back at a service elevator.&#160;<br/>“We’ll take the elevator,” Fache said, as the lift doors opened. “As I’m sure you’re aware, the gal&#160;ery&#160;<br/>is quite a walk.”&#160;<br/>Although Langdon knew the elevator would expedite the long, two-story climb to the Denon Wing,&#160;<br/>he remained motionless.&#160;<br/>“Is something wrong?” Fache was holding the door, looking impatient.&#160;Langdon exhaled, turning a&#160;<br/>longing glance back up the open-air escalator.&#160;&#160;Nothing’s wrong at al&#160;, he lied to himself, trudging&#160;<br/>back toward the elevator. As a boy, Langdon had fal&#160;en down an abandoned wel&#160;-shaft and almost&#160;<br/>died treading water in the narrow space for hours before being rescued. Since then, he’d suffered a&#160;<br/>haunting phobia of enclosed spaces—elevators, subways, squash courts. The elevator is a perfectly&#160;<br/>safe machine, Langdon continual&#160;y told himself, never believing it. It’s a tiny metal box hanging in an&#160;<br/>enclosed shaft! Holding his breath, he stepped into the lift, feeling the familiar tingle of adrenaline as&#160;<br/>the doors slid shut.&#160;<br/>
Two floors. Ten seconds.&#160;<br/>
“You and Mr. Saunière,” Fache said as the lift began to move, “you never spoke at al&#160;? Never corre-<br/>sponded? Never sent each other anything in the mail?”&#160;<br/>
Another&#160;odd&#160;question.&#160;Langdon&#160;shook&#160;<br/>
his head. “No. Never.”&#160;<br/>Fache cocked his head, as if making a mental note of that fact. Saying nothing, he stared dead ahead&#160;<br/>at the chrome doors.&#160;<br/>As they ascended, Langdon tried to focus on anything other than the four wal&#160;s around him. In&#160;<br/>the reflection of the shiny elevator door, Langdon’s eyes fell to the captain’s tie-clip-a silver crucifix&#160;<br/>with thirteen embedded pieces of black onyx. Langdon found it vaguely surprising. The symbol was&#160;<br/>known as a crux gemmata—a cross bearing thirteen gems-a Christian ideogram for Christ and His&#160;<br/>twelve apostles. Somehow Langdon had not expected the captain of the French Police to broadcast&#160;<br/>his religion so openly. Then again, this was France; Christianity was not a religion here so much as a&#160;<br/>birthright.&#160;<br/>“It’s a crux gemmata,” Fache said suddenly.&#160;<br/>Startled, Langdon glanced up to find Fache’s eyes on him in the reflection.&#160;<br/>
The elevator jolted to&#160;<br/>
a stop, and the doors opened.&#160;<br/>Langdon stepped quickly out into the hal&#160;way, eager for the wide-open space afforded by the famous&#160;<br/>high ceilings of the Louvre gal&#160;eries. The world into which he stepped, however, was nothing like he&#160;<br/>expected.&#160;<br/>Surprised,&#160;Langdon&#160;stopped&#160;short.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>Fache glanced over. “I gather, Mr. Langdon, you have never seen the Louvre after hours?”&#160;<br/>I guess not, Langdon thought, trying to get his bearings.&#160;<br/>Usual&#160;y impeccably il&#160;uminated, the Louvre gal&#160;eries were startlingly dark tonight. Instead of the&#160;<br/>customary flat-white light flowing down from above, a muted red glow seemed to emanate upward&#160;<br/>from the baseboards-intermittent patches of infrared spil&#160;ing out onto the tile floors.&#160;<br/>As Langdon gazed down the murky corridor, he realized he should have anticipated this scene.&#160;<br/>Virtual&#160;y all major gal&#160;eries employed infrared service-lighting at night—strategical&#160;y placed, low-lev-<br/>el, non-invasive lights that enabled staff members to navigate hal&#160;ways and yet kept the paintings in&#160;<br/>relative darkness to slow the fading effects of overexposure to light. Tonight, the museum possessed&#160;<br/>an almost oppressive quality. Long shadows encroached everywhere, and the usual&#160;y soaring vaulted&#160;<br/>ceilings appeared as a low, black void.<br/>“This way,” Fache said, turning sharply right and setting out through a series of interconnected gal&#160;er-<br/>ies.&#160;<br/>Langdon fol&#160;owed, his vision slowly adjusting to the dark. All around, large-format oils began to&#160;<br/>materialize like photos developing before him in an enormous darkroom.&#160;.their eyes fol&#160;owing as&#160;<br/>he moved through the rooms. He could taste the familiar tang of museum air—an arid, deionized&#160;<br/>essence that carried a faint hint of carbon-the product of industrial, coal-filter dehumidifiers that ran&#160;<br/>around the clock to counteract the corrosive carbon-dioxide exhaled by visitors.&#160;<br/>Mounted high on the wal&#160;s, the visible security cameras sent a clear message to visitors: We see you.&#160;<br/>Do not touch anything.&#160;<br/>“Any of them real?” Langdon asked, motioning to the cameras.&#160;<br/>Fache shook his head. “Of course not.”&#160;<br/>Langdon was not surprised. Video surveil&#160;ance in museums this size was cost prohibitive and inef-<br/>fective. With acres of gal&#160;eries to watch over, the Louvre would require several hundred technicians&#160;<br/>simply to monitor the feeds. Most large museums now used “containment security.” Forget keeping&#160;<br/>thieves out. Keep them in. Containment was activated after hours, and if an intruder removed a&#160;<br/>piece of artwork, compartmentalized exits would seal around that gal&#160;ery, and the thief would find&#160;<br/>himself behind bars even before the police arrived.&#160;<br/>The sound of voices echoed down the marble corridor up ahead. The noise seemed to be coming&#160;<br/>from a large recessed alcove that lay ahead on the right. A bright light spil&#160;ed out into the hal&#160;way.&#160;<br/>
“Office of the curator,” the captain said.&#160;<br/>As he and Fache drew nearer the alcove, Langdon peered down a short hal&#160;way, into Saunière’s&#160;<br/>luxurious study-warm wood, Old Master paintings, and an enormous antique desk on which stood a&#160;<br/>two-foot-tall model of an medieval knight in full armor. A handful of police agents bustled about the&#160;<br/>room, talking on phones and taking notes. One of them was seated at Saunière’s desk, typing into a&#160;<br/>

<a name=18></a>laptop. Apparently, the curator’s private office had become DCPJ’s makeshift command post for the&#160;<br/>evening.&#160;<br/>“Messieurs,” Fache cal&#160;ed out, and the men turned. “Ne nous dérangez pas sous aucun prétexte.&#160;<br/>Entendu?”&#160;<br/>Everyone inside the office nodded their understanding.&#160;<br/>Langdon had hung enough NE PAS DERANGER signs on hotel room doors to catch the gist of the&#160;<br/>captain’s orders. Fache and Langdon were not to be disturbed under any circumstances.&#160;<br/>Leaving the small congregation of agents behind, Fache led Langdon farther down the darkened&#160;<br/>hal&#160;way. Thirty yards ahead loomed the gateway to the Louvre’s most famous section-Le Grande&#160;<br/>Galerie-a seemingly endless corridor that housed the Louvre’s most valuable Italian masterpieces.&#160;<br/>Langdon had already discerned that this was where Saunière’s body lay; the Grand Gal&#160;ery’s famous&#160;<br/>parquet floor had been unmistakable in the Polaroid.&#160;<br/>As they approached, Langdon saw the entrance was blocked by an enormous steel grate that looked&#160;<br/>like something used by medieval castles to keep out marauding armies.&#160;<br/>“Containment security,” Fache said, as they neared the grate.&#160;<br/>Even in the darkness, the barricade looked like it could have restrained a tank.<br/>Arriving outside, Langdon peered through the bars into the dimly lit caverns of the Grand Gal&#160;ery.&#160;<br/>
“After you, Mr. Langdon,” Fache said.&#160;<br/>Langdon turned. After me, where?&#160;<br/>Fache motioned toward the floor at the base of the grate.&#160;<br/>Langdon looked down. In the darkness, he hadn’t noticed. The barricade was raised about two feet,&#160;<br/>providing&#160;an&#160;awkward&#160;clearance&#160;underneath.&#160;<br/>“This area is still off limits to Louvre security,” Fache said. “My PTS team has just finished their inves-<br/>tigation.” He motioned to the opening. “Please slide under.”&#160;&#160;Langdon stared at the narrow crawl-<br/>space at his feet and then up at the massive iron grate. He’s kidding right? &#160;The barricade looked like&#160;<br/>a guil&#160;otine waiting to crush intruders.&#160;<br/>Fache grumbled something in French and checked his watch. Then he dropped to his knees and&#160;<br/>slithered his bulky frame underneath the grate. On the other side, he stood up and looked back&#160;<br/>through the bars at Langdon.&#160;<br/>Langdon sighed. Placing his palms flat on the polished parquet, he lay on his stomach and pul&#160;ed&#160;<br/>himself forward. As he slid underneath, the nape of his Harris tweed snagged on the bottom of the&#160;<br/>grate, and he cracked the back of his head on the iron.&#160;<br/>Very suave, Robert, he thought, fumbling and then final&#160;y pul&#160;ing himself through. As he stood up,&#160;<br/>Langdon was beginning to suspect it was going to be a very long night.<br/>

Murray Hill Place—the new Opus Dei National Headquarters and conference center—is located&#160;<br/>at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York City. With a price tag of just over $47 mil&#160;ion, the133,000&#160;<br/>square-foot tower is clad in red brick and Indiana limestone. Designed by May &amp; Pinska, the building&#160;<br/>contains over one hundred bedrooms, six dining rooms, libraries, living rooms, meeting rooms, and&#160;<br/>offices. The second, eighth, and sixteenth floors contain chapels, ornamented with mil&#160;work and&#160;<br/>marble. The seventeenth floor is entirely residential. Men enter the building through the main doors&#160;<br/>on Lexington Avenue. Women enter through a side street and are “acoustical&#160;y and visual&#160;y separat-<br/>ed” from the men at all times within the building.&#160;<br/>
Earlier this evening, within the sanctuary of&#160;<br/>
his top-floor apartment, Bishop Manuel Aringarosa had packed a small travel bag and dressed in a&#160;<br/>traditional black cassock. Normal&#160;y, he would have wrapped a purple cincture around his waist, but&#160;<br/>tonight he would be traveling among the public, and he preferred not to draw attention to his high&#160;<br/>office. Only those with a keen eye would notice his 14-karat gold bishop’s ring with purple amethyst,&#160;<br/>large diamonds, and hand-tooled mitre-crozier appliqué. Throwing the travel bag over his shoulder,&#160;<br/>he said a silent prayer and left his apartment, descending to the lobby where his driver was waiting&#160;<br/>to take him to the airport.&#160;<br/>Now, sitting aboard a commercial airliner bound for Rome, Aringarosa gazed out the window at the&#160;<br/>dark Atlantic. The sun had already set, but Aringarosa knew his own star was on the rise. Tonight the&#160;<br/>battle will be won, he thought, amazed that only months ago he had felt powerless against the hands&#160;<br/>that threatened to destroy his empire.&#160;<br/>As president-general of Opus Dei, Bishop Aringarosa had spent the last decade of his life spreading&#160;<br/>the message of “God’s Work”—literal&#160;y, Opus Dei. The congregation, founded in 1928 by the Span-<br/>ish priest Josemaría Escrivá, promoted a return to conservative Catholic values and encouraged its&#160;<br/>members to make sweeping sacrifices in their own lives in order to do the Work of God.&#160;<br/>Opus Dei’s traditionalist philosophy initial&#160;y had taken root in Spain before Franco’s regime, but with&#160;<br/>the 1934 publication of Josemaría Escrivá’s spiritual book The Way—999 points of meditation for&#160;<br/>doing God’s Work in one’s own life—Escrivá’s message exploded across the world. Now, with over&#160;<br/>four mil&#160;ion copies of The Way in circulation in forty-two languages, Opus Dei was a global force. Its&#160;<br/>residence hal&#160;s, teaching centers, and even universities could be found in almost every major metrop-<br/>olis on earth. Opus Dei was the fastest-growing and most financial&#160;y secure Catholic organization in&#160;<br/>the world. Unfortunately, Aringarosa had learned, in an age of religious cynicism, cults, and televange-<br/>lists, Opus Dei’s escalating wealth and power was a magnet for suspicion.&#160;<br/>“Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult,” reporters often chal&#160;enged. “Others call you an ultracon-<br/>servative Christian secret society. Which are you?”&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a>“Opus Dei is neither,” the bishop would patiently reply. “We are a Catholic Church. We are a con-<br/>gregation of Catholics who have chosen as our priority to fol&#160;ow Catholic doctrine as rigorously as&#160;<br/>we can in our own daily lives.”<br/>“Does God’s Work necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing, and atonement for sins through&#160;<br/>self-flagel&#160;ation and the cilice?”&#160;<br/>“You are describing only a small portion of the Opus Dei population,” Aringarosa said. “There are&#160;<br/>many levels of involvement. Thousands of Opus Dei members are married, have families, and do&#160;<br/>God’s Work in their own communities. Others choose lives of asceticism within our cloistered res-<br/>idence hal&#160;s. These choices are personal, but everyone in Opus Dei shares the goal of bettering the&#160;<br/>world by doing the Work of God. Surely this is an admirable quest.”&#160;<br/>Reason seldom worked, though. The media always gravitated toward scandal, and Opus Dei, like&#160;<br/>most large organizations, had within its membership a few misguided souls who cast a shadow over&#160;<br/>the entire group.&#160;<br/>Two months ago, an Opus Dei group at a midwestern university had been caught drugging new&#160;<br/>recruits with mescaline in an effort to induce a euphoric state that neophytes would perceive as a&#160;<br/>religious experience. Another university student had used his barbed cilice belt more often than the&#160;<br/>recommended two hours a day and had given himself a near lethal infection. In Boston not long ago,&#160;<br/>a disil&#160;usioned young investment banker had signed over his entire life savings to Opus Dei before&#160;<br/>attempting&#160;suicide.&#160;<br/>Misguided sheep, Aringarosa thought, his heart going out to them.&#160;<br/>Of course the ultimate embarrassment had been the widely pub-licized trial of FBI spy Robert&#160;<br/>Hanssen, who, in addition to being a prominent member of Opus Dei, had turned out to be a sexual&#160;<br/>deviant, his trial uncovering evidence that he had rigged hidden video cameras in his own bedroom&#160;<br/>so his friends could watch him having sex with his wife. “Hardly the pastime of a devout Catholic,”&#160;<br/>the judge had noted.&#160;<br/>Sadly, all of these events had helped spawn the new watch group known as the Opus Dei Aware-<br/>ness Network (ODAN). The group’s popular website—www.odan.org—relayed frightening stories&#160;<br/>from former Opus Dei members who warned of the dangers of joining. The media was now refer-<br/>ring to Opus Dei as “God’s Mafia” and “the Cult of Christ.”&#160;<br/>We fear what we do not understand, Aringarosa thought, wondering if these critics had any idea&#160;<br/>how many lives Opus Dei had enriched. The group enjoyed the full endorsement and blessing of the&#160;<br/>Vatican. Opus Dei is a personal prelature of the Pope himself.&#160;<br/>Recently, however, Opus Dei had found itself threatened by a force infinitely more powerful than the&#160;<br/>media . . . an unexpected foe from which Aringarosa could not possibly hide. Five months ago, the&#160;<br/>kaleidoscope of power had been shaken, and Aringarosa was still reeling from the blow.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=21></a>“They know not the war they have begun,” Aringarosa whispered to himself, staring out the plane’s&#160;<br/>window at the darkness of the ocean below. For an instant, his eyes refocused, lingering on the&#160;<br/>reflection of his awkward face—dark and oblong, dominated by a flat, crooked nose that had been&#160;<br/>shattered by a fist in Spain when he was a young missionary. The physical flaw barely registered now.&#160;<br/>Aringarosa’s was a world of the soul, not of the flesh.&#160;<br/>As the jet passed over the coast of Portugal, the cell phone in Aringarosa’s cassock began vibrating in&#160;<br/>silent ring mode. Despite airline regulations prohibiting the use of cell phones during flights, Aringa-<br/>rosa knew this was a call he could not miss. Only one man possessed this number, the man who had&#160;<br/>mailed Aringarosa the phone.&#160;<br/>Excited, the bishop answered quietly. “Yes?”&#160;<br/>“Silas has located the keystone,” the cal&#160;er said. “It is in Paris. Within the Church of Saint-Sulpice.”&#160;<br/>
Bishop Aringarosa smiled. “Then we are close.”&#160;<br/>“We can obtain it immediately. But we need your influence.”&#160;<br/>“Of course. Tell me what to do.”&#160;<br/>When Aringarosa switched off the phone, his heart was pounding. He gazed once again into the&#160;<br/>void of night, feeling dwarfed by the events he had put into motion.&#160;<br/>
Five hundred miles away, the albino named Silas stood over a small basin of water and dabbed the&#160;<br/>blood from his back, watching the patterns of red spinning in the water. Purge me with hyssop and I&#160;<br/>shall be clean, he prayed, quoting Psalms. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br/>Silas was feeling an aroused anticipation that he had not felt since his previous life. It both surprised&#160;<br/>and electrified him. For the last decade, he had been fol&#160;owing The Way, cleansing himself of sins . .&#160;<br/>. rebuilding his life . . . erasing the violence in his past. Tonight, however, it had all come rushing back.&#160;<br/>The hatred he had fought so hard to bury had been summoned. He had been startled how quickly&#160;<br/>his past had resurfaced. And with it, of course, had come his skil&#160;s. Rusty but serviceable.&#160;<br/>Jesus’ message is one of peace . . . of nonviolence . . . of love. This was the message Silas had been&#160;<br/>taught from the beginning, and the message he held in his heart. And yet this was the message the&#160;<br/>enemies of Christ now threatened to destroy. Those who threaten God with force will be met with&#160;<br/>force. Immovable and steadfast.&#160;<br/>For two mil&#160;ennia, Christian soldiers had defended their faith against those who tried to displace it.&#160;<br/>Tonight, Silas had been cal&#160;ed to battle.&#160;<br/>Drying his wounds, he donned his ankle-length, hooded robe. It was plain, made of dark wool,&#160;<br/>accentuating the whiteness of his skin and hair. Tightening the rope-tie around his waist, he raised the&#160;<br/>hood over his head and al&#160;owed his red eyes to admire his reflection in the mirror. The wheels are in&#160;<br/>motion.<br/>

Having squeezed beneath the security gate, Robert Langdon now stood just inside the entrance&#160;<br/>to the Grand Gal&#160;ery. He was staring into the mouth of a long, deep canyon. On either side of the&#160;<br/>gal&#160;ery, stark wal&#160;s rose thirty feet, evaporating into the darkness above. The reddish glow of the&#160;<br/>service lighting sifted upward, casting an unnatural smolder across a staggering col&#160;ection of Da Vin-<br/>cis, Titians, and Caravaggios that hung suspended from ceiling cables. Stil&#160;-lifes, religious scenes, and&#160;<br/>landscapes joined portraits of nobility and politicians.&#160;<br/>Although&#160;the&#160;Grand&#160;Gal&#160;ery&#160;housed&#160;the&#160;Louvre’s&#160;most&#160;famous&#160;Italian&#160;art,&#160;many&#160;visitors&#160;felt&#160;the&#160;wing’s&#160;<br/>most stunning offering was actual&#160;y its famous parquet floor. Laid out in a dazzling geometric design&#160;<br/>of diagonal oak slats, the floor produced an almost ephemeral optical il&#160;usion-a three-dimensional&#160;<br/>network that gave visitors the sense they were floating through the gal&#160;ery on a surface that changed&#160;<br/>with every step.&#160;<br/>As Langdon’s gaze began to trace the inlay, his eyes stopped short on an unexpected object lying on&#160;<br/>the floor just a few yards to his left, surrounded by police tape. He spun toward Fache. “Is that.&#160;.a&#160;<br/>Carravagio on the floor?”&#160;<br/>Fache nodded without even looking.&#160;<br/>The painting, Langdon guessed, was worth upward of two mil&#160;ion dol&#160;ars, and yet it was lying on the&#160;<br/>floor like a discarded poster. “What the devil is it doing on the floor!”&#160;<br/>Fache glowered, clearly unmoved. “This is a crime scene, Mr. Langdon. We have touched nothing.&#160;<br/>That canvas was pul&#160;ed from the wall by the curator. It was how he activated the security system.”&#160;<br/>
Langdon looked back at the gate, trying to picture what had happened.<br/>“The curator was attacked in his office, fled into the Grand Gal&#160;ery and activated the security gate&#160;<br/>by pul&#160;ing that painting from the wal&#160;. The gate fell immediately, sealing off all access. This is the only&#160;<br/>door in or out of this gal&#160;ery.”<br/>Langdon felt confused. “So the curator actual&#160;y captured his attacker inside the Grand Gal&#160;ery?”&#160;<br/>
Fache shook his head. “The security gate separated Saunière from his attacker. The kil&#160;er was locked&#160;<br/>out there in the hal&#160;way and shot Saunière through this gate.” Fache pointed toward an orange tag&#160;<br/>hanging from one of the bars on the gate under which they had just passed. “The PTS team found&#160;<br/>flashback residue from a gun. He fired through the bars. Saunière died in here alone.”&#160;<br/>Langdon pictured the photograph of Saunière’s body and remembered what he’d been told. They&#160;<br/>said he did that to himself. Langdon looked out at the enormous corridor before them. “So where is&#160;<br/>his body?”&#160;<br/>Fache straightened his cruciform tie-clip and began to walk. “As you probably know, the Grand Gal-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=23></a>The exact length, if Langdon recal&#160;ed correctly, was around fifteen hundred feet, the length of three&#160;<br/>Washington Monuments laid end to end. Equal&#160;y breathtaking was the corridor’s width, which easily&#160;<br/>could have accommodated side by side passenger trains. The center of the hal&#160;way was dotted by&#160;<br/>the occasional statue or colossal porcelain urn, which served as a tasteful divider and kept the flow&#160;<br/>of traffic moving down one wall and up the other.<br/>Fache&#160;was&#160;silent&#160;now,&#160;striding&#160;briskly&#160;up&#160;the&#160;right&#160;side&#160;of&#160;the&#160;corridor&#160;with&#160;his&#160;gaze&#160;dead&#160;ahead.&#160;Lang-<br/>don felt almost disrespectful to be racing past so many masterpieces without pausing for so much as&#160;<br/>a glance.&#160;<br/>Not that I could see anything in this lighting, he thought.&#160;<br/>The muted crimson lighting unfortunately conjured memories of Langdon’s last experience in in-<br/>frared lighting in The Vatican Secret Archives. This was tonight’s second unsettling paral&#160;el with his&#160;<br/>near-death in Rome. He flashed on Vittoria again. She had been absent from his dreams for months.&#160;<br/>Langdon could not believe Rome had been only a year ago; it felt like decades. Another life. His last&#160;<br/>correspondence from Vittoria had been in December-a postcard saying she was headed to Java Sea&#160;<br/>to continue her research in entanglement physics.&#160;.something about using satel&#160;ites to track Manta&#160;<br/>Ray migrations. Langdon had never harbored delusions that a woman like Vittoria Vetra could have&#160;<br/>been happy living with him on a col&#160;ege campus, but their encounter in Rome had unlocked in him a&#160;<br/>longing he never imagined he could feel. His lifelong affinity for bachelorhood and the simple free-<br/>doms it al&#160;owed had been shaken somehow.&#160;.replaced by an unexpected emptiness that seemed to&#160;<br/>have grown over the past year.&#160;<br/>They continued walking briskly, yet Langdon still saw no corpse. “Jacques Saunière went this far?”&#160;<br/>
“Mr. Saunière suffered a bul&#160;et wound to his stomach. He died very slowly. Perhaps over fifteen or&#160;<br/>twenty minutes. He was obviously a man of great personal strength.”&#160;<br/>Langdon turned, appal&#160;ed. “Security took fifteen minutes to get here?”<br/>“Of course not. Louvre security responded immediately to the alarm and found the Grand Gal&#160;ery&#160;<br/>sealed. Through the gate, they could hear someone moving around at the far end of the corridor,&#160;<br/>but they could not see who it was. They shouted, but they got no answer. Assuming it could only be&#160;<br/>a criminal, they fol&#160;owed protocol and cal&#160;ed in the Judicial Police. We took up positions within fifteen&#160;<br/>minutes. When we arrived, we raised the barricade enough to slip underneath, and I sent a dozen&#160;<br/>armed agents inside. They swept the length of the gal&#160;ery to corner the intruder.”<br/>“And?”<br/>“They found no one inside. Except.&#160;.” He pointed farther down the hal&#160;. “Him.”<br/>Langdon lifted his gaze and fol&#160;owed Fache’s outstretched finger. At first he thought Fache was point-<br/>ing to a large marble statue in the middle of the hal&#160;way. As they continued, though, Langdon began&#160;<br/>to see past the statue. Thirty yards down the hal&#160;, a single spotlight on a portable pole-stand shone&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a>down on the floor, creating a stark island of white light in the dark crimson gal&#160;ery. In the center of&#160;<br/>the light, like an insect under a microscope, the corpse of the curator lay naked on the parquet floor.&#160;<br/>
“You saw the photograph,” Fache said, “so this should be of no surprise.”&#160;<br/>
Langdon felt a deep&#160;<br/>
chill as they approached the body. Before him was one of the strangest images he had ever seen.<br/>
