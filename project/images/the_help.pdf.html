JACKSON MISSISSIPPI:&#160;1963<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN, black, 53, stands at a kitchen sink washing dishes. &#160;<br/>She wears a yellow dress with black piping.<br/>
Two framed portraits hang on the wall above her: Jesus Christ&#160;<br/>and an UNKNOWN YOUNG BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses.<br/>
Aibileen swallows hard.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I was&#160;born in&#160;1911...Chickasaw<br/>County, Piedmont Plantation.&#160;<br/>
An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.<br/>
WOMAN (O.C.)<br/>
Did you know as a girl, growing up,&#160;<br/>that one day&#160;<i>you'd&#160;</i>be a maid?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, ma'am. I did.<br/>
WOMAN (O.C.)<br/>
And you knew that because?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
My&#160;momma was a maid. &#160;My&#160;grandmomma<br/>was a house slave.<br/>
The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.<br/>
WOMAN (O.C.)<br/>
A...house...slave.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen looks to the floor for a moment.<br/>
WOMAN (O.C.)<br/>
Do you ever dream of being something&#160;<br/>else?<br/>
Aibileen nods sadly. &#160;The room is quiet. &#160;<br/>
WOMAN (O.C.)<br/>
What does it feel like, to raise a&#160;<br/>white child when your own child's at&#160;<br/>home...being&#160;looked after by&#160;<br/>somebody else?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
It feel...<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3></a>2.<br/>
Aibileen's hands tremble as she glances sadly up to the&#160;<br/>picture of the young black male.&#160;<br/>
FADE TO BLACK:<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
I done raised seventeen kids in my&#160;<br/>life. &#160;Lookin'&#160;after white babies,&#160;<br/>that's what I do.&#160;<br/>
MAE MOBLEY (O.S.)<br/>
Ai-bee.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING<br/>
MAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, stands in a crib calling&#160;<br/>out for Aibileen.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
(sing-song)<br/>
Ai-bee.<br/>
AIBILEEN enters. &#160;Her dark black skin contrasts angelically&#160;<br/>with a light gray work dress, white panty hose and shoes.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Aibee!<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Hi!<br/>
Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
I know how to get them babies&#160;<br/>asleep, stop&#160;cryin', and go in the&#160;<br/>toilet bowl before they mommas even&#160;<br/>get&#160;outta&#160;bed in the&#160;mornin'.<br/>
Aibileen sits down with Mae Mobley in a chair placing her on&#160;<br/>her lap.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Oh, Baby Girl.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Babies like fat. &#160;They like big fat&#160;<br/>legs too. &#160;That I know.<br/>
Aibileen kisses&#160;Mae Mobley&#160;and whispers in her ear.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4></a>3.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You is kind. &#160;You is smart. &#160;You is&#160;<br/>important.<br/>
Mae Mobley leans back and repeats Aibileen's words.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
You is smart. &#160;You is kind. &#160;You is&#160;<br/>impor-tant.<br/>
Aibileen hugs Mae Mobley.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Oh, that's so good.<br/>
(laughs)<br/>
That's so good.<br/>
Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face.&#160;<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING<br/>
Aibileen lies in an old claw foot tub. &#160;Rust appears where&#160;<br/>the enamel has chipped. &#160;Several layers of linoleum are&#160;<br/>visible due to&#160;a hole in the floor caused by&#160;water damage.<br/>
Aibileen is not wearing her wig. &#160;She has salt and pepper&#160;<br/>hair bound in tight braids close to her scalp.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen leans her head back and closes her eyes.<br/>
EXT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen exits a small one story structure with peeling&#160;<br/>paint. &#160;She is in full maid's uniform and is now wearing her&#160;<br/>wig.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
I work for the&#160;Leefolts&#160;from eight&#160;<br/>to four, six days a week.<br/>
Aibileen passes two buses filled with maids going in opposite&#160;<br/>directions.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O )<br/>
I make ninety-five cent an hour. &#160;<br/>That come to a hundred eighty-two&#160;<br/>dollars ever month.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>4.<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - SAME DAY<br/>
The&#160;Leefolts'&#160;small, brick, three bedroom &#34;ranch&#34; is destined&#160;<br/>to become income property one day.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
I do all the cooking, cleaning,&#160;<br/>washing, ironing and grocery&#160;<br/>shopping, but mostly...<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - SAME DAY<br/>
Aibileen pulls a pink frilly dress on Mae Mobley. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O)<br/>
I take care a Baby Girl.<br/>
The dress has become too small to button.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O,)<br/>
And Lord, I worry she gone be fat.<br/>
Aibileen pats Mae Mobley's belly.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Ooh, Mae Mobley.<br/>
Mae Mobley pats her own belly just as Aibileen did.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Ain't&#160;gonna&#160;be no beauty queen,<br/>either.<br/>
Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 22 and lanky, enters&#160;<br/>wearing a lavender floral print dress very much under&#160;<br/>construction. Pins and double-stick tape hold it all&#160;<br/>together. &#160;<br/>
She has pointed features and a nest of teased hair. &#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour!&#160;<br/>Did you finish the chicken salad? &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. &#160;No&#160;<br/>paprika! &#160;<br/>
Aibileen nods as Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>5.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Does this dress look homemade?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I reckon when you finish, it won't. &#160;<br/>
Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good&#160;<br/>twenty degree angle. &#160;Aibileen shakes her head.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Miss&#160;Leefolt&#160;still don't pick Baby&#160;<br/>Girl up but once a day. &#160;The&#160;<br/>birthin'&#160;blues had got&#160;holt&#160;a Miss&#160;<br/>Leefolt&#160;pretty hard. I done seen it&#160;<br/>happen plenty a&#160;times...once&#160;babies&#160;<br/>start&#160;havin'&#160;they own babies.&#160;<br/>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY<br/>
A trail of dust is kicked up behind a blue&#160;Cadillac<br/>convertible as EUGENIA &#34;SKEETER&#34;&#160;PHELAN&#160;(23)&#160;drives down a&#160;<br/>rural road surrounded by&#160;farmland. &#160;<br/>
A&#160;song plays on the radio.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
And the young white ladies of&#160;<br/>Jackson...Oh, Lord, was they&#160;havin'<br/>babies. &#160;But not Miss Skeeter.<br/>
The convertible passes a small&#160;A.M.&#160;radio&#160;station.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
No man and no babies.<br/>
INT/EXT.&#160;CADILLAC&#160;/ PHILLIPS 66 GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Skeeter pulls into a gas station.<br/>
TWO BLACK STATION ATTENDANTS rush over to help her. One&#160;<br/>cleans her windshield and the other puts gas in her car.<br/>
Skeeter looks ahead to customers standing outside an adjacent&#160;<br/>movie theater.<br/>
EXT. CAPRI MOVIE THEATER - SAME TIME<br/>
&#34;Cleopatra&#34; is written across the marquis. &#160;Below, a long&#160;<br/>line of WHITE WOMEN buy tickets and go inside. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a>6.<br/>
The African-American theater patrons climb up a fire escape&#160;<br/>stairway and enter through a side entrance on the second&#160;<br/>floor. &#160;A sign reads:<br/>
COLORED&#160;ENTRANCE<br/>
INT/EXT.&#160;CADILLAC&#160;/ JACKSON JOURNAL - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter pulls into the lot of the Jackson Journal Newspaper.&#160;<br/>The Mississippi state flag flies atop the building.<br/>
INT. JACKSON JOURNAL NEWSPAPER - OFFICE - SAME DAY<br/>
A RECEPTIONIST leads Skeeter across a smoke-filled news&#160;<br/>office. &#160;Even the light bulbs have yellowed. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter wears flats, careful not to add more than a&#160;<br/>centimeter to her towering height. She carries a&#160;red&#160;leather&#160;<br/>satchel.<br/>
INT. MR. BLACKLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS<br/>
The receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD&#160;<br/>BLACKLY, 60.&#160;He has greased, grey hair and the face of an&#160;<br/>overwhelmed man. &#160;Smoke pours into the room.<br/>
RECEPTIONIST<br/>
Eugenia&#160;Phelan, Mr. Blackly.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Shut the&#160;goddamn&#160;door! &#160;<br/>
The receptionist exits. Skeeter shuts the door behind her.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
I guarantee you, one day they're&#160;<br/>gonna&#160;figure out&#160;cigarettes'll&#160;kill&#160;<br/>you.<br/>
Mr. Blackly snaps his fingers over a chair.&#160;<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Okay, Miss&#160;Phelan, let's see what&#160;<br/>you got.<br/>
Skeeter quickly hands Mr. Blackly a resumé&#160;from her satchel.&#160;&#160;<br/>He skims it over, marking it violently with a red pen.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>7.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
&#34;Murrah&#160;High Editor, Ole Miss Rebel&#160;<br/>Rouser Editor, double major.&#34;&#160;<br/>Woohoo. &#34;Junior League&#160;<br/>editor&#34;...Damn girl, don't you have&#160;<br/>any fun?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Is that important?<br/>
Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resumé back to Skeeter.&#160;<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Do you have any references?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Yes, sir. Right here.<br/>
She takes a deep breath and pulls a letter out of her&#160;<br/>satchel. &#160;She hands it to Mr. Blackly.<br/>
Mr. Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly.&#160;<br/>Flabbergasted, he drops the letter on his desk.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
This is a rejection letter.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Not exactly. &#160;Miss Stein-<br/>
MR. BLACKLY&#160;<br/>
<i>STEIN</i>?!&#160;<br/>
Skeeter points toward the letterhead.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Elaine Stein, Senior Editor at&#160;<br/>Harper and Row Publishing, in New&#160;<br/>York.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Oh, Lord.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'm going to be a serious writer,&#160;<br/>Mr. Blackly. I applied for a job but&#160;<br/>Miss Stein just thought-<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
(chuckles)<br/>
-She said &#34;no&#34;.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=9></a>8.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
(stammering)<br/>
Well, until I gain some experience! &#160;<br/>See, it says it right there, &#34;Great&#160;<br/>potential...Gain&#160;some experience and&#160;<br/>please apply again.&#34;&#160;<br/>
Mr. Blackly swivels his chair and stands, barely. &#160;Mr.&#160;<br/>Blackly is quite short.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Oh, Christ, I guess you'll do. &#160;Can&#160;<br/>you clean?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'm sorry. &#160;Clean?&#160;<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Clean!<br/>
Mr. Blackly&#160;points to a wire basket on top of a book cabinet<br/>that he can't&#160;reach.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Grab that basket.<br/>
Skeeter crosses to the cabinet,&#160;grabs&#160;the basket&#160;with ease<br/>and places it on his desk. &#160;The basket is filled with&#160;<br/>unopened letters.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Miss Myrna's gone&#160;shit-house&#160;crazy&#160;<br/>on us, drunk hair spray or&#160;<br/>somethin'. &#160;<br/>
Mr. Blackly hands Skeeter a blue notebook filled with past&#160;<br/>Miss Myrna columns.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
I want you to read her past columns. &#160;<br/>Then read these letters and you&#160;<br/>answer 'em just like she would.&#160;<br/>Nobody's&#160;gonna&#160;know the damn&#160;<br/>difference.<br/>
Skeeter forces a smile.<br/>
Mr. Blackly's phone rings.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
You know who Miss Myrna is?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I read her articles all the time.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a>9.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Articles? &#160;Ha! &#160;Miss&#160;Phelan, it's a&#160;<br/>cleaning advice column. &#160;Eight bucks&#160;<br/>a week. &#160;Copy is due Thursday.<br/>
Mr. Blackly picks up the ringing phone. &#160;<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Hello? &#160;Lou Ann, honey, I can't talk&#160;<br/>right now. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter exits the office, carrying the basket of letters as&#160;<br/>Mr. Blackly continues on&#160;the phone.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
(into phone)<br/>
I'm at work. &#160;What?<br/>
(to Skeeter)<br/>
Shut that&#160;goddamn&#160;door!<br/>
Beaming, Skeeter exits pulling the door behind her.&#160;<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME DAY<br/>
HILLY HOLBROOK, 24, white and meticulously groomed, sits on a&#160;<br/>closed toilet seat in a well-appointed bathroom.<br/>
She&#160;wears&#160;<br/>
an aggressive floral print dress covered in bows. &#160;<br/>
Her face&#160;is&#160;topped by a perfect red bouffant hairdo.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
(screaming upward)<br/>
Momma! We're late for bridge!&#160;<br/>
Hilly rolls toilet paper out from its holder. &#160;With a pencil,&#160;<br/>she places a dot on each sheet of paper, counting as she&#160;<br/>goes.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Miss Hilly was the first of the&#160;<br/>babies to have a baby. &#160;And it must&#160;<br/>a come out a her like the eleventh&#160;<br/>commandment. &#160;'Cause once Miss Hilly&#160;<br/>had a baby, every girl at the bridge&#160;<br/>table had to have one,&#160;too.&#160;<br/>
Hilly carefully rolls the paper back up in the roll.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Minny! &#160;Go get Momma!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=11></a>10.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - ENTRY FOYER STAIRWELL - SAME TIME<br/>
MINNY JACKSON, 33, black, plump and in uniform, rolls her&#160;<br/>eyes and shouts up the mahogany stairwell.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Missus Walters?! &#160;You need help&#160;<br/>coming down?<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS, 60, passes quietly behind Minny. &#160;She's&#160;<br/>wearing a&#160;heavy winter&#160;coat.&#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
I'm down. &#160;Been down.<br/>
Minny jumps with a yelp, spins around.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Gone give me a heart attack!<br/>
Missus Walters ambles towards her. The early stages of&#160;<br/>Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus Walters is still quite&#160;<br/>proud at eighty percent capacity.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Missus Walters. &#160;<br/>Here, let me help you. &#160;Let's take&#160;<br/>that coat off. &#160;It's ninety-eight&#160;<br/>degrees out there.<br/>
Minny gently helps Missus Walters out of the coat.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Oh, is it?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Well, let's put my coat on then.<br/>
Missus Walters puts her coat back on.&#160;&#160;Minny helps.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
Hilly enters the room.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Come on, Minny.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
All right. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a>11.<br/>
Minny grabs Missus Walters' pocketbook off of a foyer table.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(to Missus Walters)<br/>
Here's your pocketbook. &#160;Oh, okay. &#160;<br/>Let me get the pie. &#160;Hold on, Missus&#160;<br/>Walters. &#160;Hold on.<br/>
Minny picks up a chocolate pie which is also resting on the&#160;<br/>foyer table&#160;and follows&#160;Hilly and Missus Walters out the&#160;<br/>door.<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br/>
The Holbrook house is a two-story brick with a huge,&#160;<br/>beautiful yard shaded by ancient oak trees.<br/>
Hilly, Missus Walters and Minny walk toward a station wagon&#160;<br/>parked on the street. Hilly barks over her shoulder. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Minny, William took Billy over to&#160;<br/>Brent's Drugs for an ice cream. &#160;<br/>Hurry back and get him down for his&#160;<br/>nap. No dilly dallying.<br/>
They pass a sign stuck in Hilly's yard that reads:&#160;YARD OF&#160;<br/>THE MONTH!<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Once Missus Walters' arteries went&#160;<br/>hard, Miss Hilly moved her into her&#160;<br/>house and fired the maid&#160;<i>she&#160;</i>had to&#160;<br/>make room for Minny, too. &#160;See,&#160;<br/>Minny about the best cook in&#160;<br/>Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted&#160;<br/>her.<br/>
Hilly reaches the car and gets into the passenger seat. Minny&#160;<br/>helps Missus Walters into the back seat.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
I lost my own boy,&#160;Treelore, four&#160;<br/>years ago. After that, I just didn't&#160;<br/>want to live anymore.&#160;<br/>
Minnie hurries around to the driver's side of the car, pie in&#160;<br/>hand.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
It took God and Minny to get me&#160;<br/>through it. &#160;Minny my best friend. &#160;<br/>
(MORE)<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a>12.<br/>
AIBILEEN&#160;(CONT'D)<br/>
A old lady like me lucky to have&#160;<br/>her.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM- SAME DAY<br/>
Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken&#160;<br/>salad resting on Elizabeth’s dining table. &#160;The table has a&#160;<br/>small&#160;L-SHAPED&#160;scratch in the middle.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
After my boy died, a bitter seed was&#160;<br/>planted inside of me...&#160;<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME -&#160;LIVING&#160;ROOM<br/>
Elizabeth leans over the sofa and pushes the curtains aside,&#160;<br/>watching for guests to arrive. &#160;The hem of her skirt is still&#160;<br/>uneven, but much improved from the earlier state.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)&#160;<br/>
...And I just didn't feel so&#160;<br/>accepting anymore.<br/>
Elizabeth steps back from the window and&#160;glances anxiously to&#160;<br/>the dining&#160;table--then&#160;catches eyes with Aibileen and nods.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM -&#160;SAME TIME<br/>
Aibileen&#160;knowingly&#160;slides the platter of chicken salad over&#160;<br/>the&#160;L-shaped&#160;scratch&#160;in order&#160;to hide it.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen kneels next to Mae Mobley,&#160;who sits on a small&#160;<br/>children's training toilet.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
No!<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You drunk up two glasses of grape&#160;<br/>juice. I know you got to tee-tee.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
No.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I'll give you two cookies if you go.<br/>
Mae Mobley forms a smile as tee-tee sprinkles into the bowl.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=14></a>13.<br/>
AIBILEEN (CONT'D)<br/>
Mae Mobley, you&#160;goin'!<br/>
Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms&#160;<br/>into the bathroom.&#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Aibileen, the girls are pulling up,&#160;<br/>and the table isn't set!<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Mae Mobley go, Momma!<br/>
Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack&#160;<br/>of potatoes.&#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
(to Aibileen)<br/>
Set out the dessert forks, please.<br/>
Elizabeth storms off with Mae Mobley. &#160;Aibileen is clearly&#160;<br/>disappointed.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY<br/>
Hilly enters the front door. &#160;Minny follows behind holding&#160;<br/>the pie and Missus Walters' arm. &#160;<br/>
The BRIDGE CLUB MEMBERS chatter in&#160;the adjacent den.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
(to Minny)<br/>
Put Momma in a chair before she&#160;<br/>breaks a hip.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.<br/>
Minny lowers Missus Walters into a chair.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Hilly steps into the den with a bolt of charisma, captivating&#160;<br/>the women. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Hey, girls!<br/>
The girls squeal with excitement at Hilly's arrival.&#160;<br/>
Missus Walters calls out to Minny,&#160;who's headed to the&#160;<br/>kitchen.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=15></a>14.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Oh, Minny. &#160;Will you see if Aibileen&#160;<br/>has some of that ambrosia?<br/>
Minny nods as she enters the kitchen.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Minny enters&#160;and&#160;sets the pie on the counter&#160;as Aibileen adds&#160;<br/>sugar to a pitcher of iced tea.<br/>
Minny immediately spies a plate of deviled eggs on the&#160;<br/>counter and reaches for one.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Hold on! &#160;Those are Miss Hilly's.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
She looks like the winning horse at&#160;<br/>the Kentucky Derby. &#160;All them&#160;<br/>flowers and bows.<br/>
Aibileen laughs as she crosses behind Minny and opens the&#160;<br/>refrigerator. &#160;She pulls out another plate of deviled eggs&#160;<br/>and sets them on the counter.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
(re: the eggs)<br/>
Gots&#160;to have paprika on them.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Oh, forgive me, Lord, but I'm&#160;gonna<br/>kill that woman, Aibileen. &#160;Now she&#160;<br/>has gone to&#160;puttin'&#160;pencil marks on&#160;<br/>the toilet paper.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Did she?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Mh-hm. &#160;But&#160;I carry paper in from my&#160;<br/>own damn house. &#160;That fool don't&#160;<br/>know.&#160;<br/>
Minny grabs an egg. It disappears into her mouth&#160;with a&#160;<br/>single&#160;bite.&#160;&#160;Aibileen nods laughing and leans into Minny.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Miss&#160;Leefolt&#160;got so much hair spray,&#160;<br/>she gone blow us all up if she light&#160;<br/>a cigarette.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a>15.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(laughing, mouthful)<br/>
And you know she will!<br/>
Minny grabs a small black and white TV off the counter and&#160;<br/>picks up a TV tray.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You got some ambrosia?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You know I do.<br/>
Minny heads toward the living room.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
All right. &#160;I'll be back.<br/>
The cord from the TV drags behind her. Aibileen picks it up&#160;<br/>and wraps it around Minny's arm.<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME -&#160;LIVING ROOM&#160;- DAY<br/>
The TV set rests atop the coffee table. On TV: THE GUIDING&#160;<br/>LIGHT plays.&#160;<br/>
In an armchair, Missus Walters watches as she eats from a&#160;<br/>plate of Aibileen's ambrosia.<br/>
Skeeter enters through the front door. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Hi, Missus Walters.<br/>
Missus Walters stays glued to the TV.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
(dismissive)<br/>
I'm watching my story.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Okay.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME -&#160;DEN&#160;- SAME TIME<br/>
Hilly is commenting on her own dress to Elizabeth and JOLENE&#160;<br/>FRENCH, 24.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Isn't it gorgeous?&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>16.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Oh, it is.<br/>
Skeeter enters the&#160;den.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Sorry I'm late.<br/>
The girls turn. Elizabeth gasps; the women squeal as&#160;<br/>Elizabeth and Hilly hug her.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
You're home!<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I missed&#160;y'all,&#160;too.<br/>
Jolene hugs Skeeter.<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
Well, if it isn't Long-Haul-Skeeter. &#160;<br/>We didn't think you'd ever leave Ole&#160;<br/>Miss.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
It does takes&#160;<i>FOUR&#160;</i>years, Jolene.<br/>
Hilly spins Skeeter away from Jolene and looks her in the&#160;<br/>eyes.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I've got a great summer planned for&#160;<br/>you.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Great! &#160;I went ahead and picked up&#160;<br/>my black dress at the cleaners this&#160;<br/>morning.<br/>
Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What?<br/>
HILLY<br/>
About supper club tonight.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What?<br/>
Hilly places her hand on Skeeter's shoulder.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Honey, Stuart had to cancel.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a>17.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Again?<br/>
HILLY<br/>
He got held up on the oil rig,&#160;<br/>Skeeter. &#160;It's offshore.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I'm starting to think this&#160;<br/><i>Stuart&#160;</i>is a figment of&#160;<i>your&#160;<br/></i>imagination. &#160;So, just forget it. &#160;<br/>I'm&#160;gonna&#160;go get a plate.<br/>
Elizabeth and Hilly watch with concern as Skeeter walks to&#160;<br/>the chicken salad buffet.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DEN - DAY<br/>
Bridge has begun. &#160;Hilly, Elizabeth, Skeeter and Jolene sit&#160;<br/>at a table&#160;arranging&#160;their hands&#160;of cards.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter takes a deep breath and belts out her news.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I got a job today! &#160;At The Jackson&#160;<br/>Journal!<br/>
Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself. &#160;<br/>Finally, Hilly pats Skeeter on the leg.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
They'd be a fool not to hire you.<br/>
Jolene raises her glass as do the other girls. &#160;Large,&#160;<br/>diamond wedding rings sparkle on each of the girls'&#160;fingers.<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
To&#160;Skeeter...and&#160;her job. &#160;Last stop&#160;<br/>'til marriage.<br/>
Hilly kicks Jolene under the table.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
It's for the Miss Myrna column. &#160;<br/>Have&#160;y'all&#160;read it?<br/>
Jolene nods stupidly.<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
Hmmm.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=19></a>18.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Elizabeth, do you mind if I talk to&#160;<br/>Aibileen? &#160;Just to help me answer&#160;<br/>the letters 'til I get a knack for&#160;<br/>it.<br/>
Aibileen continues clearing dishes as if she hasn't heard a&#160;<br/>thing. Elizabeth gets very still.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
<i>My&#160;</i>Aibileen? &#160;Why can't you just get&#160;<br/>Constantine to help?<br/>
Skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Constantine&#160;quit us.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
What?!<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Oh, my gosh!<br/>
Skeeter nods her head sadly.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I'm so sorry.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Anyway,&#160;I just,&#160;um, I don't know how&#160;<br/>to answer these letters.<br/>
Elizabeth looks to Aibileen.&#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH&#160;<br/>
Well,&#160;I mean as long as it doesn't&#160;<br/>interfere with her work.&#160;I don't see&#160;<br/>why not.<br/>
A phone rings. &#160;Elizabeth nods to Aibileen.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Aibileen enters the kitchen with a stack of dishes and sets&#160;<br/>them in the sink. &#160;<br/>
She answers the phone.<br/>

EXT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE (INTERCUT) - POOL - SAME TIME<br/>
High-heeled, colorful sling-backs anchoring bare, sexy legs&#160;<br/>stand at the edge of a sparkling swimming pool.<br/>
CELIA&#160;FOOTE&#160;(O.C.)<br/>
Hello, is Elizabeth in?<br/>
We rise up to yellow shorts, a slim torso and&#160;sizeable<br/>cleavage.<br/>
AIBILEEN&#160;<br/>
She&#160;havin'&#160;bridge club right now.&#160;<br/>May I take a message?<br/>
CELIA&#160;FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country&#160;<br/>girl glory. &#160;She speaks&#160;into the phone&#160;with a thick,&#160;<br/>unrefined, Southern accent, mired in insecurity.<br/>
CELIA &#160;<br/>
Uh, yes, please tell her Celia&#160;Foote<br/>called again. &#160;I'll call back&#160;<br/>tomorrow. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN&#160;<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord.&#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
A-hem. Miss?<br/>
&#34;Miss&#34; strikes Aibileen as very odd.&#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I'm looking for some help at my&#160;<br/>house. You know any maids looking? &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
No, ma'am. &#160;&#160;<br/>
CELIA&#160;FOOTE<br/>
Okay. &#160;It's C<i>elia&#160;Foote</i>. &#160;Emerson 6-<br/>8-4. Bye, now.<br/>
As Celia hangs up, we widen to see the&#160;Foote&#160;estate. &#160;&#34;Tara&#34;&#160;<br/>pales in comparison. &#160;Celia stares at two rosebushes that&#160;<br/>have been oddly planted in the center of the lawn.<br/>
JOHNNY&#160;FOOTE, 26, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband,&#160;<br/>sneaks up behind her and grabs her on the rear.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
What's for lunch?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=21></a>20.<br/>
Celia turns with a yelp. &#160;She slaps him playfully.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
You scared the daylights out of me! &#160;<br/>
Johnny begins kissing her neck. &#160;<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Mm. &#160;It's lunchtime and I'm suddenly&#160;<br/>hungry.<br/>
Johnny squeezes Celia's behind.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
(laughing)<br/>
Johnny! &#160;Honestly!<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME -&#160;LIVING&#160;ROOM - DAY<br/>
Missus Walters sleeps in the chair in front of the TV with&#160;<br/>the plate of ambrosia in her lap.<br/>
Aibileen crosses behind her and reaches for the plate of&#160;<br/>food, startling her awake.&#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Oh! I'm still&#160;workin'&#160;on it,&#160;<br/>Aibileen.<br/>
Missus Walters resumes eating as Aibileen enters the&#160;den.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
(to Aibileen)<br/>
Who was that on the phone?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Miss Celia&#160;Foote&#160;called again.<br/>
Elizabeth&#160;stiffens then&#160;leans over and touches Hilly's arm.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
I've&#160;<i>never&#160;</i>called her back, Hilly.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
She can't take a hint, can she?<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
Who's Celia&#160;Foote?<br/>
HILLY<br/>
That tacky girl Johnny married. &#160;<br/>From Sugar Ditch!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=22></a>21.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
It could have been you, Hilly.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
And live thirty minutes outside of&#160;<br/>town? &#160;No, thank you. &#160;Anyway, I ran&#160;<br/>into her at the beauty parlor and&#160;<br/>she had the nerve to ask if she&#160;<br/>could help with the Children's&#160;<br/>Benefit Ball.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, aren't we taking non-members? &#160;<br/>The benefit's gotten so big.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Yes, but we're not telling her.<br/>
Everyone laughs but Skeeter. &#160;Aibileen begins refilling&#160;<br/>glasses of tea. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter is the only one to acknowledge this.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Thank you, Aibileen.<br/>
Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point&#160;<br/>to Elizabeth. &#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use&#160;<br/>the bathroom.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I'm fine.<br/>
Missus Walters&#160;breaks the uncomfortable silence as she&#160;shouts&#160;<br/>out from the sofa.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Oh, she's just upset cause the nigra&#160;<br/>uses the guest bath, and so do we.<br/>
Elizabeth quickly turns to Aibileen.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.<br/>
Aibileen disappears. &#160;Elizabeth leans into Hilly.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Just go use mine and Raleigh's.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=23></a>22.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
If Aibileen uses the guest bath, I'm&#160;<br/>sure she uses yours too.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
(quickly)<br/>
SHE DOES NOT!<br/>
Aibileen returns down the hall from Mae Mobley's room. &#160;She<br/>and Skeeter catch eyes.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen&#160;ducks behind a corner in the hall so she can listen&#160;<br/>to the girls' conversation.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Wouldn't you rather them take their&#160;<br/>business outside?<br/>
Skeeter tries to change the subject.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Have&#160;y'all&#160;seen the cover of&#160;<i>Life<br/></i>this week? &#160;Jackie's never looked&#160;<br/>more regal-<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Tell Raleigh every penny he spends&#160;<br/>on a colored's bathroom, he'll get&#160;<br/>back in spades when&#160;y'all&#160;sell. &#160;<br/>It's just plain dangerous. &#160;They&#160;<br/>carry different diseases than we do. &#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
(re: her cards)<br/>
Pass. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
That's why I've drafted&#160;<i>The Home&#160;<br/>Health Sanitation Initiative.&#160;</i><br/>
SKEETER<br/>
The what?<br/>
Aibileen continues listening in the hallway.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
A disease preventative bill that&#160;<br/>requires every white home to have a&#160;<br/>separate bathroom for the colored&#160;<br/>help. It's been endorsed by the&#160;<br/>White Citizen's Council.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a>23.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Maybe we ought to just build you a&#160;<br/>bathroom outside, Hilly.<br/>
The room grows eerily quiet.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You ought not to joke about the&#160;<br/>colored situation.&#160;<br/>
Hilly leans in toward Skeeter.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I'll do whatever it takes to protect&#160;<br/>our children. &#160;<i>Your lead, Elizabeth.</i><br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY&#160;<br/>
Skeeter smokes while watching through a window as the bridge&#160;<br/>club girls say goodbye.<br/>
A sermon plays over an old AM radio. &#160;Skeeter enters the&#160;<br/>kitchen, taps out her cigarette.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Aibileen?<br/>
Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Do you think you'd be willing to&#160;<br/>help me with those &#34;Miss Myrna&#34;&#160;<br/>letters?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Miss Myrna get it wrong a lot of&#160;<br/>times. &#160;Be good to get it right.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Thank you, Aibileen.<br/>
(beat)<br/>
All that talk in there today... &#160;<br/>Hilly's talk? &#160;I'm sorry you had to&#160;<br/>hear that.<br/>
The sermon continues to play over the radio.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Is that Preacher Green's sermon?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=25></a>24.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, ma'am, it is.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
That reminds me so much of my maid,&#160;<br/>Constantine.<br/>
Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I knew Constantine. &#160;We were in&#160;<br/>church circle together. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Have you seen her lately?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
No, ma'am.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Did you know that she had quit us?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Quit?<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
I got home from school a week ago,&#160;<br/>and my&#160;momma told me she had quit. &#160;<br/>Back in&#160;March...she&#160;went to live&#160;<br/>with her daughter, Rachel, up in&#160;<br/>Chicago. &#160;&#160;<br/>
Aibileen leaves the conversation and quickly begins wiping&#160;<br/>down a tray.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Did you hear that? &#160;Do you have her&#160;<br/>phone number?<br/>
Elizabeth enters, holding some papers.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Well, there you are, Skeeter.<br/>
Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers.&#160;&#160;<i>Home Health Sanitation&#160;<br/>Initiative&#160;</i>is written on the cover.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Hilly wants you to put her&#160;<br/>initiative in the league newsletter.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter nods and turns to Aibileen.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=26></a>25.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Aibileen, I'll drop by tomorrow to&#160;<br/>get started on those &#34;Miss Myrna&#34;&#160;<br/>letters.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen nods.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Y'all&#160;make it quick. &#160;Tomorrow's&#160;<br/>silver polishing day. &#160;Okay?<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter pulls in front of a large two-story farm house&#160;with a&#160;<br/>huge wrap around porch. &#160;<br/>
She&#160;exits the&#160;Cadillac&#160;carrying&#160;a black dress&#160;wrapped in dry&#160;<br/>cleaner's plastic.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter walks past an old black man working in the yard,&#160;<br/>JAMESO, 70.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Hi,&#160;Jameso.<br/>
JAMESO<br/>
How you, Miss Eugenia?<br/>
Skeeter ascends the porch stairs and enters the home.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;FARM - ENTRY FOYER - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter walks through the front door.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Momma!<br/>
The&#160;Phelan&#160;home is well appointed even though it serves as a&#160;<br/>working farm. &#160;Skeeter walks up a grand wood staircase.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - SKEETER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS<br/>
She walks into her bedroom and throws her black dress on the&#160;<br/>bed and walks back out into the hallway.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
(Shouting)<br/>
Momma?!<br/>
CHARLOTTE (O.S.)<br/>
Whoo-hoo! &#160;Back here, honey!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=27></a>26.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - PARENTS' BEDROOM &#160;- MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter enters her parents'&#160;bedroom to find her mother,&#160;<br/>CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU&#160;CANTELLE&#160;PHELAN, 50, sitting at her&#160;<br/>dressing table wearing a wig. &#160;<br/>
Charlotte turns and adjusts an auburn-colored, 'pixie' cut.&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE&#160;<br/>
(indicating the wig)<br/>
Is this a little too young?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
It's a little too everything.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Oh,&#160;hell, you're right.<br/>
Charlotte stands. Her floral print dress has a&#160;gazillion<br/>perfectly pressed pleats. She walks into her bathroom.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Charlotte enters the bathroom where several other wigs rest&#160;<br/>on wig heads.&#160;<br/>
Charlotte removes the wig and looks sadly into a mirror. &#160;<br/>Only now do we realize her decision to wear wigs isn't&#160;<br/>elective. Thinning hair detracts from her perfectly made up&#160;<br/>face.<br/>
Charlotte then takes a deep breath and grabs a different wig.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - PARENTS' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Charlotte smiles as she enters in a classic bouffant/flip in&#160;<br/>dark brown. &#160;She does a twirl so Skeeter can see all sides of&#160;<br/>the wig.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Much better.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Your daddy bought me this dress in&#160;<br/>'58.<br/>
Charlotte approaches Skeeter and tries to flatten her hair&#160;<br/>with her hands.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Momma, I want to ask you about&#160;<br/>Constantine-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=28></a>27.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
-Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar&#160;<br/>Bowl.<br/>
(re: her dress)<br/>
Come on, you try it on.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What really happened?<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Skeeter, your mother is sick, and&#160;<br/>she wants to see you in this dress. &#160;<br/>
Charlotte backs up to Skeeter.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Unzip me.<br/>
Skeeter unzips the dress. &#160;Charlotte steps out of the dress&#160;<br/>and turns to Skeeter in her slip and bra. &#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)<br/>
Come on.<br/>
Skeeter grabs the dress and turns so Charlotte can unzip her&#160;<br/>dress.<br/>
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)<br/>
Did I tell you Fanny&#160;Peatrow&#160;got&#160;<br/>engaged? &#160;After she got that teller&#160;<br/>job, her mother said she was just&#160;<br/>swimming in proposals.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, good for &#34;Fat Fanny&#160;Peatrow.&#34;<br/>
CHARLOTTE&#160;<br/>
Eugenia, your eggs are dying. Would&#160;<br/>it kill you to go on a date? Just&#160;<br/>show a little gumption.&#160;<br/>
Charlotte raises the dress&#160;up around&#160;Skeeter.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
This dress looks precious on you! &#160;<br/>If we just take it in a little here,&#160;<br/>little there. &#160;Get your hair fixed.<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
I got a job today.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Where?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=29></a>28.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Writing.<br/>
For&#160;<i>The Jackson Journa</i>l.<br/>
Charlotte angrily zips up the dress.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Great. &#160;You can write my obituary. &#160;<br/>&#34;Charlotte&#160;Phelan&#160;dead. &#160;Her&#160;<br/>daughter still single.&#34;<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
Mother, would it really be so&#160;<br/>terrible if I never met a husband?<br/>
Skeeter exits the room with the dress hanging off her&#160;<br/>shoulders. &#160;Charlotte grabs a robe and follows her out on the&#160;<br/>landing.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Skeeter! &#160;Skeeter!<br/>
Skeeter stops.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - UPSTAIRS LANDING - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Charlotte stops Skeeter and pulls her to a love seat&#160;at the&#160;<br/>top of the stairs. &#160;They sit. &#160;This is serious.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
I need&#160;to...ask&#160;you something. &#160;I &#160;<br/>read the other day about how some&#160;<br/>girls get unbalanced, start thinking&#160;<br/>these...well, un<i>natural&#160;</i>thoughts. &#160;<br/>
Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds.&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Are&#160;you...do&#160;you...find&#160;men&#160;<br/>attractive? &#160;Are you having&#160;<br/>unnatural thoughts about...<br/>
Charlotte shuts her eyes tight.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Girls&#160;or...or&#160;women?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh, my God!<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Because, this article says there's a&#160;<br/>cure, a special root tea.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=30></a>29.<br/>
Skeeter jumps up and heads toward the stairs.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Mother, I want to be with girls as&#160;<br/>much as you wanna be with&#160;Jameso.<br/>
CHARLOTTE&#160;<br/>
Eugenia!<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Unless, of course, you do!<br/>
Skeeter storms down the stairs. &#160;Charlotte shouts out over&#160;<br/>the railing to her.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Oh! Oh! Carlton's bringing Rebecca&#160;<br/>to dinner. &#160;Try to look presentable!<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT EVENING<br/>
The&#160;Phelan&#160;dining room is lit solely by candles. &#160;<br/>
The&#160;Phelan's&#160;<i>new maid</i>, PASCAGOULA, 40, is serving.<br/>
Charlotte sits at the head of the table. &#160;She's having a bowl&#160;<br/>of broth. Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT&#160;PHELAN, 60.<br/>
Skeeter's brother, CARLTON, 26, sits next to his fiancé,&#160;<br/>REBECCA, 21. &#160;They're perfectly groomed with Hollywood looks.<br/>
Pascagoula stops at Carlton's place at the table and begins&#160;<br/>serving him. Skeeter watches Pascagoula's every move,&#160;seeming&#160;<br/>to compare her to Constantine.<br/>
CARLTON<br/>
What the hell do you know about&#160;<br/>cleanin'&#160;a house, Skeeter?<br/>
Skeeter snaps to attention.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, it's a start, Carlton. &#160;<br/>
CARLTON<br/>
If you say so. &#160;I thought you wanted&#160;<br/>to write books.<br/>
ROBERT<br/>
Now&#160;y'all&#160;leave your sister alone. &#160;<br/>I'm proud of you, sweetheart.<br/>
Charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a>30.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Oh, the irony of it all.&#160;Givin'<br/>advice on&#160;keepin'&#160;up a home when she&#160;<br/>doesn't even--<br/>
Charlotte's spoon goes in her mouth. &#160;Pascagoula approaches &#160;<br/>Skeeter and sets down a plate of food. &#160;Skeeter stops her.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh! &#160;No, Pascagoula! &#160;<i>You&#160;</i>couldn't&#160;<br/>have known&#160;this...But, I'm allergic&#160;<br/>to almonds.&#160;<br/>
PASCAGOULA<br/>
Sorry, Miss Eugenia. &#160;I'll get you&#160;<br/>another one.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You know, last time I had an almond,&#160;<br/>I stopped liking men.<br/>
Charlotte glares at Skeeter. &#160;Carlton lets out a chuckle. &#160;<br/>Rebecca is mortified.<br/>
REBECCA<br/>
Oh, my Lord.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. &#160;There's&#160;<br/>a special root tea now.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
You have pushed it, young lady!<br/>
Pascagoula scurries off. &#160;Skeeter turns to her father.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Daddy, what happened to Constantine?<br/>
The room grows silent. &#160;Carlton looks down to his plate.&#160;<br/>
ROBERT<br/>
Ah...well, Constantine went to live &#160;<br/>in Chicago with her family. &#160;People&#160;<br/>move on, Skeeter. &#160;But I do wish&#160;<br/>she'd stayed down here with us.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I don't believe you. &#160;She would have&#160;<br/>written and told me.<br/>
Skeeter looks to her mother,&#160;who immediately busies herself&#160;<br/>with scooping up more broth.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a>31.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Did&#160;you...fire&#160;her?<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
We were just a job to her, honey. &#160;<br/>With them it's all about money...&#160;<br/>Now you'll understand that once&#160;<br/>you've hired help of your own. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
She raised me!<br/>
Charlotte slaps the table and stands. &#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
SHE DID NOT!&#160;<br/>
Skeeter's eyes fill with tears.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
She worked here for twenty-nine&#160;<br/>years.<br/>
Charlotte presses both hands to her stomach.<br/>
CHARLOTTE&#160;<br/>
It was a colored thing, and I've put&#160;<br/>it behind me.&#160;<br/>
Charlotte passes behind Rebecca and kisses her head.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Excuse me, Rebecca. &#160;My daughter has&#160;<br/>upset my cancerous ulcers.<br/>
As Charlotte leaves the room, Rebecca looks at Skeeter like&#160;<br/>she's the worst person on earth. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter gets up and storms off.<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - FRONT YARD - WILLOW TREE - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter storms out of the house and runs under a willow tree&#160;<br/>in the front yard. &#160;She looks across to an empty bench.<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME (FLASHBACK) - WILLOW TREE - EARLY EVENING&#160;<br/>
Skeeter, 15 and lanky, sits on the same bench under the&#160;<br/>willow tree. &#160;Despite a tight bun, her strong-willed hair has&#160;<br/>started to frizz.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=33></a>32.<br/>
Constantine approaches the willow tree. &#160;Her skin is black as&#160;<br/>night. &#160;Her eyes have a striking honey-colored hue.<br/>
She sits next to Skeeter.<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
What you&#160;doin'&#160;hidin'&#160;out here,&#160;<br/>Girl?<br/>
Skeeter turns to Constantine.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I just couldn't tell momma I didn't&#160;<br/>get asked to the dance.<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
It's all&#160;right. &#160;Some things we just&#160;<br/>got to keep to ourselves, right?<br/>
Skeeter looks down to her long, bony legs.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
All the boys say I'm ugly. &#160;Momma&#160;<br/>was third runner up in the Miss&#160;<br/>South Carolina pageant.<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
I wish you would quit feeling sorry&#160;<br/>for yourself. Now, that's ugly.<br/>Ugly is something that grows up &#160;<br/>inside you. &#160;It's mean and hurtful,&#160;<br/>like them boys. &#160;Now you're not one&#160;<br/>of them, is you?<br/>
Skeeter shakes her head. &#160;<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
Well, I didn't think so, honey.<br/>
Constantine grabs Skeeter's palm, pressing it with her thumb.<br/>
CONSTANTINE (CONT'D)<br/>
Every day.... Every day you're not&#160;<br/>dead in the ground, when you wake up&#160;<br/>in the morning, you&#160;gonna&#160;have to&#160;<br/>make some decisions. &#160;Got to ask&#160;<br/>yourself, am I gone believe all them&#160;<br/>bad things them fools say about me&#160;<br/>today? &#160;You hear me? Am I going to&#160;<br/>believe all of them bad things them&#160;<br/>fools say about me today? &#160;All&#160;<br/>right.<br/>
Constantine releases her hand.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=34></a>33.<br/>
CONSTANTINE (CONT'D)<br/>
Hm? &#160;As for your momma? &#160;She didn't&#160;<br/>pick her life. It pick her. &#160;But&#160;<br/>you... you going to do something big&#160;<br/>with yours. &#160;You wait and see.<br/>
Constantine and Skeeter stand.<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
Come on. &#160;Go home with me till the&#160;<br/>dance over. &#160;Come on.<br/>
Constantine holds Skeeter's hand and puts her arm around her&#160;<br/>as they walk down the path toward Constantine's home.<br/>
END FLASHBACK<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME -&#160;FRONT&#160;YARD - WILLOW TREE&#160;- MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter looks toward the same dirt path.&#160;An idea washes over&#160;<br/>her. She forms a big smile.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - PANTRY - DAY<br/>
Skeeter talks on the phone and fidgets with&#160;a&#160;phone cord<br/>which emerges from the casing of the closed pantry door.<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
Miss Stein, you said in your letter&#160;<br/>to write about what disturbs me,&#160;<br/>particularly if it bothers no one&#160;<br/>else. &#160;<br/>
INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING (INTERCUT) - OFFICE - MORNING<br/>
ELAINE STEIN, 45, hard but stylish, sits atop her desk, her&#160;<br/>legs crossed, talking on the phone. She gestures for her&#160;<br/>assistant to bring her a cup of coffee.<br/>
SKEETER (V.O.)<br/>
And I understand that now.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
Continue.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'd like to write something from the&#160;<br/>point of view of the help. &#160;These&#160;<br/>colored women raise white children,&#160;<br/>and then in twenty years those&#160;<br/>children become the boss. &#160;<br/>
(MORE)<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=35></a>34.<br/>
SKEETER (CONT'D)<br/>
We love them and they love us, but&#160;<br/>they can't even use the toilets in&#160;<br/>our houses. Don't you find that&#160;<br/>ironic, Miss Stein?<br/>
Miss Stein's interest starts to wane.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
I'm listening.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Margaret Mitchell glorified the&#160;<br/>mammy figure who dedicates her whole&#160;<br/>life to a white family but no&#160;<br/>one...ever&#160;asked&#160;<i>Mammy&#160;</i>how she felt&#160;<br/>about it.&#160;<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
(heard it before)<br/>
So, a side to this never before&#160;<br/>heard.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Yes! Because nobody ever talks about&#160;<br/>it down here.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - HALLWAY -DAY<br/>
Charlotte notices the phone cord leading into the pantry and&#160;<br/>knocks on the door. &#160;<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - PANTRY - SAME TIME&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE (O.C.)<br/>
Skeeter, who are you talking to in&#160;<br/>there?<br/>
Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Go! &#160;Away!<br/>
Skeeter slams the door.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
Who was that?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
My mother. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=36></a>35.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
Look, no maid in her right mind is&#160;<br/>ever&#160;gonna&#160;tell you the truth.&#160;<br/>That's a hell of a risk to take in a&#160;<br/>place like Jackson, Mississippi. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I already have a maid.<br/>
Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth.&#160;&#160;Miss&#160;<br/>Stein sits up straight.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
Really? &#160; A Negro maid has already&#160;<br/>agreed to speak with you?<br/>
Skeeter blinks hard. No turning back now. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
MISS STEIN &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>
Well...I&#160;guess I can read what you&#160;<br/>come up with. &#160;The book biz could&#160;<br/>use a little rattling.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Thank you, Miss Stein!&#160;<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, all&#160;</i>I'm saying is&#160;<br/>that I'll let you know if it's even&#160;<br/>worth pursuing. &#160;And for God's sake,&#160;<br/>you're a twenty-three year-old&#160;<br/>educated woman. Go get yourself an&#160;<br/>apartment.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter suddenly runs out of the pantry bolting past&#160;<br/>Pascagoula who is at the stove making breakfast. &#160;Within&#160;<br/>seconds she's out the front door.<br/>
SKEETER (V.O.)<br/>
&#34;Dear Miss Myrna...<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAY<br/>
Skeeter sits in a chair with a writing pad and pencil &#160;<br/>reading the 'Miss Myrna' letters to Aibileen,&#160;who is taking&#160;<br/>laundry off a clothes line.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=37></a>36.<br/>
Wind is blowing and the sky is growing dark. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
<i>&#34;Dear Miss Myrna,&#160;When I'm chopping&#160;<br/>onions, how do I keep tears out of&#160;<br/>my eyes?&#34;</i><br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Shoot, that's easy. &#160;You tell her&#160;<br/>hold a matchstick between her teeth.<br/>
Skeeter writes this down.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Is it lit?<br/>
Aibileen smiles and shakes her head.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
No, ma'am.<br/>
Commotion begins in Elizabeth's garage.<br/>
HILLY (O.S.)<br/>
Miss&#160;Leefolt&#160;said you could start&#160;<br/>right away. Build it just...<br/>
Aibileen spots Hilly walking into the carport with her son, &#160; &#160;<br/>BILLY, 4, perched on her hip.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
like&#160;the bathroom at my house. &#160;<br/>Let's see. &#160;<br/>
A CONTRACTOR,&#160;30's, follows holding a set of plans.<br/>
Aibileen tenses but continues her folding.&#160;Hilly points to a&#160;<br/>corner in the&#160;Leefolt&#160;garage.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Right there. &#160;That will be nice.&#160;<br/>
CONTRACTOR<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Thunder cracks. Trees sway wildly in the wind as a storm&#160;<br/>approaches. &#160;Rain begins to fall.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Oh, my goodness, we got to run back&#160;<br/>to the car. &#160;Come on, Billy. &#160;Bye,&#160;<br/>Skeeter!<br/>
Aibileen and Skeeter watch as Hilly runs back to her car.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=38></a>37.<br/>
Skeeter turns to Aibileen, seizing the moment.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Aibileen. There's&#160;somethin'&#160;else I&#160;<br/>want to write&#160;about...But&#160;I need&#160;<br/>your help.<br/>
Skeeter rises. &#160;More thunder cracks. &#160;Aibileen keeps her head&#160;<br/>down to the clothes she is folding.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I want to interview&#160;you...about&#160;what&#160;<br/>it is like to work as a maid.<br/>
Aibileen grabs a basket, gripping the life out of its handle.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'd like to do a book of interviews&#160;<br/>about working for white families...<br/>
Aibileen begins to perspire.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Show what it's like to work for,&#160;<br/>say...Elizabeth.<br/>
Aibileen steadies herself against a chair.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You know&#160;what'd&#160;happen if Miss&#160;<br/>Leefolt&#160;knew I was&#160;tellin'&#160;stories&#160;<br/>on her?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I was thinking we wouldn't&#160;<br/>tell her. &#160;The other maids would&#160;<br/>have to keep it a secret, too.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Other maids?<br/>
Aibileen shakes her head and walks towards the house with the&#160;<br/>laundry basket. &#160;Skeeter gathers her things and chases after&#160;<br/>her.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I was hoping to get four or&#160;<br/>five. &#160;To really show what it's like&#160;<br/>in Jackson.&#160;<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Skeeter follows Aibileen inside.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=39></a>38.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
To show what&#160;y'all&#160;get paid, and the&#160;<br/>babies, and the&#160;<i>bathrooms</i>, the good&#160;<br/>and the bad.<br/>
Bam! &#160;The front door slams shut.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME (INTERCUT) - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME<br/>
Elizabeth and her husband, RALEIGH, 25, stand toe to toe.<br/>
RALEIGH&#160;<br/>
I bought you this damn house, put up&#160;<br/>with the new clothes and the trips&#160;<br/>to New Orleans, but this takes the&#160;<br/>goddamn&#160;cake!<br/>
ELIZABETH&#160;<br/>
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general. &#160;<br/>She also said it will add value to&#160;<br/>our home!<br/>
KITCHEN:<br/>
Aibileen hears Mae Mobley crying, but she is frozen by the&#160;<br/>altercation.<br/>
RALEIGH (O.C.)<br/>
I guess Mae Mobley will just have to&#160;<br/>go to college in that damn bathroom!&#160;<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Raleigh storms in the kitchen with Elizabeth on his heels.<br/>
ELIZABETH&#160;<br/>
Hilly's covering the cost&#160;and said&#160;<br/>you can just do William's taxes to&#160;<br/>pay her back.<br/>
RALEIGH<br/>
We don't take orders from the&#160;<br/>Holbrooks!<br/>
Raleigh and Elizabeth are surprised to see Skeeter.<br/>
RALEIGH<br/>
Skeeter? &#160;How you&#160;doin'?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Fine.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=40></a>39.<br/>
Mae Mobley&#160;begins&#160;crying in her bedroom.<br/>
RALEIGH<br/>
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.<br/>
Raleigh storms out.<br/>
ELIZABETH&#160;<br/>
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's&#160;cryin'&#160;her&#160;<br/>eyes out!<br/>
Aibileen runs off. &#160;Elizabeth tries to compose herself. &#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Skeeter...I'm&#160;sorry but I think it's&#160;<br/>best if you leave now.<br/>
Skeeter gathers her things.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh! &#160;Sure, sure.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
And, this Miss Myrna thing isn't&#160;<br/>gonna&#160;work out with Aibileen. &#160;I'm&#160;<br/>sorry.<br/>
EXT. JACKSON - LATE AFTERNOON<br/>
Dark storm clouds loom over the city. &#160;A bolt of lightning&#160;<br/>strikes. &#160;The city loses power.<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LATER AFTERNOON<br/>
Rain pours over&#160;Hilly's&#160;darkened, two-story house. &#160;Specks of&#160;<br/>candle light dance in the windows.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -&#160;SAME TIME<br/>
Minny uses a newspaper to fan Missus Walters.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
You're&#160;makin'&#160;it hotter&#160;flappin'<br/>your arms like that, Minny.<br/>
Missus Walters stares out to the swimming pool. &#160;The strong&#160;<br/>winds have brought white caps to the pool's surface.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Oh, look how big the waves are,&#160;<br/>Minny. &#160;Let's go the beach. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=41></a>40.<br/>
Missus Walters rises and heads toward the dining room window. &#160;<br/>Minny follows. &#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Run and get Mister Walters. &#160;He&#160;<br/>loves&#160;ridin'&#160;these waves. &#160;You know&#160;<br/>we went to Biloxi on our honeymoon.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Yes, Ma'am.<br/>
Missus Walter's confusion grows.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
No, Ma'am,&#160;we ain't.<br/>
Minny lowers Missus Walters into a dining table chair.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Why don't you sit down here for a&#160;<br/>spell. &#160;And then me and you, we'll&#160;<br/>go down to the beach in a little&#160;<br/>while. &#160;How 'bout that?<br/>
Hilly plops down in a&#160;dining table&#160;chair and fans herself.<br/>
Missus Walters notices as Minny looks out to the garage&#160;<br/>bathroom. &#160;A patio chair is blown against its door<br/>
Minny suddenly begins squirming with discomfort. &#160;Minny&#160;<br/>hesitates. &#160;Minny turns to Hilly and&#160;gulps.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Uh...Miss&#160;Hilly?<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Mm-hm?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Never mind.<br/>
As Minny turns&#160;back to the window, Missus Walters calls out&#160;<br/>to her.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
You go on ahead and use the inside&#160;<br/>bath, Minny. &#160;It's all right.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=42></a>41.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Oh, for crying out loud. It's just a&#160;<br/>little rain. &#160;She can go get an&#160;<br/>umbrella up in William's study!<br/>
Through the window, a&#160;large pool&#160;umbrella can be seen blowing&#160;<br/>past.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
I believe she was working for me&#160;<br/>before you dragged us both here... &#160;<br/>Your daddy ruined you.<br/>
Hilly glares at her&#160;mother--then&#160;looks to Minny.<br/>
Boom! &#160;Another crash of thunder. &#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I'm just gone get your tea.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER<br/>
Minny sneaks into the master bath and shuts the door. &#160;She&#160;<br/>carefully raises the lid so as not to make any noise. &#160;<br/>
There's an immediate knock on the door. &#160;She freezes.<br/>
HILLY (O.C.)<br/>
Minny?<br/>
Minny stays completely quiet.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Hilly leans into the bathroom door.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Minny, are you in there?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Yes, ma'am...<br/>
HILLY<br/>
And just what are you doing?<br/>
Minny's eyes narrow. &#160;She flushes the unused toilet. &#160;Hilly&#160;<br/>beats on the door.<br/>
Minny slams down the toilet lid to further antagonize Hilly.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=43></a>42.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Get off of my toilet! You are fired,&#160;<br/>Minny Jackson! &#160;<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Minny exits the house into the storm. &#160;She walks angrily down&#160;<br/>the sidewalk through the wind and rain. &#160;<br/>
Hilly appears at the doorway.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Go on!<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley against an interior wall,&#160;<br/>holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Eighteen people died in Jackson that&#160;<br/>day. &#160;Ten white and eight black. &#160;<br/>God don't pay no mind to color once&#160;<br/>he decide to set a tornado loose.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Baby. &#160;It's okay. &#160;Aibee's&#160;here,&#160;<br/>honey. &#160;Aibee's&#160;here.<br/>
She kisses Mae Mobley.<br/>

DISSOLVE TO:<br/>
INT/EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - BATHROOM/GARAGE (INTERCUT) - DAY<br/>
Aibileen struggles to pull her&#160;panty-hose&#160;back up inside&#160;the&#160;<br/>crude bathroom Hilly had built in the&#160;Leefolt&#160;garage. &#160;<br/>
Her knees brush against the door. There is no air&#160;<br/>conditioning. Sweat glistens on her brow. &#160;A small window&#160;<br/>hugs the ceiling, providing little ventilation.&#160;<br/>
Elizabeth exits the house with Mae Mobley at her side.<br/>
ELIZABETH&#160;<br/>
Hurry, Aibileen! &#160;Mae Mobley's up,&#160;<br/>and I'm off to the doctor.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=44></a>43.<br/>
Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. &#160;Hearing the&#160;<br/>flush, Mae Mobley gets excited and points to the bathroom.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Aibee&#160;bafroom, Momma! &#160;Hey,&#160;Aibee.&#160;<br/>
Mae Mobley approaches the bathroom door. &#160;Elizabeth grabs&#160;<br/>her.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
No, no honey. &#160;Promise me you won't&#160;<br/>go in there.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Aibileen emerges from her bathroom as Elizabeth leans over&#160;<br/>and fixes Mae Mobley's hair. &#160;Aibileen picks up Baby Girl.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I'm right here, Baby Girl.<br/>
Elizabeth heads toward her car.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Isn't&#160;it&#160;so nice to have your own,&#160;<br/>Aibileen?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, Ma'am.<br/>
Aibileen watches as Elizabeth gets in her car. &#160;Mae Mobley&#160;<br/>lovingly glides her hand down Aibileen's cheek. &#160;Aibileen&#160;<br/>smiles and kisses her.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
You're my real mama,&#160;Aibee.<br/>
Aibileen hugs her tightly.<br/>
EXT. BUS STOP - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen waits with YULE MAY, 45, as well as other maids at a&#160;<br/>bus stop. &#160;Yule May is tall, pretty and graceful, her&#160;hair&#160;<br/>pulled tightly into a bun.<br/>
A bus pulls up. &#160;As the doors open, Minny is the first to&#160;<br/>step off. &#160;She is&#160;holding a chocolate pie. &#160;Minny is dressed&#160;<br/>beautifully in church-day attire.<br/>
She pretends not to notice Aibileen and Yule May.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=45></a>44.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Is that Minny?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Minny?<br/>
Minny turns with a guilty smile as passengers board behind.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Hey, Aibileen. &#160;<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Hi, Minny.<br/>
Minny ignores Yule May.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Uh-hm.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Where you headed?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I got some business&#160;ta&#160;tend to. &#160;So,&#160;<br/>y'all&#160;just mind your own!<br/>
With that, Minny storms off. &#160;Yule May and Aibileen look &#160;<br/>suspiciously at one another. &#160;<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
All right, then. &#160;Well, Bye!<br/>
Minnie briefly throws her hand in the air, never turning.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Bye!<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Now, she's mad at me 'cause I got&#160;<br/>that job at Miss Hilly's.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Don't worry about her. &#160;She's always&#160;<br/>mad about something.&#160;<br/>
Yule May's eyes suddenly widen as she indicates&#160;someone&#160;<br/>approaching.<br/>
Aibileen turns to find Skeeter walking toward them. &#160;She and&#160;<br/>Aibileen catch eyes. &#160;Skeeter waves.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Aibileen!&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=46></a>45.<br/>
Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, ma'am. &#160;Everything okay?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh, yeah, I just wanted to talk to&#160;<br/>you.<br/>
Yule May looks to Aibileen with concern. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You got some more &#34;Miss Myrna&#34;&#160;<br/>questions for me? &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh no. &#160;I just wanted to talk about--<br/>
The BUS DRIVER honks the horn. &#160;Yule May and others board.&#160;<br/>Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
We never finished our conversation&#160;<br/>at Elizabeth's. &#160;About the book I&#160;<br/>want to write.<br/>
Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Aibileen watches regretfully as the bus pulls away.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'd really like to interview you,&#160;<br/>Aibileen. &#160;I know it's scary.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen slowly turns.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
They set my cousin&#160;Shinelle's&#160;car on&#160;<br/>fire just cause she went&#160;<i>down&#160;</i>to the&#160;<br/>voting station.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
A book like this has never been&#160;<br/>written before.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
'Cause they's a reason. I do this&#160;<br/>with you, I might as well burn my&#160;<br/>own house down.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=47></a>46.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I promise we'll be careful.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
This already ain't careful, Miss&#160;<br/>Skeeter! &#160;You not knowing that is&#160;<br/>what scare me the most. &#160;Scare me&#160;<br/>more than &#34;Jim Crow&#34;.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter tries to hand Aibileen a piece of paper. &#160;Aibileen&#160;<br/>nervously surveys the area. &#160;A woman pushing a baby carriage&#160;<br/>walks by and looks on with suspicion.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Here's my phone number. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen quickly grabs the paper and shoves it in her pocket.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
And my car's here. &#160;I could take you&#160;<br/>home.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
No, Ma'am.<br/>
Aibileen turns and walks away. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
<i>&#34;No person shall require any white&#160;<br/>female to nurse in wards or rooms...</i><br/>
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - HALL OF GOVERNORS - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter walks out of the law library into a long hall lined&#160;<br/>with portraits of Mississippi's past governors.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
<i>...in&#160;which Negro men are placed.</i><br/>

The phone rings. &#160;<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen enters and reaches for the phone. &#160;Next to the&#160;<br/>phone, Skeeter's phone number is taped to the wall. &#160;Aibileen&#160;<br/>answers.<br/>
INT. MINNY'S HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - SAME TIME<br/>
Minny is hysterical.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it now!<br/>
Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I went to Miss Hilly's house this&#160;<br/>afternoon.<br/>
Aibileen knows this can't be good.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Why, Minny?!<br/>
MINNY<br/>
She's done told every white lady in&#160;<br/>town I'm a thief. &#160;Said I stole a&#160;<br/>candelabra.&#160;&#160;Oh, I got her back.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=49></a>48.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
What you did?!<br/>
BEGIN FLASHBACK:<br/>
EXT. BUS STOP - EARLIER THAT DAY - FLASHBACK<br/>
Minny storms away from the bus stop holding the chocolate pie&#160;<br/>leaving Aibileen and Yule May behind her in the distance.<br/>
MINNY (V.O.)<br/>
I&#160;cain't&#160;tell! &#160;I ain't&#160;tellin'<br/>nobody! I done a terrible awful&#160;<br/>thing to that woman.<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - EARLIER THAT DAY - FLASHBACK&#160;<br/>
Minny stands on Hilly's porch holding a chocolate pie. &#160;<br/>
MINNY (V.O.)<br/>
And now she knows what I done! &#160;But&#160;<br/>she got what she deserve, Aibileen. &#160;<br/>
Hilly answers the door and snarls at Minny. &#160;Minny presents&#160;<br/>the pie and says &#34;I am sorry.&#34; &#160;Hilly waves Minny inside.&#160;<br/>
END FLASHBACK:<br/>
INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
MINNY<br/>
But now I ain't gone never get no&#160;<br/>job again. &#160;Oh, Lord, Leroy gone&#160;<br/>kill me.<br/>
Minny hears something and lowers the phone.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Leroy?<br/>
LEROY (O.C.)<br/>
What you done did now, Minny?<br/>
Minny slides down against a wall as an&#160;frying pan&#160;is thrown&#160;<br/>at her.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Aibileen listens helpless on the phone.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=50></a>49.<br/>
LEROY (O.S.)<br/>
Get off that phone, woman!<br/>
MINNY (O.S.)<br/>
Leroy, please!<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Minny? &#160;Minny!<br/>
LEROY (O.S.)<br/>
Come here!<br/>
Aibileen hangs up the phone. &#160;Her breath becomes heavy as she&#160;<br/>glances at Skeeter's number&#160;taped on&#160;the wall.<br/>
EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH -&#160;MORNING<br/>
Cars fill the lot of a quaint, white, country church. &#160;<br/>PREACHER GREEN can be heard inside.<br/>
PREACHER GREEN (O.C.)<br/>
Please open your&#160;Bibles to Exodus,&#160;<br/>chapter four, verse ten. God having&#160;<br/>asked Moses to free the&#160;<br/>Israelites...<br/>
INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING<br/>
A congregation of two hundred listens&#160;intently. A large choir&#160;<br/>faces them. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen sits in the congregation.<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
Moses answered. &#34;Oh, my Lord, I am&#160;<br/>not eloquent. I am slow of speech&#160;<br/>and slow of tongue.&#34; See, courage&#160;<br/>isn't just about being brave.<br/>
CONGREGATION<br/>
Amen!<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
Courage is daring to do what is&#160;<br/>right, in spite of the weakness of&#160;<br/>our flesh. &#160;And God tells us,&#160;<br/>commands us, compels us to love. &#160;<br/>Amen.<br/>
He motions for the choir to stand.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=51></a>50.<br/>
CONGREGATION<br/>
Amen.<br/>
On Minny's children: LEROY JR.,&#160;KINDRA&#160;and SUGAR. &#160;Sugar&#160;<br/>elbows&#160;Kindra. &#160;Minny, standing in the choir, gestures at her&#160;<br/>kids, cautioning them to behave.<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
See, love, as exemplified by our&#160;<br/>Lord Jesus Christ, is to be prepared&#160;<br/>to put yourself in harm's way for&#160;<br/>your fellow man. &#160;And by your fellow&#160;<br/>man, I mean your brother, your&#160;<br/>sister, your neighbor, your friend&#160;<br/>and your enemy.<br/>
Preacher Green signals a pianist to begin playing. &#160;The choir&#160;<br/>begins swaying with the music. &#160;<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
If you can love your enemy, you&#160;<br/>already have the victory.<br/>
ON AIBILEEN<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
Let's stand. &#160;All right.<br/>
The&#160;congregants&#160;around Aibileen&#160;stand&#160;and begin to clap in&#160;<br/>time to the music. Aibileen&#160;remains seated,&#160;deep in thought.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK<br/>
There is a knock at the kitchen door. Aibileen quickly opens&#160;<br/>it and waves Skeeter inside.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Quick. Come in quick.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I parked way up on State Street and&#160;<br/>caught a cab here like you asked. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Got dropped two streets over?<br/>
Skeeter nods as Aibileen escorts her into the living room. &#160;<br/>Skeeter sits down on the sofa. &#160;Aibileen stands. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen wears the same yellow dress she wore in the first&#160;<br/>scene.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=52></a>51.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I know now that it's against the law&#160;<br/>what we're&#160;doin'.<br/>
Skeeter stares Aibileen up and down. &#160;Aibileen self-<br/>consciously flattens out her dress. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I've never seen you out of uniform&#160;<br/>before. &#160;You look really nice.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
On the coffee table sits a tray with a teapot, two cups that&#160;<br/>don't match and cookies resting on a plate.&#160;<br/>
As Aibileen pours the tea, her hand shakes. &#160;Some tea spills&#160;<br/>in the saucer and she wipes it up. &#160;Skeeter takes the cup.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I ain't never had no white person in&#160;<br/>my house before.<br/>
Aibileen gathers herself.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Miss Skeeter, what if you don't like&#160;<br/>what I got to say? &#160;About white&#160;<br/>peoples?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
This isn't about me. It doesn't&#160;<br/>matter how I feel.<br/>
Aibileen sits on the arm of an arm chair.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You gone have to change my name. &#160;<br/>Mine, Miss&#160;Leefolt's,&#160;everbody's.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Do you have other maids interested?&#160;<br/>
Aibileen is quiet for a moment. &#160;She shakes her head.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
That gone be hard.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What about Minny?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=53></a>52.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Nah, Minny got her some stories,&#160;sho<br/>nuff. &#160;But she ain't real keen on&#160;<br/>talking to white peoples right now.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
We continue with the interview&#160;that began in&#160;scene&#160;one.<br/>Skeeter sits at the kitchen table taking notes.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What does it feel like&#160;to raise a&#160;<br/>white child when your own child's at&#160;<br/>home, being looked after by somebody&#160;<br/>else?<br/>
Aibileen stands near the sink. &#160;She glances sadly up to the&#160;<br/>picture of&#160;Treelore.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
It feel...Uh.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Is that your son?<br/>
Aibileen puts some spoons in a drying rack, then sits down at&#160;<br/>the table opposite Skeeter. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, ma'am. &#160;Can we move on to the&#160;<br/>next question?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You know, Aibileen, you don't have&#160;<br/>to call me &#34;ma'am.&#34; &#160;Not here.<br/>
Aibileen nods. &#160;Skeeter stares at her list of questions.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Do you want to talk about the&#160;<br/>bathroom? &#160;Or, anything about Miss&#160;<br/>Leefolt? &#160;How she pays you, or has&#160;<br/>she ever yelled at you in front of&#160;<br/>Mae Mobley?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I thought I might write my stories&#160;<br/>down and read 'em to you. &#160;It no&#160;<br/>different than writing down my&#160;<br/>prayers. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Okay. &#160;Sure.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=54></a>53.<br/>
Aibileen stands, crosses to a small table and picks up a&#160;<br/>journal. &#160;She takes out her glasses and unfolds them.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I don't say my prayers out loud. &#160;<br/>Find I can get my point across a lot&#160;<br/>better writing them down. &#160;I write&#160;<br/>an hour, sometimes two every night.<br/>
Skeeter nods. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
And after my prayers last night, I&#160;<br/>got some stories down too.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Go ahead.<br/>
Aibileen puts on her glasses, opens her notebook and reads,&#160;<br/>nervously.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
My first white baby to ever look&#160;<br/>after was named Alton&#160;Carrington<br/>Speers. &#160;It was 1925, and I'd just&#160;<br/>turned fourteen. &#160;I dropped out of&#160;<br/>school to help&#160;Momma with the bills. &#160;<br/>Alton's momma died a lung disease.&#160;<br/>
(to Skeeter)<br/>
I loved that baby, and he loved me. &#160;<br/>That's when I learned I could make&#160;<br/>children feel proud of they self.&#160;<br/>Alton used to always be asking me&#160;<br/>how come I's black. It just ate him&#160;<br/>up. Then one time I told him it&#160;<br/>'cause I drank too much coffee.<br/>
Aibileen laughs as does Skeeter.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You should have seen his face.<br/>
Aibileen and Skeeter's laughter fades in realization of the&#160;<br/>line they have just crossed.&#160;<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY<br/>
Skeeter has just finished her first session with Aibileen. &#160;<br/>She places her notebook inside her satchel.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=55></a>54.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
This was just so great. You have no&#160;<br/>idea how much I appreciate your&#160;<br/>doing this with me. &#160;What changed&#160;<br/>your mind?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
God. &#160;And Miss Hilly Holbrook.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY<br/>
Hilly reads the paper at the breakfast table, her hair set in&#160;<br/>pin curls. &#160;Her husband WILLIAM, dressed for work, also reads&#160;<br/>the paper. &#160;<br/>
Yule May clears breakfast dishes. &#160;She starts to leave but&#160;<br/>stops herself. &#160;With something to say, she sets a plate down&#160;<br/>on the table and wrings her hands nervously. &#160;<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you&#160;<br/>and Mister William something.<br/>
Both Hilly and William put their reading down.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
My twin boys graduated high school,&#160;<br/>both on the honor&#160;roll...Well, me&#160;<br/>and my husband, we been saving for&#160;<br/>years to send them to&#160;Tougaloo. &#160;We&#160;<br/>short about seventy-five dollars on&#160;<br/>one of the tuitions.<br/>
William conspicuously checks the time on his wristwatch and&#160;<br/>quickly stands.<br/>
WILLIAM<br/>
Whoo! &#160;I am late. &#160;I gotta get&#160;<br/>goin'.<br/>
He kisses Hilly and heads out of the room, leaving Yule May&#160;<br/>alone with Hilly.<br/>
WILLIAM (O.S.)<br/>
See you tonight, honey.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Okay.<br/>
(to Yule May)<br/>
Go on.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=56></a>55.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Well,&#160;now...We're&#160;faced with having&#160;<br/>to choose. &#160;Which son can&#160;go...if&#160;we&#160;<br/>don't find all the money.<br/>
Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Would you consider&#160;givin'&#160;us a loan? &#160;<br/>I'll...I'll&#160;work everyday for free&#160;<br/>'til it was paid off.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
That's not working for free, Yule&#160;<br/>May. &#160;That's paying off a debt.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Yule May turns to leave.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
As a Christian, I'm&#160;doin'&#160;you a&#160;<br/>favor.<br/>
Yule May turns, her eyes widen with hope.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
God doesn't&#160;give charity to those&#160;<br/>who are well and able. &#160;You need to&#160;<br/>come up with this money on your own.&#160;<br/>'Kay? &#160;<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Yes, Ma'am.<br/>
Hilly raises the paper up to her face to resume reading.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You'll thank me one day.<br/>
EXT. MINNY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
Minny and Sugar exit their house and walk down the street. &#160;<br/>Both wear maid uniforms. &#160;The streets and lawns are crowded&#160;<br/>with other women, in uniform,&#160;heading&#160;toward&#160;the bus stop.<br/>
MINNY&#160;<br/>
You cooking white food, you taste it&#160;<br/>with a different spoon. &#160;They see&#160;<br/>you put the&#160;tastin'&#160;spoon back in&#160;<br/>the pot, might as well throw it all&#160;<br/>out. &#160;Spoon, too. &#160;<br/>

And you use the same cup, same fork,&#160;<br/>same plate every day. &#160;And you put&#160;<br/>it up in the cabinet. &#160;You tell that&#160;<br/>white woman that's where you gone&#160;<br/>keep it from now on out. Don't do it&#160;<br/>and see what happens.<br/>
(to women going to work)<br/>
Mornin', ladies.<br/>
EXT. MINNY'S NEIGHBORHOOD&#160;-&#160;BUS STOP - DAY<br/>
Minny and Sugar approach two waiting buses.<br/>
MINNY&#160;<br/>
And when you're&#160;servin'&#160;white folks&#160;<br/>coffee, you set it down in front of&#160;<br/>'em. &#160;Don't hand it to them, because&#160;<br/>your hands can't touch. &#160;And don't&#160;<br/>hit on their children. &#160;White folks&#160;<br/>like to do they own spanking.<br/>
Minny stops Sugar.&#160;<br/>
MINNY&#160;<br/>
And, last thing. &#160;Come here. &#160;<br/>
Sugar turns her head away. &#160;Minny grabs her face and forces&#160;<br/>her to look at her.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Look at me. &#160;No&#160;sass-mouthin'! &#160; No&#160;<br/>sass-mouthin'. &#160;I mean it.<br/>
Minnie smooths Sugar's clothes.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Give your momma a kiss.<br/>
Minny kisses Sugar on the cheek and watches as she boards the&#160;<br/>first bus with other domestics.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Leroy made Sugar quit school to help&#160;<br/>him with the bills. &#160;And every day&#160;<br/>Minny went without a job might have&#160;<br/>been a day Leroy took her from our&#160;<br/>world.<br/>
Minny wipes a tear from her eye and boards the second bus.<br/>

EXT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - LATER<br/>
Minny approaches the&#160;Foote&#160;estate, examines it&#160;<br/>apprehensively. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
But I knew... I knew the only white&#160;<br/>lady Miss Hilly hadn't gotten to&#160;<br/>with her lies.<br/>
EXT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
In the distance, Celia&#160;Foote&#160;emerges barefoot from the front&#160;<br/>door. &#160;She waves excitedly at Minny.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Hi! &#160;Hey! &#160;Come on!<br/>
Minny waves back as she resumes walking toward the house.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(under her breath)<br/>
No&#160;sass-mouthin', Minny Jackson, no&#160;<br/>sass&#160;mouthin'...&#160;<br/>

Celia&#160;Foote&#160;brings Minny inside. &#160;Celia is covered in tight&#160;<br/>pink clothes. &#160;<br/>
Celia sits down on a chair and begins to put on her shoes.&#160;<br/>There's a smudge of flour on her cheek.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Aibileen said you'd be on time. &#160;I'm&#160;<br/>Celia Rae&#160;Foote.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I'm Minny Jackson.&#160;<br/>
(indicating flour)<br/>
You&#160;cookin'&#160;somethin'?<br/>
Celia wipes flour from her cheek.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
One of those upside-down cakes from&#160;<br/>the magazine. &#160;It ain't&#160;workin'&#160;out&#160;<br/>too good.&#160;<br/>
Celia jumps up and grabs Minny's arm.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=59></a>58.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Come on. &#160;Let's get you a cold Coca-<br/>Cola.<br/>
Minny follows her to the kitchen.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Minny enters behind Celia gawking at an upside&#160;down cake&#160;<br/>massacre. &#160;Flour eggs and batter cover a kitchen table and&#160;<br/>spill onto the floor.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
This here's the kitchen!<br/>
MINNY<br/>
What in the hell-<br/>
Celia returns from the fridge with two Coca-Cola bottles.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
(embarrassed)<br/>
I guess I got some&#160;learnin'&#160;to do.<br/>
MINNY&#160;<br/>
You sure do.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - DINING ROOM -&#160;MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Minny and Celia enter a huge dining room. &#160;Minny gawks at a&#160;<br/>dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs.&#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Johnny's&#160;grandmomma&#160;left him this&#160;<br/>house when she died and then&#160;<br/>Johnny's momma wouldn't let me&#160;<br/>change a thing. &#160;But if I had my&#160;<br/>way, this place would have wall to&#160;<br/>wall white carpet with gold trim. &#160;<br/>None of this old stuff.&#160;<br/>
EXT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - LIBRARY -&#160;DAY<br/>
Celia&#160;and Minny&#160;exit&#160;a detached library&#160;and head back toward&#160;<br/>the main house.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
We got five bedrooms and bathrooms&#160;<br/>back in the main house. &#160;Then the&#160;<br/>pool house has two more beds and&#160;<br/>baths.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=60></a>59.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
When&#160;y'all&#160;gone have some&#160;chillin',&#160;<br/>start fillin' up all those beds?<br/>
Celia swallows hard&#160;and turns to Minny.<br/>
She places her hand&#160;<br/>
on her stomach.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I'm pregnant now. &#160;<br/>
Minny steps back and surveys Celia.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Gone be&#160;eatin'&#160;for two. &#160;Double the&#160;<br/>cookin'.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I know it's an awful lot to do. &#160;<br/>Five other maids have already turned&#160;<br/>me&#160;down...Let&#160;me at least get you&#160;<br/>some bus money.<br/>
Minny stops and puts her hand on her hip.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Now, uh, when you hear me say I&#160;<br/>don't wanna clean this house?<br/>
CELIA<br/>
What? &#160;So...You'll&#160;do it?!<br/>
Celia jumps up and down with joy, splashing Coke out of the&#160;<br/>bottle she holds. &#160;She hugs Minny.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Oh. No&#160;huggin', now. &#160;No&#160;huggin'.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Oh. &#160;Sorry. &#160;This is the first time&#160;<br/>I've hired a maid.<br/>
Celia laughs, puts a hand on Minny's back and pushes her&#160;<br/>toward the house.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Come on.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Celia and Minny enter the living room. &#160;Celia crosses the&#160;<br/>room&#160;toward the kitchen.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=61></a>60.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
You hungry?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
No, ma'am. &#160;Now hold on a minute. &#160;<br/>We&#160;gots&#160;to talk about some things&#160;<br/>first.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Oh.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I work Sunday through Friday. &#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
No, you can't work at all on&#160;<br/>weekends.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Okay. &#160;Well, what time you want me&#160;<br/>here?<br/>
CELIA<br/>
After nine, and you gotta leave&#160;<br/>before four.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Okay. Now what your husband say you&#160;<br/>can pay?<br/>
Celia looks away.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Johnny doesn't know I'm bringing in&#160;<br/>help.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
And what's Mr. Johnny gone do when&#160;<br/>he come home and finds a colored&#160;<br/>woman in his house?<br/>
CELIA<br/>
It's not like I'd be fibbing. I just&#160;<br/>want him to think I can do this on&#160;<br/>my own... I really need a maid.<br/>
Minny lets out a big breath.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I'll be here tomorrow&#160;mornin'&#160;'bout&#160;<br/>nine-fifteen.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Great.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=62></a>61.<br/>
Minny begins sniffing the air.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Miss Celia, I think you done burnt&#160;<br/>up yo' cake.<br/>
Celia rises from her chair and sniffs the air.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Doggone it!<br/>
Celia&#160;runs to&#160;the kitchen.<br/>
EXT. JUNIOR LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING<br/>
Two&#160;black&#160;men&#160;cut the&#160;lawn&#160;of the Junior League headquarters.<br/>
HILLY (O.C.)<br/>
Okay, let's see. &#160;What's first up on&#160;<br/>the agenda?&#160;<br/>
INT. JUNIOR LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING<br/>
Hilly stands at a podium as the members of the Junior League&#160;<br/>take their seats. &#160;Half the girls are pregnant. &#160;Most of them&#160;<br/>drink TAB and smoke cigarettes.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
We're running behind on our &#34;coat&#160;<br/>drive,&#34; girls. Hurry up and clean&#160;<br/>out those closets.&#160;Our Christmas&#160;<br/>Benefit, however, is right on&#160;<br/>schedule.<br/>
Hilly scans the crowd.<br/>
HILLY (CONT'D)<br/>
Mary Beth?<br/>
Hilly finds Mary Beth Caldwell and nods for her to stand.&#160;<br/>Mary Beth stands.<br/>
MARY BETH<br/>
Well, thanks to&#160;y'all, I can&#160;<br/>announce that we've already filled&#160;<br/>every raffle slot for baked goods.<br/>
The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=63></a>62.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
(to&#160;the room)<br/>
Think we can put a&#160;dent&#160;in African&#160;<br/>Children's hunger this year?! &#160;<br/>
MARY BETH<br/>
A big dent!<br/>
More applause. &#160;Hilly signals for Mary Beth to sit down. &#160;She&#160;<br/>does. &#160;&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Now, I just found out the Surgeon&#160;<br/>General has reviewed&#160;<i>The Home Health&#160;<br/>Sanitation Initiative&#160;</i>that I&#160;<br/>drafted.<br/>
Some&#160;members nod in approval.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
And he just passed it along to&#160;<br/>Governor Barnett!<br/>
Even more applause.<br/>
ON SKEETER, who remains stone-faced.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Skeeter, when can we expect to see&#160;<br/>the initiative in the newsletter? &#160;I&#160;<br/>gave it to you a month ago.<br/>
Everyone turns to Skeeter. &#160;Elizabeth&#160;turns to Skeeter in a&#160;<br/>panic.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
I gave that to you myself!<br/>
Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Would you please stand, Skeeter? &#160;<br/>
As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'll have it in there real soon.<br/>
Hilly raises a disdainful eyebrow as Skeeter&#160;sits&#160;back into&#160;<br/>her seat.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Great!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=64></a>63.<br/>
INT. BRENT'S PHARMACY AND SODA FOUNTAIN - LATER THAT DAY<br/>
Skeeter races into Brent's busy soda fountain area. &#160;She&#160;<br/>passes a separate counter where several BLACK DOMESTICS, in&#160;<br/>uniform, are picking up to-go orders.&#160;<br/>
Hilly and Elizabeth await Skeeter's arrival in a booth. &#160;<br/>Skeeter sits next to Elizabeth&#160;and&#160;across from Hilly.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Sorry I'm late.<br/>
Hilly shakes her head with little emotion. &#160;Elizabeth slides&#160;<br/>a coke float in front of Skeeter.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Thanks. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter slowly looks to Hilly.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Hilly, I really am sorry about the&#160;<br/>newsletter. &#160;It's just with Momma&#160;<br/>being sick and all.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Oh, it's fine.<br/>
A waiter, HENRY, black, early&#160;30s, approaches the table.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
I made you an egg and olive on rye,&#160;<br/>Miss Skeeter.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter smiles.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh, thank you, Henry. &#160;You&#160;<br/>remembered.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
You're welcome.<br/>
Henry walks away. &#160;Hilly and Elizabeth smile at Skeeter&#160;<br/>devilishly.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Oh, Hilly, tell her! &#160;I can hardly&#160;<br/>stand it!<br/>
Hilly erupts with excitement.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=65></a>64.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
He's coming! &#160;Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's&#160;<br/>definitely coming this time. &#160;Next&#160;<br/>Saturday week. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, he's cancelled twice before. &#160;<br/>So&#160;don't you think maybe that's a&#160;<br/>sign? &#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Don't you dare say that!<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You know I'm not&#160;gonna&#160;be his type.<br/>
Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Damnit, Skeeter, I'm not going to&#160;<br/>let you miss out on this just&#160;<br/>because your mother convinced you&#160;<br/>you're not good enough for somebody&#160;<br/>like him.<br/>
Elizabeth pokes Skeeter in her side.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Saturday night!<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DAY<br/>
A&#160;YARD MAN, black,&#160;mows the&#160;Holbrook&#160;lawn.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY<br/>
Yule May vacuums&#160;the Holbrook living room. &#160;She pulls the&#160;<br/>sofa away from the wall to clean beneath it.<br/>
Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over. &#160;She&#160;<br/>slowly rises,&#160;holding a SMALL RUBY RING. &#160;Years of dust and&#160;<br/>hair blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold.<br/>
Yule May breathes heavily. &#160;She shoves the ring into her&#160;<br/>uniform pocket.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - NEXT MORNING<br/>
Aibileen puts Mae Mobley down on a changing table.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=66></a>65.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Good morning. &#160;Good morning, Baby&#160;<br/>Girl.<br/>
As Aibileen removes the diaper she grows sorrowful at the&#160;<br/>sight of Mae Mobley's&#160;bottom, inflamed with&#160;diaper rash.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Skeeter writes in her note pad. &#160;Aibileen is more casually&#160;<br/>dressed than before.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I reckon I'm ready to talk about&#160;<br/>Miss&#160;Leefolt&#160;now.<br/>
Skeeter nods.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Baby girl still gotta wear a diaper&#160;<br/>when she sleep at night. &#160;And, it&#160;<br/>don't get changed 'til I get there&#160;<br/>in the morning. &#160;That's 'bout ten&#160;<br/>hours she gotta sleep in her mess.&#160;<br/>Now Missus&#160;Leefolt&#160;pregnant with her&#160;<br/>second baby. &#160;And, Lord, I pray this&#160;<br/>child turn out good. It a lonely&#160;<br/>road if a momma don't think they&#160;<br/>child is pretty.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
That's very true.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Miss&#160;Leefolt&#160;should not be having&#160;<br/>babies. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter lifts her head from her pad in response to Aibileen's&#160;<br/>bold statement.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Write that down.<br/>
Skeeter nods and writes down&#160;what&#160;Aibileen&#160;has said. The&#160;<br/>faint sound of sirens is heard in the distance. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Treelore&#160;would like me doing this. &#160;<br/>He always said we&#160;gonna&#160;have a&#160;<br/>writer in the family one day. &#160;<br/>Always thought it was&#160;gonna&#160;be him. &#160;<br/>Maybe it gonna be me.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=67></a>66.<br/>
Just then, Minny is heard approaching Aibileen's house<br/>outside.<br/>
MINNY (0.C.)<br/>
Aibileen! Aibileen! &#160;<br/>
Minny barges through the kitchen door.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
They done set off a bomb in&#160;Medgar<br/>Evers'&#160;carport. &#160;<br/>
Minny stops cold in her tracks at the sight of Skeeter. &#160;Her &#160;<br/>face hardens. &#160;She turns to Aibileen.<br/>
MINNY (V.O.)<br/>
Yule May told me what&#160;y'all&#160;was up&#160;<br/>to. &#160;I didn't wanna believe it.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen looks to the floor. &#160;Minny scowls at Skeeter.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
And just what makes you think&#160;<br/>colored people need your help? &#160;Why&#160;<br/>do you care?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Minny.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(to Skeeter)<br/>
Maybe you just want to get Aibileen&#160;<br/>in trouble. &#160;<br/>
More sirens are heard coming from other directions. &#160;Skeeter&#160;<br/>is petrified. &#160;Her face reddens.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
No. I want to show her&#160;<br/>perspective...so&#160;people might&#160;<br/>understand what it's like from your&#160;<br/>side.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Well it's a real Fourth of July&#160;<br/>picnic. It's what we dream a doing&#160;<br/>all weekend long, get back in they&#160;<br/>house to polish the silver. &#160;And we&#160;<br/>just love not&#160;makin'&#160;minimum wage or&#160;<br/>gettin'&#160;Social Security.&#160;<br/>
Minny makes a point to make eye contact with Aibileen.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=68></a>67.<br/>
MINNY&#160;<br/>
And how we love they children when&#160;<br/>they little and then they turn out&#160;<br/>just like they&#160;mommas.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I know. So maybe things can change.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
What law's&#160;gonna&#160;say you gotta be&#160;<br/>nice to your maid?&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You don't have to do this, Minny.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You damn right I don't! &#160;You two &#160;<br/>givin'&#160;me the heart palpitations.<br/>
Minny storms out the back door. &#160;Aibileen turns to Skeeter.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
And that's a good mood.<br/>
EXT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Minny gestures and mumbles to herself. &#160;She stops suddenly,<br/>spins around,&#160;and heads back in the house.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Minny storms back in the kitchen. &#160;She stands above Aibileen.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
All&#160;right...I'm&#160;gone do it. &#160;I just&#160;<br/>want to make sure she understand&#160;<br/>this ain't no game we&#160;playin'&#160;here.<br/>
Skeeter nods,&#160;trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle&#160;<br/>of the kitchen and sits.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Slide your chair out from under that&#160;<br/>table and face me. &#160;I need to see&#160;<br/>you square on at all times.&#160;<br/>
Still trembling, Skeeter slides her chair from the table.&#160;She&#160;<br/>sits&#160;speechless,&#160;staring at Minny.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I got to come up with your&#160;<br/>questions, too?!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=69></a>68.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh! &#160;Uh, let's begin with, uh, with&#160;<br/>where you were born.<br/>
Minnie picks up a piece of fried chicken and takes a bite.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Belzoni, Mississippi on my great-<br/>auntie's sofa. &#160;Next!<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - HOURS LATER<br/>
Skeeter and Minny now stand together at the stove as Minny&#160;<br/>gives a cooking lesson. &#160;Aibileen takes notes.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I put the green beans in first, then&#160;<br/>I get on the pork chops so I can get&#160;<br/>started on the corn bread.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Once Minny got to talking 'bout&#160;<br/>food, she liked to never stop. And&#160;<br/>when she got to talking about the&#160;<br/>white ladies, it took all night.&#160;<br/>
EXT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - MORNING<br/>
The first signs of morning sunshine on Aibileen's house. &#160;<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SUNRISE<br/>
Aibileen stands over her stove,&#160;frying bacon and eggs. &#160;<br/>Skeeter and Minny are now seated at the table, wearing the&#160;<br/>same clothes as the night before. &#160;Minny is still going&#160;<br/>strong. &#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
&#34;Oh, Minny, I'm gone give you a paid&#160;<br/>vacation.&#34; &#160;Now, I ain't had no paid&#160;<br/>vacation in my life. &#160;A week later,&#160;<br/>I come back and they done moved to&#160;<br/>Mobile. &#160;&#34;Miss Lazy Fingers&#34; scared&#160;<br/>I'd find a new job&#160;<i>before&#160;</i>she moved.<br/>
Minny and Aibileen laugh. &#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Ain't that right, Aibileen?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=70></a>69.<br/>
Aibileen nods and laughs harder. &#160;Minny has a sudden&#160;<br/>realization.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
We&#160;gots&#160;to get more maids!<br/>
Minny stands. &#160;Skeeter's eyes widen with hope.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
It hard. &#160;You go try and see.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Okay, I will.<br/>
Mind racing, Minny flies out the door without a word. &#160;<br/>Aibileen turns to Skeeter.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
We gone and done it now.<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - BACK STAIRS - LATER THAT MORNING<br/>
Charlotte pokes her head out of the kitchen's screened door.&#160;<br/>She shouts up the exterior porch stairs.<br/>
CHARLOTTE&#160;<br/>
Skeeter. &#160;Get down here. &#160;Something&#160;<br/>just arrived from New York for you!<br/>
Skeeter quickly emerges at the top of the stairs and runs&#160;<br/>down the stairs into the kitchen.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Skeeter finds her mother standing above a big opened box&#160;<br/>resting on the kitchen table.<br/>
Charlotte, now in an auburn wig, takes a drag from a&#160;<br/>cigarette, then lifts up a silver machine complete with power&#160;<br/>cord and rubber hose.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What is that?!<br/>
CHARLOTTE&#160;<br/>
The&#160;Shinolator! &#160;All the way from&#160;<br/>New York City. &#160;I'm a good mother. &#160;<br/>Come on. &#160;Sit down.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=71></a>70.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter sits with a towel draped across her shoulders as&#160;<br/>Charlotte puts large curlers and the&#160;Shinolator&#160;solution in&#160;<br/>Skeeter's hair.&#160;<br/>
Pascagoula cooks behind them.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
The whole system cost&#160;eleven<br/>dollars! &#160;It even smells expensive. &#160;<br/>You're going to look beautiful on&#160;<br/>your date tonight.<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
I can feel the hope in your fingers.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - LATER&#160;<br/>
The&#160;Shinolator&#160;was a success. &#160;Skeeter's hair is straight,&#160;<br/>silky and beautiful. &#160;Skeeter gazes into the mirror.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Holy&#160;shit. &#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
You've shrunk five inches. &#160;You'll&#160;<br/>be able to wear heels tonight.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh my God.<br/>
Charlotte looks down to the huarache shoes on Skeeter's feet&#160;<br/>and begins forcibly removing them.&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
You're not leaving this house in&#160;<br/>those awful, Mexican man-shoes.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Can I take the&#160;Cadillac?<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
We promised the&#160;Cadillac&#160;to Carlton&#160;<br/>and Rebecca tonight. &#160;So William's&#160;<br/>cousin will just have to come pick&#160;<br/>you up himself. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'll take the truck.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
It's hooked to the motor grader.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=72></a>71.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'll drive slow.<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - FIELD - LATER THAT AFTERNOON<br/>
Skeeter pulls away in a rusted 1941 Chevy farm truck with a&#160;<br/>huge road grader attached. &#160;Charlotte runs next to the truck.&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Skeeter! &#160;Skeeter! &#160;Now remember, no&#160;<br/>gentleman wants to spend the evening&#160;<br/>with a sourpuss. &#160;Don't mope! &#160;<br/>Smile!<br/>
Skeeter floors it. &#160;Charlotte runs faster.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
And for heaven's sake, don't sit&#160;<br/>like some squaw Indian. &#160;Cross your&#160;<br/>ankles!<br/>
Skeeter pulls away from her mother.&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
I love you!<br/>
Skeeter's truck disappears within a cloud of dust<br/>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter speeds across a bridge pulling the grader behind her. &#160;<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT - DUSK<br/>
Hilly, her husband William, and Skeeter's date, STUART&#160;<br/>WHITWORTH, 25, drink highballs as Yule May hovers. &#160;<br/>
Hilly checks her watch.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.<br/>
The front door flies open. &#160;Skeeter enters completely out of&#160;<br/>breath and sweaty. &#160;Her HAIR HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Hey.<br/>
Hilly gasps and rushes to her.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=73></a>72.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Skeeter!<br/>
William and Stuart stand. &#160;Hilly escorts Skeeter past the&#160;<br/>men.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Boys, we'll be right back. &#160;Y'all<br/>talk about quarterbacks or&#160;<br/>something. &#160;Yule May, get Miss&#160;<br/>Skeeter a Coca-Cola.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Yule May runs off. &#160;Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall. &#160;<br/>William and Stuart drain their drinks.<br/>
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - NIGHT<br/>
Hilly, William, Stuart and Skeeter sit at a round table&#160;<br/>adorned with white linens, silver and fine china.&#160;<br/>
The room buzzes with Jackson's elite,&#160;all trying to be&#160;<br/>noticed.&#160;A&#160;Frankie&#160;Avalon tune plays in the background.<br/>
Stuart finishes the drink he's holding&#160;and&#160;motions to a&#160;<br/>waiter for another.<br/>
STUART<br/>
(to Skeeter)<br/>
You want a drink?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Just water, please.<br/>
Stuart grows annoyed with Skeeter's answer.<br/>
STUART<br/>
(to waiter)<br/>
Double Old Kentucky&#160;straight...with<br/>a&#160;water&#160;back...Make&#160;that&#160;<i>two&#160;</i>backs.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You sure you don't want to just make&#160;<br/>it the whole bottle and a straw?<br/>
Hilly spots someone at the front of the restaurant. &#160;She&#160;<br/>jumps up and grabs William's arm.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Honey, there's the Lieutenant&#160;<br/>Governor. &#160; Let's go say &#34;hi&#34;.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=74></a>73.<br/>
Hilly pulls William away and they approach the Lieutenant&#160;<br/>Governor and his party.&#160;<br/>
Stuart finally turns to Skeeter.<br/>
STUART<br/>
(flatly)<br/>
So...&#160;What do you do with your time? &#160;<br/>Do you work?<br/>
The waiter returns with Stuart's drink and the water backs.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I write... But right now I am&#160;<br/>writing a domestic maintenance&#160;<br/>column for the Jackson Journal.<br/>
Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.<br/>
STUART<br/>
You mean&#160;housekeepin'?<br/>
Skeeter nods and grabs her water.&#160;<br/>
STUART<br/>
Jesus, I can't think of anything&#160;<br/>worse than reading a&#160;cleanin'<br/>column. &#160;Except for maybe&#160;writin'<br/>one.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well,&#160;I can. &#160;Working with a bunch&#160;<br/>of greasy, stinky men in the middle&#160;<br/>of the ocean.<br/>
Stuart laughs, somewhat impressed. &#160;He leans in to Skeeter.<br/>
STUART<br/>
It sounds to me like a ploy to find&#160;<br/>a husband? &#160;You becoming an expert&#160;<br/>on keeping house?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, you must be a genius. You&#160;<br/>figured out my whole scheme.<br/>
Skeeter fumes.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Isn't that what all you girls from&#160;<br/>Ole Miss major in? &#160;Professional&#160;<br/>husband hunting?<br/>
Hilly and William return to the table and sit.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=75></a>74.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Who is hungry?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
(To Stuart)<br/>
I'm sorry, but were you dropped on&#160;<br/>your head as an infant? &#160;Or were you&#160;<br/>just born stupid?<br/>
Hilly's smile disappears. &#160;Skeeter drops her napkin on the&#160;<br/>table, stands, and stalks out of the restaurant. &#160;<br/>
Stuart laughs and points at William,&#160;trying to lure him in on&#160;<br/>the fun. &#160;William&#160;shakes his head sheepishly and turns away&#160;<br/>before Hilly can see.<br/>
EXT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - BACKYARD - CHICKEN COOP&#160;- DAY<br/>
Minny watches from the window as Celia carries a chicken&#160;<br/>upside down by its feet towards an axe resting on a stump.<br/>
Minny grimaces as Celia positions the bird and grabs the axe.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - KITCHEN&#160;- LATER THAT DAY<br/>
Celia and Minny stand at a fried chicken assembly line.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
What can you cook?<br/>
Minny dips pieces of chicken in an egg wash, then drops them&#160;<br/>in a paper bag. &#160;A puff of flour rises out of the bag. Celia&#160;<br/>searches her brain for the right answer.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I can cook corn&#160;pone...boil<br/>eggs...and&#160;potatoes, and do grits.<br/>
Minny bursts out laughing.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Well, I reckon if there's anything&#160;<br/>you ought to know 'bout cooking...<br/>
Minny holds up a can of&#160;Crisco.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
It's this. &#160;The most important&#160;<br/>invention since they put mayonnaise&#160;<br/>in a jar. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=76></a>75.<br/>
Minny scoops out a mound of&#160;Crisco&#160;with a spoon.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Got gum in your hair? &#160;Got a squeaky&#160;<br/>door hinge? &#160;Crisco.<br/>
Minny drops the&#160;Crisco&#160;into a hot skillet. &#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
How pretty. &#160;Looks like frosting.<br/>
MINNY (V.0.)<br/>
Got bags under your eyes? &#160;Wanna&#160;<br/>soften your husband's scaly feet? &#160;<br/>Crisco. &#160;But it's best for&#160;fryin'<br/>chicken. &#160;And&#160;fryin'&#160;chicken makes&#160;<br/>you feel better about life. &#160;At&#160;<br/>least me, anyway. &#160;Mmm. &#160;I love me&#160;<br/>some fried chicken.<br/>
Minny hands the bag to Celia.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Shake that.<br/>
Celia starts shaking the bag wildly.<br/>
She laughs.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
This is so much fun!<br/>
Minnie takes the bag away from Celia.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
All right, all right. &#160;The chicken&#160;<br/>already dead, Miss Celia.<br/>
Minny peeks into the bag.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Yep. &#160;He dead.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - KITCHEN -&#160;LATER THAT DAY<br/>
Minny sits alone at a table for two by a window. &#160;She unfolds&#160;<br/>her napkin and places it over her lap. &#160;Just as she's about&#160;<br/>to bite into a crispy chicken wing, Celia enters from the&#160;<br/>dining room with her plate.&#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
There you are.<br/>
She sits at Minny's table.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=77></a>76.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I'm starved. &#160;It looks so good!<br/>
MINNY<br/>
We done been over this, Miss Celia. &#160;<br/>You supposed to eat in the&#160;dinin'<br/>room. &#160;That how it work. &#160;<br/>
Minny grabs Celia's plate.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Here,&#160;let me take your plate back--<br/>
CELIA&#160;<br/>
No! &#160;I'm fine right here, Minny.<br/>
Minny sits back down with a sigh. &#160;Celia sits, sinks her&#160;<br/>teeth into one of the tastiest chicken legs she's ever had. &#160;<br/>She gasps.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
What?<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I just want you to&#160;know...I'm&#160;real&#160;<br/>grateful you're here.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You&#160;gots&#160;plenty more to be grateful&#160;<br/>for than me. &#160;And look, now I ain't&#160;<br/>messin'&#160;around no more. &#160;Mister&#160;<br/>Johnny gone catch me here and shoot&#160;<br/>me dead right here on this no-wax&#160;<br/>floor! &#160;You&#160;gots&#160;to tell him. &#160;Ain't&#160;<br/>he wondering how the&#160;cookin's&#160;so&#160;<br/>good?<br/>
CELIA&#160;FOOTE<br/>
You're right. &#160;Maybe we ought to&#160;<br/>burn the chicken a little.<br/>
Minny lowers her piece of chicken and looks directly into&#160;<br/>Celia's eyes.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Minny don't burn chicken.<br/>
INT. MISS STEIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NEW YORK - NIGHT<br/>
Miss Stein sits alone in bed. Work papers are scattered all&#160;<br/>around her. &#160;She discusses Aibileen and Minny's stories with&#160;<br/>Skeeter on the phone.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=78></a>77.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
I like this &#34;Sarah Ross.&#34; &#160;She&#160;<br/>testifies without complaining too&#160;<br/>much.<br/>
INT- AIBILEEN'S HOME (INTERCUT) - KITCHEN - NIGHT<br/>
Skeeter nods rapidly. &#160;Aibileen and Minny sit at the kitchen&#160;<br/>table listening in.<br/>
MISS STEIN&#160;<br/>
And that &#34;Bertha&#34;...she's got&#160;<br/>chutzpah. &#160;I'll give her that. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
So...you&#160;liked it?<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
Eugenia, Martin Luther King just&#160;<br/>invited the country to march with&#160;<br/>him in D.C.&#160;in&#160;August. This many&#160;<br/>Negroes&#160;and whites haven't worked&#160;<br/>together since&#160;<i>Gone with the Wind.<br/></i>How many stories have you recorded&#160;<br/>thus far?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
The ones you've read.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
Two domestics?! &#160;That all?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'm real close to getting more&#160;<br/>interviews.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
(big sigh)<br/>
Don't send me&#160;<i>anything&#160;</i>more until&#160;<br/>you&#160;<i>do have&#160;</i>more maids.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Yes, Ma'am. &#160;How, how many more?&#160;<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
I don't know. &#160;At least a dozen. &#160;<br/>And&#160;my advice is to write it and&#160;<br/>write it fast before this whole&#160;<br/>civil rights thing blows over. &#160;Now&#160;<br/>good night to you, Miss&#160;Phelan.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=79></a>78.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter hangs up the phone and sits down at the kitchen table&#160;<br/>with Minny and Aibileen.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
We need a dozen more.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Me and Aibileen done asked&#160;everbody<br/>we know. &#160;Thirty-one maids. &#160;They&#160;<br/>all too scared, think we crazy...<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well if we don't get more, we're not&#160;<br/>getting published.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I&#160;gots&#160;plenty a stories, Miss&#160;<br/>Skeeter. &#160;Just write 'em down and&#160;<br/>invent the maid that said it. &#160;<br/>You're already making up names. &#160;<br/>Just make up the maids, too.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
We're not&#160;gonna&#160;do that. &#160;That would&#160;<br/>be wrong.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen's breath becomes heavy.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
It wouldn't be real.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN&#160;<br/>
They killed my son.<br/>
Skeeter looks up in shock. &#160;Minny tries to console Aibileen.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
He fell carrying two by fours at the&#160;<br/>mill. &#160;Truck run over him, crushed&#160;<br/>his lungs.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Aibileen...<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
That white foreman threw his body on&#160;<br/>the back of a truck. &#160;Drove to the&#160;<br/>colored hospital and dumped him&#160;<br/>there and honked the horn. &#160;<br/>
(MORE)<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=80></a>79.<br/>
AIBILEEN&#160;(CONT'D)<br/>
There was&#160;nothin'&#160;they could&#160;do...so<br/>I brought my baby home. &#160;Laid him&#160;<br/>down on that sofa right there. &#160;He&#160;<br/>died right in front of me. Just&#160;<br/>twenty-four years old, Miss Skeeter. &#160;<br/>Best part of a person's life. &#160;<br/>Anniversary of his death come every&#160;<br/>year and I can't breathe. &#160;But to&#160;<br/>y'all&#160;it's just another day of&#160;<br/>bridge.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter reaches out to Aibileen. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You stop this, everything I wrote,&#160;<br/>he wrote... everything he&#160;was...gone<br/>die with him.<br/>
Aibileen rises and quickly leaves the room. &#160;<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAY<br/>
A BOY slides down a water slide into the&#160;Holbrook&#160;pool.<br/>
HILLY (O.C.)<br/>
I'm just honored to be hosting&#160;<br/>Elizabeth's shower.<br/>
Hilly, the bridge girls and other attendees eat lunch at&#160;<br/>three separate tables in close proximity.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
And just, doesn't she look glowing,&#160;<br/>everybody? &#160;Yes, she does!&#160;<br/>
Each table seats six and is covered in white linens and&#160;<br/>Hilly's best silver.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Honey, you hold on to it to the&#160;<br/>bitter end, you hear, now?<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
I'll try.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Well, congratulations.<br/>
Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby&#160;<br/>shower.&#160;&#160;Aibileen serves Hilly's table while&#160;Yule May makes&#160;<br/>iced tea.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=81></a>80.<br/>
Mae Mobley wanders up to the table&#160;and approaches Elizabeth.&#160;&#160;<br/>Her belly almost looks distended crammed inside last year's&#160;<br/>one piece.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
I'm hungry, Momma.<br/>
Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.&#160;<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
She's always hungry.<br/>
All the women laugh except for Skeeter.&#160;&#160;Skeeter scowls.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You know she can hear you,&#160;<br/>Elizabeth?<br/>
Elizabeth lowers her iced tea and looks away.<br/>
Aibileen&#160;<br/>
kneels down to Mae Mobley.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I'll cut you a piece of cake, Baby.<br/>
Hilly&#160;looks quizzically to Skeeter's satchel. &#160;She sees the&#160;<br/>pamphlet of Mississippi laws sticking out of&#160;the side of the&#160;<br/>satchel.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new&#160;<br/>bathroom over at Elizabeth's? &#160;<br/>
Aibileen and Skeeter instinctively lock eyes for a moment. &#160;<br/>Hilly immediately sees this. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Nice to have your own, isn't it,&#160;<br/>Aibileen?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yes, Ma'am. &#160;And I thank you.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Separate but equal. &#160;That's what&#160;<br/>Ross Barnett says, and you can't&#160;<br/>argue with the governor.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, certainly not in Mississippi. &#160;<br/>Birthplace of modern day government.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=82></a>81.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY<br/>
Yule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their&#160;<br/>&#34;good-byes&#34; on the street. &#160;Skeeter slips into the kitchen.&#160;<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Oh hey, Miss Skeeter. &#160;Can I get you&#160;<br/>something?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
No, thanks. &#160;Yule May, I wanted to&#160;<br/>talk to you about something.<br/>
Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still&#160;<br/>cackling out on the street.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
I already know what you're&#160;gonna<br/>ask, Miss Skeeter. &#160;Minny and&#160;<br/>Aibileen already did. &#160;I'm trying to&#160;<br/>get my boys off to college. It's&#160;<br/>worthwhile what&#160;y'all&#160;doin', but my&#160;<br/>boys are worth more.<br/>
Hilly enters the kitchen carrying Billy. &#160;She stops behind&#160;<br/>Skeeter, suspicious.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I understand.<br/>
HILLY&#160;<br/>
What do you &#34;understand&#34;, Skeeter?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Ah...Yule&#160;May was just saying how&#160;<br/>excited she was that her boys are&#160;<br/>gonna&#160;go off to college.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
(to Yule May)<br/>
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you&#160;<br/>could borrow money?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Of course not!<br/>
Yule May drops her dish towel in the sink and approaches&#160;<br/>Hilly.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
I'm&#160;gonna&#160;put Billy down for his&#160;<br/>nap. &#160;Excuse me.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=83></a>82.<br/>
Hilly kisses Billy. &#160;Yule May takes&#160;Billy from Hilly&#160;and&#160;<br/>exits. &#160;Hilly turns to Skeeter. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Skeeter, are you intentionally not&#160;<br/>putting my initiative in the&#160;<br/>newsletter?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
No, no, not at all. &#160;I've just been&#160;<br/>really busy with Momma. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I know. &#160;I know, you must be so&#160;<br/>worried about your mother, but,&#160;<br/>um...&#160;<br/>
Hilly reveals that she's been holding the&#160;pamphlet of&#160;<br/>Mississippi race laws&#160;that were in Skeeter's satchel.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
...I'm worried about you.&#160;Readin'<br/><i>this&#160;</i>stuff? &#160;Believe it or not,&#160;<br/>there are&#160;real&#160;<i>racists&#160;</i>in this town! &#160;<br/>If the wrong person caught you with&#160;<br/>anything like that you'd be in&#160;<br/>serious trouble.<br/>
Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I'll be on the lookout.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Put my initiative in the newsletter.&#160;<br/>'Kay?<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT<br/>
Skeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette. Keys type&#160;<br/>out: CHARITY DRIVE - Come by the&#160;Holbrooks'&#160;and drop off your&#160;<br/>old coats.<br/>
Skeeter stops typing and looks to a framed picture of her and&#160;<br/>Hilly in college during happier times. &#160;She is lost in&#160;<br/>thought for a&#160;moment...she&#160;then grabs the picture and puts it&#160;<br/>in her desk drawer.&#160;<br/>
Then she smiles devilishly as she backs up several spaces and&#160;<br/>reaches for LIQUID PAPER. &#160;With two strokes she paints over&#160;<br/>the word &#34;coats&#34;.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=84></a>83.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - SKEETER'S BEDROOM -&#160;NEXT MORNING<br/>
Having pulled an &#34;all-nighter,&#34; Skeeter naps in her room.&#160;<br/>Charlotte suddenly bursts into the room, stuck somewhere&#160;<br/>between panic and joy.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Skeeter! Get up!&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What?!&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
We got to get dressed.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What's wrong?<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Don't panic, but there's a&#160;<br/><i>particularly tall&#160;</i>and very handsome&#160;<br/>man named Stuart here for you.<br/>
Charlotte rushes to Skeeter's closet and pulls out a dress.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh, God. &#160;Oh, mother, you would not&#160;<br/>like him. &#160;Trust me. &#160;He's a drunken&#160;<br/>asshole.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Love and hate are two horns on the&#160;<br/>same goat, Eugenia. &#160;And you need a&#160;<br/>goat! &#160;Put that on. &#160;Hurry!<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - DAY<br/>
Charlotte stands on her balcony watering plants, but her&#160;<br/>attention is focused on Skeeter and Stuart. &#160;The stream of&#160;<br/>water misses the plants and&#160;spills everywhere.<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - BACK YARD - WILLOW TREE - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter and Stuart sit on the bench beneath the willow tree.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Look. I know it was a few weeks&#160;<br/>back, but I came here to say I'm&#160;<br/>sorry for the way I acted.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Who sent you? &#160;William or Hilly?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=85></a>84.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Neither.<br/>
Skeeter shoots Stuart a look.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Okay, Hilly. &#160;But, I wanted to come. &#160;<br/>I was rude, and I've been thinking&#160;<br/>about it a lot.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I haven't. &#160;So you can just&#160;<br/>go.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Goddammit!<br/>
He stands and fixes his tie.<br/>
STUART<br/>
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go&#160;<br/>out on any date, all right? &#160;Wasn't&#160;<br/>even close to ready.<br/>
Stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy. &#160;Skeeter&#160;<br/>turns to the balcony and sees&#160;her mother pretending to prune&#160;<br/>a plant.<br/>
STUART<br/>
I was engaged last year. &#160;She ended&#160;<br/>it.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'm sure she did.<br/>
STUART<br/>
It's not like that. &#160;I'm not always&#160;<br/>a jerk.<br/>
Anyway, we'd been dating&#160;<br/>
since we were fifteen. &#160;You know how&#160;<br/>it is.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Actually, I don't. &#160;I've never&#160;<br/>really dated anyone before.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Ever?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Ever.<br/>
Stuart chuckles.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=86></a>85.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Well, that must be it then.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What?!<br/>
STUART<br/>
Skeeter, I've never met a woman that&#160;<br/>says exactly what she's thinking.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I've&#160;got plenty to say.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Yeah, I'll bet you do. &#160;You make me&#160;<br/>laugh...and&#160;smile. &#160;Would you&#160;<br/>a....would&#160;you like to come have&#160;<br/>dinner with me? &#160;We could talk. &#160;I&#160;<br/>could actually listen to you this&#160;<br/>time.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I can't think of anything worse.<br/>
Stuart looks down.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Well, I understand and I'm sorry. &#160;<br/>That's what I came to say&#160;and...I<br/>said it.<br/>
Stuart turns and walks towards his car, self-consciously&#160;<br/>weaving his strong fingers through his hair.<br/>
Skeeter looks up to the Charlotte-free&#160;balcony&#160;and shouts out&#160;<br/>to Stuart.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Just give me a minute!<br/>
Stuart turns.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Let me get my sweater.<br/>
INT.&#160;MAYFLOWER&#160;CAFE - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Skeeter and Stuart&#160;sit in a booth of a cafe in front of a&#160;<br/>plate of&#160;raw oysters.<br/>
Skeeter dips a cracker in ketchup.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=87></a>86.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Not a big fan of oysters, huh?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oysters are a vehicle for crackers&#160;<br/>and ketchup.<br/>
Stuart picks up an oyster&#160;and extends it for a toast.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Well, here's to new beginnings.<br/>
Skeeter takes a beat and taps&#160;the oyster&#160;shell&#160;Stuart is&#160;<br/>holding&#160;with her cracker.&#160;<br/>
Stuart sucks down the oyster with a big slurping noise.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You're disgusting.<br/>
STUART&#160;<br/>
You've already made that pretty&#160;<br/>clear.<br/>
Skeeter smiles and take a sip of her beer.<br/>
STUART (CONT'D)<br/>
Just so you know, the boys caught me&#160;<br/>reading your Miss Myrna column on&#160;<br/>the rig the other day.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Really? &#160;You read 'em?<br/>
STUART<br/>
All of 'em. Very informative,&#160;too. I&#160;<br/>never knew ground egg shells got&#160;<br/>grease out of clothes.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I do my homework.<br/>
Stuart reaches over and touches Skeeter's hand.&#160;Skeeter&#160;<br/>stiffens but doesn't protest.<br/>
STUART<br/>
You're a good writer, Skeeter.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Thank you. I want to be a&#160;<br/>journalist. &#160;Maybe a novelist. &#160;<br/>Maybe both.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=88></a>87.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Well, I like that. You're really&#160;<br/>smart. And pretty.<br/>
Skeeter blushes. &#160;<br/>
EXT.&#160;MAYFLOWER&#160;CAFE - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Stuart follows Skeeter out of the restaurant. &#160;He suddenly&#160;<br/>stops her and spins her around. &#160;<br/>
STUART<br/>
Skeeter, I hope you get to write&#160;<br/>something really good. &#160;Something&#160;<br/>you believe in.<br/>
Stuart and Skeeter kiss under the cafe's flashing neon sign.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING<br/>
Aibileen sits on the couch reading a book with Mae Mobley who&#160;<br/>eats a cookie. &#160;<br/>
The phone rings. &#160;Elizabeth answers in the next room.<br/>
ELIZABETH (O.S.)<br/>
Hello? &#160;What?? &#160;I'm coming!<br/>
Elizabeth runs into the room.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Aibileen! &#160;Come on! &#160;We have to go&#160;<br/>help Hilly. &#160;Now! &#160;Come on!<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Hilly flies out of her house, crying, as a REPORTER snaps a&#160;<br/>picture.<br/>
Hilly charges the reporter.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You're trespassing!<br/>
Hilly&#160;pushes&#160;the reporter&#160;into the bushes and runs to&#160;<br/>Elizabeth, who stands&#160;with Aibileen&#160;and Mae Mobley on&#160;the&#160;<br/>lawn.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Skeeter!<br/>
She put it in the&#160;<br/>
newsletter.<br/>
A crowd of people look on, laughing.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=89></a>88.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Oh, my God.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I specifically said&#160;<i>old coats&#160;</i>are to&#160;<br/>be dropped at my house. &#160;Not&#160;<br/>commodes! &#160;<br/>
Pull back to reveal FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape and&#160;<br/>color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Why would she do this to me?<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
I don't know. &#160;I don't know, Hilly.<br/>
Hilly walks to her &#34;Yard of the Month&#34; sign and grabs it.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
(sobbing)<br/>
It's so... embarrassing.<br/>
Onlookers laugh, take photos and point at Mae Mobley.&#160;-<br/>
Aibileen turns to see Mae Mobley&#160;sitting&#160;on one of the&#160;<br/>toilets with her underwear around her ankles, smiling&#160;<br/>proudly.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
(sotto)<br/>
Oh, Lord.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
I go potty, Mommy.<br/>
Elizabeth turns and&#160;sees her daughter. &#160;Horrified,&#160;she&#160;runs&#160;<br/>over to Mae Mobley, picks her up off the toilet and spanks&#160;<br/>her HARD.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
No! &#160;Mae Mobley! &#160;Get off of that&#160;<br/>toilet!<br/>
A PHOTOGRAPHER captures&#160;the moment.<br/>
Mae Mobley begins to&#160;<br/>
cry.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
You will catch diseases, do you hear&#160;<br/>me? &#160;You will catch diseases on&#160;<br/>those toilets.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=90></a>89.<br/>
EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - YARD - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen&#160;carries&#160;Mae Mobley away from the toilets&#160;and&#160;then&#160;<br/>kneels in front of her in a corner of&#160;the lawn.&#160;<br/>
Tears stream down Mae Mobley's face.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
(to Mae Mobley)<br/>
You is kind, you is smart, you is&#160;<br/>important.<br/>
Aibileen gives Mae Mobley a motherly hug.&#160;&#160;Elizabeth watches&#160;<br/>the exchange from Hilly's front door.<br/>
Upset, Elizabeth&#160;marches into Hilly's house&#160;and shuts the&#160;<br/>door.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON<br/>
Skeeter, Pascagoula and&#160;Jameso&#160;watch television as&#160;Medgar<br/>Evers&#160;speaks at a news conference on the local news.<br/>
Stock footage plays of this actual news conference.<br/>
MEDGAR&#160;EVERS<br/>
Don't shop for anything on Capital&#160;<br/>Street. &#160;Let's let the merchants&#160;<br/>down on Capital Street feel the&#160;<br/>economic pinch. Let me say to you.&#160;<br/>
Charlotte walks past the living room and stops to see what&#160;<br/>they are all watching.<br/>
MEDGAR&#160;EVERS<br/>
I had one merchant to call me and he&#160;<br/>said &#34;I want you to know that I&#160;<br/>talked to my national office today&#160;<br/>and they want me to tell you we&#160;<br/>don't need&#160;nigger&#160;business.&#34; &#160;These&#160;<br/>are the stores that help support the&#160;<br/>White Citizen's Council. &#160;A council&#160;<br/>that is dedicated to keeping you and&#160;<br/>I second class citizens.&#160;<br/>
Charlotte storms into the room and turns off the television.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Momma!<br/>
Charlotte glares at Pascagoula and&#160;Jameso&#160;as they&#160;<br/>instinctively walk briskly away and out the front door. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=91></a>90.<br/>
Charlotte grabs Skeeter by the arm.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Don't encourage them like that.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
This is national news!<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
I won't have it! &#160; Do you&#160;<br/>understand?&#160;<br/>
Skeeter jerks her arm away and leaves the room.<br/>
INT. BUS - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Aibileen rides in the back of a bus across the aisle from &#160;<br/>Henry, the waiter from Brent's. &#160;The white passengers ride up&#160;<br/>front.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
How you&#160;doin', Miss Clark?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
All&#160;right, Henry. Thank you. &#160;How&#160;<br/>you doing?<br/>
HENRY<br/>
If God is willing, Miss Clark. &#160;If&#160;<br/>God is willing.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
That's good.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
It's good.<br/>
The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road. &#160;A siren&#160;<br/>is heard. &#160;In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a&#160;<br/>road block. &#160;A few people gather. &#160;<br/>
The DRIVER stands and faces the passengers.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
What's going on out there, mister?<br/>
DRIVER<br/>
Colored people off. &#160;The rest of&#160;<br/>you, lemme know where you're going. &#160;<br/>I'll get you as close as I can.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=92></a>91.<br/>
Henry helps Aibileen down the aisle. A&#160;white passenger taps&#160;<br/>the driver on the shoulder.<br/>
WHITE PASSENGER<br/>
What happened?<br/>
DRIVER<br/>
I don't know. &#160;Some&#160;nigger&#160;got shot. &#160;<br/>Where you headed?<br/>
Aibileen and Henry exit. &#160;The bus door shuts.<br/>
EXT.&#160;JACKSON&#160;STREET - MINUTES LATER<br/>
Aibileen and Henry walk along a dark street. &#160;The sound of&#160;<br/>cicadas and sirens fill the air. &#160;Over a megaphone, a&#160;<br/>POLICEMAN orders people to clear the street; there's a curfew&#160;<br/>in effect.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
You gone be all&#160;right, Miss Clark? &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I be all right. &#160;You go on now,&#160;<br/>Henry.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
You want me to walk ya?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
No, thank you. I'll be all&#160;right.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
Well, you have a good night.<br/>
Henry peels off and runs in the opposite direction. &#160;Aibileen &#160;<br/>suddenly grows nervous.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Which way you&#160;goin'?<br/>
Aibileen turns to discover Henry's already gone. &#160;Another&#160;<br/>round of sirens sounds in the distance. &#160;As the sirens&#160;<br/>intensify, Aibileen grows scared and starts to run. &#160;<br/>
We hear the O.S.&#160;voice&#160;of activist Roy Wilkins on a radio.<br/>
ROY WILKINS (O.S.)<br/>
...We view this as a cold, brutal&#160;<br/>deliberate killing in a savage,&#160;<br/>uncivilized state. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=93></a>92.<br/>
EXT. AIBILEEN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen, still running, has now reached the edge of her&#160;<br/>neighborhood. &#160;A police car whizzes past her.<br/>
ROY WILKINS (O.S.)<br/>
There is not a state with a record&#160;<br/>that approaches that of Mississippi&#160;<br/>in inhumanity, murder, brutality,&#160;<br/>and racial hatred.<br/>
Suddenly a rush of black residents run panicked past&#160;<br/>Aibileen. &#160;Aibileen trips and falls hard to her knees. &#160;<br/>
Terrified, she rises and continues on her way.<br/>
ROY WILKINS (O.S.)<br/>
It is absolutely at the bottom of&#160;<br/>the list.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen runs through hanging laundry outside Minny's house.&#160;&#160;<br/>We now hear the voice of a local radio announcer's account of&#160;<br/>the evening's events.<br/>
RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)<br/>
Fifteen minutes past midnight,&#160;Evers<br/>got out of his car beside his home&#160;<br/>in a Negro residential area. &#160;<br/>
INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN<br/>
Minny sits with all five of her children listening anxiously&#160;<br/>to a radio on the table.&#160;<br/>
RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)<br/>
In a vacant lot about forty yards&#160;<br/>away, a sniper fired a single shot&#160;<br/>from a high-powered rifle at&#160;Evers'<br/>silhouette...<br/>
Aibileen opens the screen door and enters. &#160;Minny sees the&#160;<br/>blood and grass stains streaking the knees of Aibileen's&#160;<br/>panty hose and jumps up to help her.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Minny, you all&#160;right?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You all&#160;right? I'm all&#160;right. Sit&#160;<br/>down. You all&#160;right?<br/>
Aibileen nods, sits, trying to compose herself.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=94></a>93.<br/>
RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)<br/>
The bullet hit him in the back,&#160;<br/>crashed through his body, through a&#160;<br/>window, into the house. &#160;He died&#160;<br/>within an hour at a Jackson&#160;<br/>hospital...<br/>
MINNY<br/>
KKK shot him! &#160;Hour ago. &#160;Right in&#160;<br/>front a his children, Aibileen.<br/>
Minny kneels before Aibileen and wipes her leg with a cloth. &#160;<br/>Aibileen wipes away tears with a tissue.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
We gone pray for the&#160;Evers. &#160;We gone&#160;<br/>pray for&#160;Myrlie.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
We living in hell! &#160;We trapped. &#160;Our&#160;<br/>kids is trapped.<br/>
The MAYOR begins giving a statement over the radio.<br/>
Minny&#160;<br/>
suddenly turns to her children.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Sugar, take your brothers and&#160;<br/>sisters and&#160;y'all&#160;go on to bed.<br/>
Sugar leads the kids to the back of the house. &#160;Minny says&#160;<br/>&#34;good night&#34; to each child. &#160;When they are gone, Minny turns&#160;<br/>to Aibileen.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
What they gone do to us if they&#160;<br/>catch us with Miss Skeeter?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
We gone be careful.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Hitch us to a pickup and drag us&#160;<br/>behind? &#160;Shoot me front a my&#160;<br/>children?&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
We ain't doing civil rights. &#160;We&#160;<br/>just&#160;tellin'&#160;stories like they&#160;<br/>really happen.<br/>
Minny and Aibileen grab hands and squeeze hard.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You a fool, old woman. &#160;A fool!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=95></a>94.<br/>
Aibileen hugs Minny. &#160;They laugh a little through the tears.<br/>
INT. JACKSON JOURNAL - MORGUE - DAY<br/>
Skeeter works at a table sheltered behind a tall basket of&#160;<br/>Miss Myrna letters. In reality, she's working on her and&#160;<br/>Aibileen's book of stories.<br/>
Skeeter scans past articles she has pulled dealing with&#160;<br/>racial injustices. (Inserts of various real headlines and&#160;<br/>photos).<br/>
A copy of Life magazine is next to her notebook.&#160;<br/>
CLOSE ON:<br/>
On the cover,&#160;Myrlie&#160;Evers&#160;comforts her crying son at&#160;Medgar<br/>Evers'&#160;funeral.<br/>
Mr. Blackly sticks his head in the room. Skeeter quickly&#160;<br/>covers her research with her notebook and looks up.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Miss&#160;Phelan! Presses are heating up! &#160;<br/>I needed&#160;&#34;Miss&#160;Myrna&#34; thirty&#160;minutes&#160;<br/>ago.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Yes, sir.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Chop-chop.<br/>
(sighs)<br/>
Good&#160;Lord.<br/>
Mr. Blackly slams the door.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE -&#160;TROPHY&#160;ROOM - MORNING<br/>
Minny vacuums a huge stuffed bear that stands on its hind&#160;<br/>legs. &#160;She hears a loud THUMP from upstairs. She gets down&#160;<br/>from a footstool and turns off the vacuum.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Miss Celia?<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;HOME - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Minny walks into&#160;Celia's&#160;bedroom and hears water running&#160;<br/>joined with muffled crying behind the bathroom door. &#160;She&#160;<br/>leans in, pressing her ear to the door.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=96></a>95.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Miss Celia?&#160;<br/>
CELIA (O.S.)<br/>
Minny, go home. &#160;I'll see you&#160;<br/>tomorrow.<br/>
Minny twists the knob.&#160;It's locked.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You mess up your hair coloring&#160;<br/>again? &#160;I helped you fix it last&#160;<br/>time. &#160;We got it back to butter&#160;<br/>batch. &#160;It was real pretty,&#160;<br/>remember? &#160;Miss Celia.<br/>
Minny twists the knob again.<br/>
CELIA (O.S.)<br/>
I told you, go home!<br/>
Minny steps a few feet back and pauses. &#160;She takes a deep&#160;<br/>breath of courage and charges the door with all her might.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS<br/>
The bathroom door flies open along with splinters of wood. &#160;<br/>Minny sees Celia sitting against the wall next to the toilet&#160;<br/>in a bloody nightgown, sobbing. &#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I said get out!<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Oh. Oh, Lord.<br/>
Minny kneels by Celia.<br/>
Celia looks up to Minny shamefully.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Why is there so much blood?&#160;<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;HOME - BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY<br/>
Celia lies in bed as Minny drapes a rag across her forehead.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Next one&#160;gonna&#160;catch, Miss Celia. &#160;<br/>You just wait and see.<br/>
Celia stares outside of her bedroom window.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=97></a>96.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
We got married because I got&#160;<br/>pregnant,&#160;but then I lost it a month&#160;<br/>later. &#160;Johnny wants kids now. &#160;<br/>What's he&#160;gonna&#160;do with me?&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Well, Mister Johnny gone just have&#160;<br/>to get over it.<br/>
CELIA&#160;<br/>
He doesn't know about this&#160;baby...or<br/>the two before.&#160;<br/>
This news hits Minny hard. &#160;Realization crosses her face.<br/>
EXT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - YARD - THE NEXT DAY<br/>
Celia&#160;finishes&#160;digging&#160;a hole&#160;next to two existing&#160;<br/>rosebushes.<br/>
A shoebox sits&#160;on the ground beside&#160;the hole as&#160;<br/>
well as new&#160;rosebush&#160;waiting&#160;to be planted. &#160;<br/>
Celia&#160;lowers the shoebox into the hole and covers it with&#160;<br/>dirt and then plants the new rosebush&#160;on top to complete the&#160;<br/>burial of her third miscarried child.<br/>
EXT. BUS STOP - WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD - NEXT MORNING<br/>
Aibileen, Yule May and several other maids exit the bus to&#160;<br/>begin the day's work.<br/>
TWO POLICE OFFICERS stand by a police cruiser. &#160;As Yule May&#160;<br/>hits the pavement, the officers&#160;approach her.<br/>
COP<br/>
Yule May Davis?<br/>
Before Yule May can answer, the officers grab her forcefully.<br/>
COP<br/>
You're under arrest.<br/>
Aibileen takes Yule May's purse as Yule May is carried away&#160;<br/>by the police.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
What do you want me to do?<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Call my husband.<br/>
A third police officer pushes Aibileen away from Yule May. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=98></a>97.<br/>
Aibileen watches helplessly as the officers drag Yule May to&#160;<br/>a squad car.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Wait a minute. &#160;I want my purse.<br/>
POLICE OFFICER<br/>
No. &#160;You're under arrest, ma'am.<br/>
Yule May begins to resist.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
I want to get my purse! &#160;I want to&#160;<br/>get my purse! &#160;Aibee!<br/>
Aibileen struggles to break free from the police officer who&#160;<br/>restrains her.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Don't fight, Yule May!<br/>
Hilly sits in her station wagon, watching the arrest.<br/>
YULE MAY<br/>
Aibee! &#160;I want my purse! &#160;I want my&#160;<br/>purse! &#160;Just let me get...<br/>
The two police officers&#160;slam&#160;Yule May&#160;down hard on the back&#160;<br/>of the trunk of the police cruiser.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Yule May, don't fight...<br/>
One of officers&#160;pulls out a billy club and strikes&#160;Yule May&#160;<br/>on the head. &#160;<br/>
Yule May goes limp.<br/>
A group of white women with their&#160;<br/>
children all look away.<br/>
Hilly continues to watch with little emotion as Yule May is&#160;<br/>placed in the back of the cruiser.<br/>
HILLY (O.S.)<br/>
I knew she was a thief the day she&#160;<br/>started.<br/>
INT. BRENT'S DRUGS - NEXT AFTERNOON<br/>
Skeeter sits at the soda fountain counter eating alone. &#160;<br/>Behind her, Hilly, a visibly pregnant Elizabeth, Jolene and&#160;<br/>Mary&#160;Beth enter and meander down the shopping aisles. &#160;Hilly&#160;<br/>holds her son, Billy. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=99></a>98.<br/>
Skeeter looks back to the trio as Hilly recalls her morning.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
... A nigra walks into a pawn shop&#160;<br/>with a ring of such size and color? &#160;<br/>It took them all of ten minutes to&#160;<br/>find out where she worked.&#160;<br/>
The women find an empty booth and sit.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I am desperate for a grilled cheese&#160;<br/>sandwich. &#160;<br/>
BACK AT THE COUNTER<br/>
Henry, the fry cook, walks over to Skeeter's place at the&#160;<br/>counter. &#160;He intimates that he has something to tell her.&#160;<br/>Careful not to look at her, he busies himself with work as he&#160;<br/>mumbles.<br/>
HENRY<br/>
Miss Skeeter, you best get over to&#160;<br/>Miss Aibileen's house. &#160;Now.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT&#160;<br/>AFTERNOON<br/>
Skeeter enters quickly through Aibileen's kitchen door and is&#160;<br/>surprised to see twenty other black women in uniform standing&#160;<br/>solemnly around in the living room. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen motions for Skeeter to move closer.<br/>
Skeeter&#160;<br/>
approaches nervously. &#160;<br/>
PEARLY/CHURCH WOMAN<br/>
I'm gone help with your stories.<br/>
Another WOMAN walks over.<br/>
BLACK WOMAN<br/>
I'm gone help,&#160;too. &#160;<br/>
Another woman speaks from the living room.<br/>
BLACK WOMAN 2<br/>
We all are.<br/>
Women of all ages nod their heads. Skeeter looks around in&#160;<br/>awe.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=100></a>99.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter is taking notes.&#160;CALLIE, 60, takes off her glasses&#160;<br/>and wipes her eyes.<br/>
CALLIE<br/>
I used to take a shortcut ever day&#160;<br/>to work at Doctor Dixon's house. Cut&#160;<br/>through this farmer's lower forty to&#160;<br/>get there. &#160;One day, that farmer was&#160;<br/>waitin'&#160;on me with a gun, said he'd&#160;<br/>shoot me dead if I walk on his land&#160;<br/>again. &#160;Doctor Dixon went and paid&#160;<br/>that farmer double for two a those&#160;<br/>acres. &#160;Told him he 'bout to start&#160;<br/>farmin',&#160;too. &#160;But he bought it just&#160;<br/>for me. &#160;So I could get to work&#160;<br/>easy. &#160;He did.<br/>
LATER<br/>
CORA<br/>
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother&#160;<br/>'til the day she died. &#160;Then her&#160;<br/>daughter, Miss Nancy, asked me to&#160;<br/>come and work for her. &#160;Miss Nancy's&#160;<br/>a real sweet lady. &#160;But Miss&#160;<br/>Jolene's ma done put it in her will&#160;<br/>I got to work for Miss Jolene. &#160;Miss&#160;<br/>Jolene's a mean woman. &#160;Mean for&#160;<br/>sport. &#160;Lord, I tried to find&#160;<br/>another job. &#160;But in everybody's&#160;<br/>mind the French family and Miss&#160;<br/>Jolene owned me. &#160;Owned me.<br/>
Skeeter and Aibileen catch eyes for a moment. Then Skeeter&#160;<br/>resumes taking notes.<br/>
INT. NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY<br/>
A phone has been brought to Miss Stein's table. &#160;She's having&#160;<br/>a working lunch with two other publishing types. &#160;<br/>
She sips a Martini while talking to Skeeter.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
I leave early this week for&#160;<br/>Thanksgiving and then our last&#160;<br/>editor's meeting is December 17th. &#160;<br/>If you want a prayer of this getting&#160;<br/>read, I need it by then. &#160;<br/>

INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - PANTRY (INTERCUT) - &#160;DAY<br/>
Skeeter talks to Miss Stein on the phone.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
But that's in three weeks, Miss&#160;<br/>Stein!<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
Otherwise it goes in&#160;<i>The Pile</i>. &#160;<br/>
Miss Stein smirks knowingly to her&#160;co-workers.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
You don't want it in&#160;<i>The Pile</i>.<br/>
The&#160;co-workers&#160;snicker at Miss Stein's remark.<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
Yes, Ma'am.<br/>
MISS STEIN<br/>
And put something personal in there. &#160;<br/>Write about the maid who raised you.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I understand.<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - DAY<br/>
Celia drives a bright red car up the driveway to Elizabeth's&#160;<br/>house where other&#160;bridge girls'&#160;cars are parked.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DEN&#160;- MOMENTS LATER<br/>
A room full of bridge&#160;girls sit at card tables eating lunch.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Well, we have a lot of work to do&#160;<br/>before the benefit, don't we?<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I know, but I think we're on track. &#160;<br/>I think we're doing quite well.<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME -&#160;(INTERCUT) -&#160;SAME TIME<br/>
Celia carries a pie to the front door and rings the bell.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Who's there?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=102></a>101.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
I don't know. Aibileen?<br/>
Aibileen takes a step down into the room.<br/>
CELIA&#160;<br/>
Hey, Elizabeth! &#160;It's me, Celia&#160;<br/>Foote! &#160;I was in the neighborhood,&#160;<br/>thought I'd drop by.<br/>
Hilly signals to everyone to hide.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Oh.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Everybody hide. &#160;Everybody get down,&#160;<br/>get down.<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
Turn off the music.<br/>
The girls giggle as they kneel down behind furniture. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen backs up the stairs and hides against the wall.<br/>
Celia steps into the flower bed near the window and knocks on&#160;<br/>the glass. &#160;She spies the girls kneeling in the room but&#160;<br/>doesn't get what's happening.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Hey!&#160;I...brought&#160;a chocolate&#160;<br/>pie...My&#160;maid, Minny, made it.<br/>
Hilly's face hardens. &#160;The other girls laugh and giggle.<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - DAY<br/>
Celia&#160;finally&#160;realizes the&#160;cruel reality of the situation and&#160;<br/>that these&#160;women aren't going to let her inside.<br/>
She&#160;turns to leave. &#160;Dejected, she carries the pie back to&#160;<br/>the car.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME<br/>
Celia sits at the kitchen table halfway through the pie she&#160;<br/>tried to give to the bridge girls. &#160;<br/>
Minny&#160;fumes over a bowl of peas she's shelling.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=103></a>102.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Don't be taking those women any more&#160;<br/>pies, you understand?<br/>
Minny turns to reveal a deep cut and bruise above her eye.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
They made me stand there like I was&#160;<br/>the vacuum salesman. &#160;Why, Minny?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
'Cause they know about you getting&#160;<br/>knocked up by Mr. Johnny. &#160;Mad you&#160;<br/>married one a they mens. &#160;Especially&#160;<br/>since Miss Hilly and Mister Johnny&#160;<br/>had just broke up, too.&#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
So Hilly probably thinks I was&#160;<br/>fooling around with Johnny while&#160;<br/>they were still going steady.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Mm-hmmm. &#160;And Missus Walters always&#160;<br/>said Miss Hilly still sweet on&#160;<br/>Mister Johnny, too.&#160;<br/>
Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
No wonder! &#160;They don't hate me.&#160;They&#160;<br/>hate what they think I did!<br/>
MINNY<br/>
They hate you 'cause they think you&#160;<br/>white trash!&#160;<br/>
Minny's words bounce off of Celia's ears.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Well, I'm just going to have to let &#160;<br/>Hilly know I ain't no boyfriend&#160;<br/>stealer. &#160;In fact, I'll tell her&#160;<br/>Friday night at the benefit.<br/>
Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You don't need to be going to that&#160;<br/>benefit, Miss Celia.<br/>
Celia wets a wash cloth at the sink.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=104></a>103.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Did you hear me? &#160;Now you just stay&#160;<br/>home.<br/>
Celia approaches Minny. &#160;She looks at the cut over her eye.<br/>
CELIA&#160;<br/>
That looks bad. &#160;Let me take a look.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I got to get these peas on.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I know you didn't fall in no tub,&#160;<br/>Minny. &#160;<br/>
Minny starts to protest but is tired of excuses. &#160;She&#160;<br/>reluctantly sits down. &#160;Celia dabs at the wound.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
You know what I'd do if I were you?<br/>I'd give it right back to him. &#160;I'd&#160;<br/>hit him over the head with a skillet&#160;<br/>and I'd tell him to go straight to&#160;<br/>hell.<br/>
EXT. STREETS - DOWNTOWN JACKSON - DAY<br/>
It's eerily quiet, not a soul on the street.<br/>
<i>We hear archival footage of Walter&#160;Cronkite&#160;addressing the&#160;<br/>nation.&#160;</i>&#160;<i>Cronkite&#160;tells the nation that John F. Kennedy is&#160;<br/>dead.</i><br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME DAY<br/>
Skeeter and Stuart sit with the&#160;Phelan&#160;family watching&#160;<br/>Kennedy's&#160;funeral. &#160;Charlotte and Robert watch with little&#160;<br/>emotion. &#160;<br/>
Jameso&#160;and Pascagoula watch from the stairs.<br/>
Stuart checks the time and leans into Skeeter's ear.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Sweetheart, I've got to get down to&#160;<br/>the coast.<br/>
Skeeter nods as Stuart kisses her.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=105></a>104.<br/>
STUART<br/>
I'll be back in time for the&#160;<br/>benefit.&#160;<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE &#160;- KITCHEN - &#160;LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
A framed picture of&#160;JFK&#160;has now joined the pictures of&#160;<br/>Treelore&#160;and Jesus. &#160;<br/>
Minny, Skeeter and Aibileen sit quietly compiling stories. &#160;<br/>Aibileen grows anxious. &#160;<br/>
She suddenly jumps out of her chair and paces around the&#160;<br/>room.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
The world done gone crazy, Miss&#160;<br/>Skeeter! &#160;And I'm scared! &#160;What if&#160;<br/>people find out what we writing? &#160;<br/>Figure out&#160;&#34;Niceville&#34;&#160;really&#160;<br/>Jackson, and figure out who&#160;who?<br/>
Minny lets out a sigh. &#160;She knows it's time.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Maybe we need us some insurance. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter&#160;and Aibileen&#160;look to Minny.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I told God I'd never speak of it&#160;<br/>again, but we ain't got no choice.&#160;<br/>It's time to tell you both &#34;the&#160;<br/>terrible awful&#34; I did to Miss Hilly. &#160;<br/>It may be the only thing that keep&#160;<br/>us safe.<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DINING ROOM - 6 MONTHS&#160;<br/>EARLIER<br/>
We continue with the earlier flashback. &#160;Hilly is sitting at&#160;<br/>the table, finishing off her first slice of&#160;Minny's chocolate&#160;<br/>pie.&#160;<br/>
Minny stands silent as Hilly reaches for another slice.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
So. &#160;Nobody wanted to hire a&#160;sass-<br/>mouthin',&#160;thievin'&#160;nigra, did they?<br/>
Hilly&#160;licks her fingers. &#160;Minny can barely contain a smile as&#160;<br/>Hilly swallows another mouthful.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=106></a>105.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Pie's as good as always, Minny. &#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I'm glad you like it.<br/>
Missus Walters comes into the room and heads for the bar to&#160;<br/>prepare a drink.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
<i>If...</i>I&#160;take you back, I'll have to&#160;<br/>cut your pay five dollars a week.&#160;<br/>
Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly.&#160;<br/>
MINNY&#160;<br/>
Take me back?<br/>
HILLY<br/>
What&#160;do&#160;you&#160;put&#160;in&#160;here&#160;that makes&#160;<br/>it taste so good?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
That good vanilla from Mexico... &#160;<br/>
Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
And...something&#160;else real special.<br/>
Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
No, no&#160;no, Missus Walters. &#160;That&#160;<br/>Miss Hilly's special pie.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Momma can have a piece. &#160;<br/>
Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the table toward&#160;<br/>Minny. &#160;Minny stops it before it falls to the floor.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Cut her one! &#160;Go get a plate!<br/>
Minny fumes, quickly loosing control.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(suddenly)<br/>
Eat my&#160;shit.&#160;<br/>
Shock and silence fill the room. &#160;Missus Walters' mouth falls&#160;<br/>open.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=107></a>106.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
What did you say?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I said&#160;eat...&#160;my...&#160;shit!<br/>
Hilly slowly stands.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Have you lost your mind?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
No, Ma'am.<br/>
But you're about to,&#160;<br/>
'cause you just did.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Did what?<br/>
Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's pie with two&#160;<br/>slices missing.<br/>
Missus Walters&#160;looks to the pie and&#160;immediately gets it. &#160;She&#160;<br/>puts a hand&#160;over her mouth to contain her laughter.<br/>
Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in. &#160;She&#160;<br/>runs to the kitchen, gagging.<br/>
Missus Walters shouts after her.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
And you didn't just have one. &#160;You&#160;<br/>ate two slices!&#160;<br/>
The gravity of the situation sinks in for Minny. &#160;She grows&#160;<br/>uneasy and begins backing out of the dining room.<br/>
Missus Walters, drink in hand, sits down on a dining room&#160;<br/>chair&#160;laughing even louder now.<br/>
Minny runs out of the Holbrook house.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Run, Minny, run!<br/>
END FLASHBACK<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER&#160;<br/>
Aibileen and Skeeter are speechless.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You try' to get yourself killed?!<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=108></a>107.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
No! I wasn't&#160;plannin'&#160;on&#160;tellin'<br/>her, Aibileen! &#160;I just wanted to see&#160;<br/>her take a bite and then I was&#160;gonna<br/>leave. Be done with her forever.<br/>
Minny's eyes narrow.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Before I knew it, I had done told&#160;<br/>that woman what was in that pie.<br/>
Aibileen looks to Skeeter,&#160;shaking her head.&#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
I've done asked God to forgive me. &#160;<br/>But more for what happened to poor&#160;<br/>Missus Walters. &#160;Miss Hilly threw&#160;<br/>her in that nursing home just for&#160;<br/>laughing. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
(gravely)<br/>
We&#160;<i>can't&#160;</i>put that story in the book.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
We ain't got no choice! &#160;Hilly&#160;<br/>Holbrook can't let nobody know that&#160;<br/>pie story is about her.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Exactly! &#160;If people find out &#34;The&#160;<br/>Terrible Awful&#34; was you and Miss&#160;<br/>Hilly, we're in trouble there ain't&#160;<br/>words for!<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Right! &#160;But don't you see? &#160;She&#160;<br/>going to her grave convincing folks&#160;<br/>this book&#160;<i>ain't&#160;</i>about Jackson. &#160;Now&#160;<br/>that keeps us safe. &#160;Insured.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
No, no. &#160;That's too dangerous.<br/>
Minny stands up quickly.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
All&#160;right,&#160;y'all&#160;two brought me into&#160;<br/>this, but I'm&#160;gonna&#160;finish it! &#160;<br/>Either put it in or pull my parts&#160;<br/>out all together. &#160;Y'all&#160;pick!<br/>
Minny storms out of Aibileen's back door. &#160;<br/>

EXT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - &#160;NIGHT<br/>
The African Children's Benefit Ball is about to begin. &#160;A&#160;<br/>long line of&#160;Jacksonians&#160;pull cars up to a valet stand.&#160;<br/>
Missus Walters gets out of a cab, giving the DRIVER money.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Thank you, Tommy. &#160;I should be out&#160;<br/>by ten. &#160;See you then.<br/>
TOMMY<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Missus Walters&#160;merges with the elegant crowd walking toward&#160;<br/>the entrance. &#160;<br/>
Hilly stands at the top of the stairs. &#160;She wears swathes of&#160;<br/>green-colored taffeta. &#160;She stands next to Jolene French and&#160;<br/>a&#160;WLBT&#160;CAMERAMAN.&#160;<br/>
Jolene raises a microphone and looks into the camera.<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
This is Jolene French reporting from&#160;<br/>the African Children's Benefit Ball,&#160;<br/>and I'm here with League President,&#160;<br/>Miss Hilly Holbrook.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Thanks, Jolene. &#160;And I am so excited&#160;<br/>about the auction tonight, aren't&#160;<br/>you?&#160;<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
I'm absolutely thrilled.<br/>
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM<br/>
Three dozen servers stand in a line as if on display as the &#160;<br/>guests enter. &#160;Minny and Aibileen are among them.<br/>
Tables are covered with items donated for the auction. On the&#160;<br/>baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie promises to&#160;<br/>again be a big money maker.<br/>
Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a tight, &#160;<br/>sequined, sleeveless hot pink dress. &#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a>109.<br/>
Minny pokes Aibileen signaling her to look at Celia. &#160;<br/>Aibileen's eyes widen at the sight of Celia's dress and ample&#160;<br/>cleavage.<br/>
Celia&#160;sees a waitress with a tray of champagne glasses and&#160;<br/>nervously&#160;takes one. &#160;As Celia downs the glass of champagne,&#160;<br/>a group of female attendees&#160;looks at her with disgust.<br/>
Hilly sits at a table with Jolene and Elizabeth and their&#160;<br/>husbands. &#160;William waves at Celia, and watches her long after&#160;<br/>she has moved on. &#160;<br/>
Hilly reaches out and&#160;turns&#160;William's face away from Celia.<br/>
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - KITCHEN<br/>
Minny, Aibileen and Sugar enter the kitchen&#160;to&#160;prepare trays&#160;<br/>of hors&#160;d'oeuvres.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Lord have mercy. &#160;Women better hold&#160;<br/>onto they husbands tonight.<br/>
Minnie chuckles.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Miss&#160;Leefolt&#160;been working on that&#160;<br/>dress for four weeks and that's what&#160;<br/>she came up with?<br/>
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM<br/>
Charlotte and Robert slow dance; she looks beautiful despite&#160;<br/>her health.<br/>
Skeeter dances with Stuart. &#160;She wears a black velvet dress&#160;<br/>and her hair is being somewhat cooperative, thanks to the&#160;<br/>Shinolater. &#160;<br/>
STUART<br/>
Kiss me.<br/>
He and Skeeter kiss&#160;as other husbands and wives dance around&#160;<br/>them.&#160;<br/>
Celia looks at the baked goods in the silent auction. &#160;She&#160;<br/>writes a bid on Minny's pie.<br/>
She's a little drunk now.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=111></a>110.<br/>
The crowd has formed a circle around a tuxedo-clad Mr.&#160;<br/>Blackly, who dances energetically. &#160;He does a cartwheel.<br/>
MR. BLACKLY<br/>
Ho! &#160;Who-hoo!<br/>
The crowd cheers.<br/>
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LADIES LOUNGE - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Elizabeth,&#160;Jolene&#160;and Mary Beth&#160;apply make up and chat it up&#160;<br/>in the ladies lounge. &#160;They notice Celia entering, cocktail&#160;<br/>in hand.&#160;<br/>
Celia&#160;staggers slightly, intoxicated, leans against a wall&#160;<br/>and applies her lipstick. &#160;Jolene scoffs.<br/>
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM<br/>
Just as the band concludes its song, Hilly makes her way to&#160;<br/>the podium.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Everybody enjoying the evening?<br/>
The room claps enthusiastically. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
(flatly)<br/>
Let's give a nice round of applause&#160;<br/>for the help. &#160;For all the men and&#160;<br/>women that have helped make tonight&#160;<br/>possible.<br/>
Hilly mechanically gestures toward the uniformed servers in&#160;<br/>the room.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
A cause I'm sure is dear to their&#160;<br/>hearts,&#160;as well.<br/>
Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies&#160;<br/>down.&#160;<br/>
A waiter brings Celia another drink.<br/>
WAITER<br/>
Your cocktail.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=112></a>111.<br/>
The waiter moves off.<br/>
Johnny turns to his wife.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Honey, don't you think you've had&#160;<br/>enough to drink? I wish you'd try&#160;<br/>and eat something.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I'm not&#160;havin'&#160;my stomach poke out!<br/>
She leans over and kisses him.<br/>
INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Jolene rushes up to the stage and takes the microphone.<br/>
JOLENE&#160;<br/>
Okay everybody, quiet down. I've got&#160;<br/>the list of winners! &#160;Okay, the&#160;<br/>winner of the beautiful mink car-<br/>coat&#160;is...Charlotte&#160;Phelan!<br/>
Charlotte beams. &#160;She slaps Robert playfully,&#160;knowing he bid&#160;<br/>on the coat for her. Skeeter reaches over and touches her&#160;<br/>mom's arm. &#160;<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
Congrats,&#160;Miss&#160;Phelan. &#160;Ladies, I&#160;<br/>hope your husbands take note of&#160;<br/>that.<br/>
The rooms laughs.&#160;<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
Now, it's time for the baked goods.&#160;<br/>
Jolene flips a page.<br/>
JOLENE<br/>
Oh, yummy, yummy! The highest bid in&#160;<br/>baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's&#160;<br/>chocolate pie. Congratulations,&#160;<br/>Hilly Holbrook!<br/>
Minny's eyes go wide. &#160;The room erupts in applause. &#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS&#160;<br/>
Oh! Hilly!<br/>
HILLY<br/>
That's funny. &#160;I didn't bid on&#160;<br/>anything.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=113></a>112.<br/>
Jolene continues announcing the winners.<br/>
Celia beams with pride and rushes up behind Hilly, hugging&#160;<br/>her at the neck, startling her.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Yay! Congratulations, Hilly! &#160;I&#160;<br/>didn't know you were a fan of&#160;<br/>Minny's pies.<br/>
Hilly remains calm. &#160;Celia sits down beside her.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I've been wanting to talk to you all&#160;<br/>night. &#160;Minny said why you won't be&#160;<br/>my friend. &#160;It's 'cause you think me&#160;<br/>and Johnny went behind your back.<br/>
Hilly stands up to leave. &#160;Celia reaches out to stop her and&#160;<br/>tears the sleeves on Hilly's dress. &#160;Hilly gasps.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I'm so sorry!<br/>
Hilly stands dumbstruck for a moment, her mouth agape. &#160;She&#160;<br/>composes herself and steps closer to Celia.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Come here, sweetheart, let me bring&#160;<br/>you back to your table.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Okay. &#160;I'm really sorry.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
It's all right. &#160;Don't worry about&#160;<br/>it.<br/>
Hilly begins to lead her away; then she suddenly stops and&#160;<br/>spins Celia around to face her.<br/>
HILLY&#160;<br/>
What are you trying to do to me? &#160;<br/>What are you and that nigra up to?&#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I don't know what you're&#160;talkin'<br/>about.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You liar! &#160;Who did you tell?!<br/>
People nearby grow quiet.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=114></a>113.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Hilly, I got pregnant&#160;<i>after&#160;</i>you and&#160;<br/>Johnny broke up!<br/>
Missus Walters&#160;perks up.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
(laughing)<br/>
Oh,&#160;shit!<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Shut up,&#160;Mother!<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Johnny never cheated on you...&#160;At&#160;<br/>least, not with me.<br/>
Celia starts to breathe heavily. &#160;Her eyes start to water.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Oh! Johnny would never cheat on me.<br/>
Johnny hears this and gets up quickly.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I'm so sorry! &#160;I thought you'd be&#160;<br/>tickled you won that pie.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You tell that nigra if she tells&#160;<br/>anybody, I will make her suffer!<br/>
Johnny walks up&#160;to Hilly.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Hey, that is enough. &#160;Celia?<br/>
CELIA&#160;<br/>
Uh-oh.<br/>
Feeling sick,&#160;Celia puts her hand over her mouth and&#160;runs for&#160;<br/>the bathroom. &#160;She stumbles behind Hilly's table. &#160;She leans&#160;<br/>behind Missus Walters'&#160;chair and vomits on the floor. &#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Oh,&#160;shit.<br/>
Celia retches behind her.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
What a mess. &#160;Napkins.<br/>
Elizabeth holds her hand over her mouth and holds out her&#160;<br/>napkin out for Missus Walters, as does Raleigh.<br/>

EXT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - STAIRS - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Hilly and William&#160;say goodbye to guests as they amble to&#160;<br/>their cars. &#160;<br/>
Missus Walters&#160;emerges from the hotel&#160;holding Minny's pie.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Just come on home with us tonight,&#160;<br/>Mother.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
No thanks, I got a pie to eat.<br/>
Hilly spins around and sees the pie.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You throw that pie away right now!<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
I spent good money on this pie. &#160;I &#160;<br/>won it just for you.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You signed me up?<br/>
Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
I may have trouble remembering my&#160;<br/>own name or what country I live in. &#160;<br/>But there's two things I can't seem&#160;<br/>to forget: &#160;That my own daughter&#160;<br/>threw me into a nursing&#160;home...and<br/>that she ate Minny's&#160;shit. &#160;Good&#160;<br/>night.<br/>
Missus Walters stops to speak to a MALE BANQUET ATTENDEE.&#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Hey, how about a nightcap?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=116></a>115.<br/>
MALE BANQUET ATTENDEE<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
The man escorts Missus Walters to the valet stand.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Minny stands in the doorway&#160;of Celia's bedroom.&#160;Distraught,&#160;<br/>Celia is packing a suitcase.<br/>
CELIA&#160;<br/>
I'm not right for this kind of life,&#160;<br/>Minny. &#160;I don't need a dining room&#160;<br/>table for twelve people. I couldn't&#160;<br/>get&#160;<i>two&#160;</i>people over here if I&#160;<br/>begged. &#160;I can't do this to Johnny&#160;<br/>anymore. &#160;That's why I gotta go back&#160;<br/>to Sugar Ditch.<br/>
Celia&#160;starts to cry.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch,&#160;<br/>Miss Celia.<br/>
Minny leads Celia to a bench at the foot of the bed.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.&#160;<br/>
Minny lowers Celia to the bench.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Sit down.<br/>
Minny crosses to the bedroom door and closes it.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Celia sits wide-eyed,&#160;but calm, on the bench beside Minny.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
So Miss Hilly thought you knew 'bout&#160;<br/>&#34;The Terrible Awful&#34;--that you were&#160;<br/>making fun of her. &#160;It's my fault&#160;<br/>she pounced on you. &#160;If you leave&#160;<br/>Mister Johnny, then Miss Hilly done&#160;<br/>won the whole ball game. &#160;Then she&#160;<br/>done beaten me, and she done beat&#160;<br/>you...&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=117></a>116.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Thank you for telling me that.<br/>
Celia turns her head toward Minny, not sure of what to make&#160;<br/>of this unique revelation.<br/>
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING<br/>
The&#160;finished&#160;manuscript sits&#160;on the kitchen table&#160;before&#160;<br/>Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.<br/>
Aibileen reaches down and drags&#160;<br/>
her fingers across the stack of paper.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Lord, look at all these pages. &#160;Two-<br/>hundred and sixty-six of 'em.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Mm. So we just send it off? &#160;Just&#160;<br/>wait and see? &#160;Hope Miss Stein&#160;gonna<br/>publish it?<br/>
Skeeter nods as she looks solemnly at the manuscript.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Well, I have one more story to type&#160;<br/>before I put it in the mail. &#160;But&#160;<br/>other than that, we're done.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Which one you got left?<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Uh, mine.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - BEDROOM - DAY<br/>
Skeeter enters Charlotte's room.&#160;<br/>
Charlotte is sitting up in bed working a needle point pattern&#160;<br/>with her hands. &#160;She's wig free and terribly thin. &#160;<br/>
Her collarbone protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as&#160;<br/>sharp as ever.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I need to talk to you about&#160;<br/>Constantine.<br/>
Charlotte looks up to Skeeter for a moment.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Oh, Eugenia. &#160;That was so long ago.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=118></a>117.<br/>
Charlotte resumes her sewing. &#160;Skeeter sits next to her and&#160;<br/>takes the needle point out of her hands.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What happened?!<br/>
Charlotte looks down,&#160;knowing she's trapped.&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
She didn't give me a choice!<br/>The Daughters of America had just&#160;<br/>appointed me state regent...<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM - DAY<br/>
Charlotte, much healthier, stands in her living room&#160;<br/>surrounded by DAR members.<br/>
GRACE&#160;HIGGINBOTHAM, 65, regal, attaches a blue ribbon with a&#160;<br/>medallion to Charlotte's lapel.<br/>
CHARLOTTE (V.O.)<br/>
Grace&#160;Higginbotham, our esteemed&#160;<br/>president, had come all the way&#160;<br/>down from Washington,&#160;D.C.&#160;to&#160;our<br/>house&#160;for the ceremony.<br/>
Grace hugs Charlotte as all the women applaud.&#160;A photographer&#160;<br/>snaps a picture of the moment.<br/>
Constantine lingers in a corner watching proudly.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
(re: ribbon)<br/>
Oh,&#160;it's beautiful! &#160;Just look at&#160;<br/>that!<br/>
Charlotte catches eyes with Constantine and winks. &#160;They&#160;<br/>smile at each other for a moment before Charlotte is sucked&#160;<br/>back into the ceremony.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME (FLASHBACK) - DINING ROOM - DAY<br/>
Charlotte sits with Grace and six other women at the dining&#160;<br/>table as Constantine begins serving lunch&#160;<i>very slowl</i>y and&#160;<br/>awkwardly from a bowl. &#160;Charlotte looks embarrassed.<br/>
CHARLOTTE (V.O.)<br/>
She'd gotten so old and slow,&#160;<br/>Skeeter.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=119></a>118.<br/>
Charlotte hears knocking at&#160;a&#160;door&#160;leading into the dining&#160;<br/>room from the porch. &#160;She goes to answer it. &#160;<br/>
She opens it to find&#160;Constantine's daughter&#160;RACHEL, 35,&#160;<br/>standing on the other side of the screened door.<br/>
CHARLOTTE (V.O.)<br/>
Now, Constantine had told me Rachel&#160;<br/>would be coming for a visit.<br/>
RACHEL<br/>
Hello, Miss Charlotte.<br/>
Rachel is groomed and well dressed. Charlotte forms a tight&#160;<br/>smile. &#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Rachel. &#160;We were expecting you next&#160;<br/>week.<br/>
RACHEL<br/>
I decided to come early and surprise&#160;<br/>Momma.<br/>
Rachel starts to open the screen door to enter. &#160;Charlotte&#160;<br/>pulls&#160;it shut.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
I'm entertaining. &#160;Why don't you go&#160;<br/>around back and wait in the kitchen.&#160;<br/>
The DAR women's body language conveys their shock at a black&#160;<br/>woman bold enough to&#160;enter uninvited.<br/>
Constantine&#160;grows&#160;<br/>
worried.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Go on now!<br/>
Charlotte closes the door on the stunned Rachel and goes back&#160;<br/>to her seat.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
(to the ladies)<br/>
I am sorry.<br/>
Rachel&#160;opens the door and&#160;walks into the dining room.&#160;&#160;All&#160;<br/>eyes are on her.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Rachel, what are you doing?<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=120></a>119.<br/>
RACHEL<br/>
I'm just doing as I was told, Miss&#160;<br/>Charlotte.&#160;Goin'&#160;to the kitchen. &#160;<br/>But I'm&#160;gonna&#160;see&#160;Momma first.<br/>
Rachel walks up to Constantine.<br/>
RACHEL<br/>
Hello, Momma.<br/>
Constantine tries to walk Rachel to the kitchen.<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
Go on to the kitchen, baby. I'll be&#160;<br/>there directly. &#160;Go on, go, go. &#160;Go,&#160;<br/>go.<br/>
Grace stands and turns to Charlotte.<br/>
GRACE<br/>
You may put up with this kind of&#160;<br/>nonsense,&#160;but I do not.<br/>
Charlotte is forced to make an unpleasant call.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Get out of this house, Rachel.<br/>
GRACE<br/>
You heard her. &#160;Go on,&#160;girl.<br/>
Constantine grabs Rachel's hand.<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
Miss Charlotte, let me just take her&#160;<br/>to the kitchen.<br/>
Constantine pulls Rachel toward the kitchen.<br/>
CONSTANTINE<br/>
Come on, baby, let's go.<br/>
Grace turns to Charlotte with judgment.<br/>
GRACE<br/>
Charlotte?<br/>
Charlotte moves to the other side of the dining room,<br/>blocking the path to the front door.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Both of you. &#160;Leave now.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=121></a>120.<br/>
Charlotte points to the back door. &#160;Constantine stares at&#160;<br/>Charlotte for a moment. &#160;<br/>
RACHEL<br/>
Come on,&#160;Momma.<br/>
Rachel leads her sad, frail mother out the door.<br/>
The screen&#160;<br/>
door slams shut behind them.<br/>
Constantine turns and, placing her hand on the screen door, &#160;<br/>looks at Charlotte for a final time.<br/>
RACHEL<br/>
Come on&#160;now, Momma.<br/>
Charlotte looks torn as she walks to the door and closes it&#160;<br/>on them.<br/>
END FLASHBACK<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter trembles. &#160;Charlotte won't look at her.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Constantine didn't do anything&#160;<br/>wrong. And you love Rachel. &#160;I know&#160;<br/>you do. &#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
She was our president, Eugenia. &#160; &#160;<br/>What was I supposed to do?&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
She did you the biggest favor of&#160;<br/>your life. &#160;She taught me&#160;<br/>everything.<br/>
Charlotte gets defensive.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Well, you idolized her too much! You&#160;<br/>always have!<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I needed someone to look up to.<br/>
This stings Charlotte to the core.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
I went to her house the next day,&#160;<br/>but she'd already gone.&#160;<br/>

INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - BEDROOM - DAY&#160;<br/>
Constantine packs a suitcase on her bed. &#160;She walks to a door&#160;<br/>frame, her shaky hand moving her fingers up over various&#160;<br/>height markers penciled into the wall. &#160;Markers, through the&#160;<br/>years, for both Rachel and Skeeter.<br/>
END FLASHBACK<br/>
PHELAN&#160;HOME - BEDROOM - DAY<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
How could you not tell me all this?<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Because I didn't want you upset&#160;<br/>during your final exams. &#160;And, and,&#160;<br/>I knew you'd blame me and it wasn't&#160;<br/>my fault.<br/>
Skeeter rises.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I have to go find her. &#160;She needs&#160;<br/>me.<br/>
Skeeter walks toward the door.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Eugenia.<br/>
Skeeter stops and turns. &#160;Charlotte stares,&#160;unable to get the&#160;<br/>words out.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What?!<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Honey, we sent your brother up to&#160;<br/>Chicago to bring Constantine home.<br/>
Skeeter nods and walks back to her mother.<br/>
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)<br/>
When he got&#160;there...she&#160;had died... &#160;<br/>
Skeeter shakes her head and cries. &#160;Charlotte covers her&#160;<br/>mouth with her hand.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You broke her heart.<br/>
Skeeter starts to exit. Charlotte lowers her hand from her&#160;<br/>mouth.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=123></a>122.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
(breaking down)<br/>
I'm sorry. &#160;I'm so sorry. &#160;I'm&#160;<br/>sorry...<br/>
EXT. DIRT ROAD BY CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
Skeeter drives the&#160;Cadillac&#160;around a bend and&#160;pulls into the&#160;<br/>yard of Constantine's house, an old shack with a rusted-out&#160;<br/>tin roof.&#160;<br/>
She puts the lever in park and stares off&#160;to Constantine's&#160;<br/>porch steps.<br/>
EXT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY<br/>
A bottle tree is glistening in the afternoon sun. It casts a&#160;<br/>kaleidoscope of colors across the side of the house.<br/>
A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, 6, who is young Skeeter, sits in the&#160;<br/>lap of a younger Constantine who wears a white work dress.&#160;<br/>
Constantine is putting young Skeeter's unruly hair into&#160;<br/>braids. Young Skeeter looks up and smiles.<br/>

Skeeter smiles&#160;at Constantine's abandoned house.&#160;<br/>
EXT. BOOKSTORE - DOWNTOWN JACKSON - SIX MONTHS LATER<br/>
The display window of a bookstore. &#160;A clerk sets down a stack&#160;<br/>of light blue books beside&#160;an identical&#160;stack.<br/>
She then takes one and sets it vertically atop the stack for&#160;<br/>display: &#160;<i>The Help</i>, by Anonymous.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
They printed a few thousand copies&#160;<br/>with the worst advance Miss Stein&#160;<br/>had ever seen. &#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=124></a>123.<br/>
Minny snatches the mail from Sugar and sees an envelope from&#160;<br/>Skeeter.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(to Benny)<br/>
What you&#160;doin'&#160;with&#160;Kindra's&#160;book?&#160;<br/>You can't read.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
They sent Miss Skeeter six hundred&#160;<br/>dollars. She broke the money up and&#160;<br/>gave it to each of us.&#160;<br/>
Minny tears it open to find cash inside and a note from&#160;<br/>Skeeter saying &#34;More to come.&#34; &#160;Minny's eyes go wide.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Divided thirteen ways that came to&#160;<br/>bout forty-six dollars each. &#160;<br/>
Minny quickly closes the letter, stuffs it in her bra as she&#160;<br/>runs for the door.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(to the kids)<br/>
Y'all&#160;finish your homework.<br/>
Minny runs out the screen door as the chicken begins to burn.<br/>

MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
&#34;She fired me for using the inside&#160;<br/>toilet. &#160;Put me out in a storm and&#160;<br/>told me never to come back. &#160;But I&#160;<br/>did come back.&#160;<br/>

MISSUS WALTERS (CONT'D)<br/>
I came back with a pie I had baked&#160;<br/>to say I'm sorry. I watched her&#160;<br/>eat...&#34;<br/>
She turns a page and suddenly freezes. &#160;&#160;Reading to herself&#160;<br/>now, a satisfied smile begins to form.<br/>
INT. NURSING HOME - MISSUS WALTERS' ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Missus Walters sits on the bed and talks on the phone with&#160;<br/>Hilly as she inspects her fingernails with a magnifying&#160;<br/>glass. &#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly. &#160;&#160;<br/>Filled with&#160;grippin'&#160;testimonials&#160;<br/>from Mississippi's housekeepers.<br/>

HILLY<br/>
Okay, Momma! &#160;I need to run. &#160;<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
You should read the book, Hilly. &#160;<br/>It's quite scandalous.&#160;It sounds&#160;<br/>like Jackson,&#160;if you ask me.&#160;<br/>
Hilly's sudden silence fills Missus Walters with delight.<br/>
MISSUS WALTERS<br/>
Quite scandalous.<br/>
HILLY<br/>

Minny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in&#160;<br/>the grocery store. &#160;The white shoppers are dressed casually. &#160;<br/>Other maids in the store keep quietly to themselves.&#160;<br/>
White women smile and chat with one another as they meander&#160;<br/>down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=126></a>125.<br/>
As Aibileen reaches the end of an aisle, she suddenly&#160;<br/>freezes.<br/>
An older white woman stands by the butcher counter. &#160;Her face&#160;<br/>is pressed into a copy of&#160;<i>The Help</i>. &#160;Minny now reaches the&#160;<br/>end of the aisle and sees this, too.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>

The older woman is completely engrossed in the book.<br/>

Skeeter follows Stuart around the corner of the house.&#160;Fuming&#160;<br/>mad, he's just arrived from the rig, still wearing his work&#160;<br/>clothes.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You told me to write something good. &#160;<br/>Something I believed in.<br/>
STUART<br/>
Well, it's not what I believe in!&#160;&#160;<br/>
Skeeter grabs Stuart's arm. &#160;He pulls away.&#160;<br/>
STUART<br/>
That joke you pulled on Hilly with&#160;<br/>the toilets, that's funny. &#160;But why&#160;<br/>would you do this to us? &#160;I don't&#160;<br/>even know why you care.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What?<br/>
STUART<br/>
Things are fine around here. &#160;Why go&#160;<br/>stir up trouble?!<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Trouble's already here, Stuart. I&#160;<br/>had to tell you this. You needed to&#160;<br/>know.<br/>
STUART<br/>
You're&#160;goddamn&#160;right I needed to&#160;<br/>know!<br/>
You should have told me this&#160;<br/>
from the start. &#160;You're a selfish&#160;<br/>woman, Skeeter.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Stuart!<br/>

The room suddenly erupts in laughter. &#160;<br/>
INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT<br/>
Hilly reads the book in bed. &#160;William is fast asleep.<br/>

A horrible fever blister&#160;<br/>

JOLENE FRENCH<br/>
I heard that Betty character might&#160;<br/>be Mary Elizabeth.<br/>
A nervous Aibileen pours tea.<br/>

It's not Jackson, and that book is&#160;<br/>garbage. &#160;I bet the whole thing's&#160;<br/>made up by some nigra.<br/>
Hilly raises her eyes to Aibileen.<br/>
MARY BETH CALDWELL<br/>

She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out&#160;<br/>to&#160;<i>TWO-SLICE HILLY!</i><br/>
Hilly's&#160;eyes narrow as she rips the check into pieces.<br/>

A furious Hilly drinks a beer while driving; her station&#160;<br/>wagon flies down the country road leading to the&#160;Phelan&#160;farm. &#160;<br/>
Hilly makes a left turn too fast. &#160;She loses control and&#160;<br/>fishtails momentarily. &#160;She speeds on, tossing the empty beer&#160;<br/>bottle and puffing on a cigarette.<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME -&#160;MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Skeeter sits on the porch reading a Harper and Row job offer&#160;<br/>for the hundredth time.&#160;<br/>
Behind her, a huge plume of dust trails Hilly's car, which&#160;<br/>speeds along a distant road.<br/>
EXT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Tires&#160;crunch&#160;gravel down the drive. &#160;Skeeter sees a car&#160;<br/>moving toward her and soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.<br/>
Hilly gets out of her car smoking a cigarette and storms&#160;<br/>toward the front door. &#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What the hell..?<br/>
Hilly stops and turns toward the approaching Skeeter.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
What are you doing here?<br/>
Hilly throws her cigarette at Skeeter.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I've contacted my lawyer,&#160;Hibbie<br/>Goodman. &#160;<br/>
(MORE)<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=130></a>129.<br/>
HILLY (CONT'D)<br/>
He's the best libel attorney in the&#160;<br/>state. Oh Missy, you're going to&#160;<br/>jail!<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You can't prove anything.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Oh,&#160;I one-hundred-percent know you&#160;<br/>wrote it 'cause nobody else in town&#160;<br/>is as tacky as you.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
You don't know anything, Hilly.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I don't, do I? &#160;You tell Aibileen,&#160;<br/>the next time she wants to write&#160;<br/>about my dear friend&#160;Elizabeth...uh-<br/>huh. &#160;Remember her? &#160;Had you in her&#160;<br/>wedding? &#160;Let's just say, Aibileen&#160;<br/>ought&#160;to've&#160;been a little bit&#160;<br/>smarter before&#160;puttin'&#160;in about that&#160;<br/>L-shaped&#160;scratch in poor Elizabeth's&#160;<br/>dining table. &#160;And that&#160;nigger,&#160;<br/>Minny? &#160;Do I have plans for her.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Careful, Hilly. &#160;Now that's chapter&#160;<br/>twelve. &#160;Don't give yourself away&#160;<br/>now.&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
That was not me!<br/>
Hilly storms up the porch steps. &#160;Skeeter follows.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
I've come to tell your mother what a&#160;<br/>hippie you've become. &#160;She's&#160;gonna<br/>be disgusted by you.<br/>
Charlotte suddenly appears at the door and steps out onto the&#160;<br/>porch. &#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Why, Hilly. Everything okay, you&#160;<br/>two?<br/>
Although frail, Charlotte looks beautiful. &#160;Well made up,&#160;<br/>wearing an elegant turban.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Oh, Missus&#160;Phelan,&#160;I'm...I'm&#160;here to-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=131></a>130.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess. &#160;Are&#160;<br/>you ill?&#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
No, ma'am.<br/>
Charlotte points to Hilly's fever blister.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Darling, no husband wants to come&#160;<br/>home and see that. &#160;<br/>
Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Well,&#160;I...I&#160;didn't have time to get&#160;<br/>fixed up--<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
You know, Hilly. &#160;If I didn't know&#160;<br/>any better, I'd say you've been&#160;<br/>eating too much pie.<br/>
Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Missus&#160;Phelan, I came here--<br/>
Charlotte moves in for the kill.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
In fact,&#160;I'm sure of it. &#160;Now go on! &#160;<br/>Get your raggedy ass off my porch. &#160;<br/>Go on. Get off my property. &#160;Now!&#160;<br/>Before we all get one of those&#160;<br/>disgustin'&#160;things on our lips.&#160;<br/>
As Hilly backs away from the house, she looks back and forth&#160;<br/>between Skeeter &amp; Charlotte. &#160;She climbs back into her car.&#160;<br/>
Hilly's tires spray gravel as she speeds away.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Eugenia.<br/>
She reaches for Skeeter's hand.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Take me inside, please.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Yes, ma'am.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=132></a>131.<br/>
She leads her mother inside.<br/>
INT.&#160;PHELAN&#160;HOME - RECEIVING ROOM<br/>
Skeeter and Charlotte&#160;cross the living room together.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
No, Ma'am.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Good. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter leads her mother to a sofa, helps her sit.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Because we are going shopping.<br/>No single daughter of mine is going&#160;<br/>to New York City, representing the&#160;<br/>great state of Mississippi, without&#160;<br/>a proper&#160;<i>cosmopolitan&#160;</i>wardrobe.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
How do you know about New York?<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last&#160;<br/>night. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter looks away nervously.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Courage sometimes skips a&#160;<br/>generation.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter turns back to her mother.<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
Thank you for bringing it back to&#160;<br/>our family.<br/>
Skeeter nods, relieved. &#160;But also concerned.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I can't leave you like this.<br/>
CHARLOTTE&#160;<br/>
Eugenia, I've made a decision. Now&#160;<br/>my health's been on the uptick these&#160;<br/>past few weeks. &#160;<br/>
(MORE)<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=133></a>132.<br/>
CHARLOTTE &#160;(CONT'D)<br/>
And I know the doctor says it's some&#160;<br/>kind of last strength nonsense. &#160;But-<br/>-I&#160;have decided not to die.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh, Momma. &#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
It's too late. &#160;I tried calling&#160;<br/>Fanny Mae's so I could make your&#160;<br/>hair appointments for the next&#160;<br/>twenty years, but they wouldn't&#160;<br/>allow it. &#160;<br/>
Skeeter laughs.&#160;<br/>
CHARLOTTE<br/>
I have never been more proud of you.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Thank you.&#160;<br/>
Charlotte leans over and kisses her daughter on the forehead.<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
Oh,&#160;Momma.<br/>
They hug.<br/>
EXT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - SIDE WALK - DAY<br/>
Minny walks up the long front walk of the&#160;Foote&#160;Estate,<br/>holding a bag of groceries in one arm, a fan in the other&#160;<br/>hand,&#160;and&#160;her purse slung over her arm at the elbow.<br/>
Minny slows as she hears a car approaching behind her. &#160;She&#160;<br/>turns to see Johnny&#160;Foote&#160;behind the wheel of his car.<br/>
Minny freezes as Johnny stops his car.&#160;<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Need some help with those?<br/>
Johnny&#160;gets out of the car. &#160;His approach is a little too&#160;<br/>quick for Minny's&#160;comfort. She takes off toward the house&#160;<br/>with her best gallop. &#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Miss Celia!<br/>
Johnny chases after her.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=134></a>133.<br/>
JOHNNY (CONT'D)<br/>
Minny, hey, stop!<br/>
Minny drops the groceries, the purse and the fan.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Miss Celia!<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Minny!<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Stay back! &#160;Stay back!<br/>
Minny&#160;picks up a&#160;fallen&#160;branch&#160;from the ground and rears it&#160;<br/>back like&#160;a weapon.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Hey, I'm not here to hurt you,&#160;girl!<br/>You wanna put the stick down?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(shaking her head no)<br/>
Um-um.<br/>
Minny breathes&#160;heavily.<br/>
JOHNNY&#160;<br/>
Listen, Celia finally told me about&#160;<br/>the babies. &#160;All of 'em. But I also&#160;<br/>know that the minute you started&#160;<br/>working here, she started getting&#160;<br/>better. &#160;So you saved her life.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You...knew&#160;I was here the whole&#160;<br/>time?<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Fried chicken and okra on the first&#160;<br/>night? &#160;Y'all&#160;should have at least&#160;<br/>put corn pone on the table.&#160;<br/>
Minny tosses the stick down, shakes her head.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
No... I couldn't let you eat no more&#160;<br/>corn pone, Mister Johnny.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Well, thanks to you, now I've had to&#160;<br/>let out every pair of pants I own.<br/>
Minny starts to collect the groceries.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=135></a>134.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Oh, no. &#160;You just leave that.<br/>
Johnny&#160;picks up Minny's purse, bag and fan.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Here you go. &#160;Let's head on up to&#160;<br/>the house.<br/>
Johnny&#160;escorts&#160;Minny&#160;across the lawn&#160;toward the house.<br/>
INT.&#160;FOOTE&#160;ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Johnny leads&#160;Minny into the dining room. The table, set&#160;<br/>beautifully in silver and crystal, is covered with delicious-<br/>looking casseroles, baked goods and fried chicken.<br/>
Celia steps forward proudly.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
What's all this?<br/>
CELIA&#160;<br/>
I cooked it all by myself.<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
Yes, she did. &#160;She was up all night.<br/>
CELIA<br/>
I wanted to do something special. I&#160;<br/>wanted to say &#34;thank you.&#34; &#160;<br/>
Completely surprised and moved, Minny becomes emotional.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
So...I&#160;ain't losing my job?<br/>
JOHNNY<br/>
No, you've got a job with us for the&#160;<br/>rest of your life, if you want it. &#160;<br/>
MINNY<br/>
(eyeing a pie)<br/>
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss&#160;<br/>Celia.<br/>
Johnny pulls out a chair for her. &#160;Minny sits as Celia&#160;<br/>prepares a plate of food.<br/>
Celia stabs a piece of fried chicken and puts it on Minny's&#160;<br/>plate.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=136></a>135.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Thank you. &#160;Ooh! &#160;You remember to&#160;<br/>check the thighs?&#160;<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Mm-hmm. &#160;Cooked clean through.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Ain't pink in the middle?<br/>
CELIA<br/>
Mm-mm. &#160;Just the way you taught me.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
Look&#160;a&#160;here...<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
That table of food gave Minny the&#160;<br/>strength she needed. &#160;She took her&#160;<br/>babies out from under Leroy and&#160;<br/>never went back.<br/>
EXT. MOUNT ZION CHURCH - DAY<br/>
Aibileen and Minny walk toward the church through the &#160;<br/>parking lot.&#160;Cars are stacked up in all directions.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
What are all these cars doing out&#160;<br/>here? &#160;We late?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
No, we ain't late.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Why ain't you&#160;singin'?<br/>
MINNY<br/>
We got to worry about getting in&#160;<br/>there and get our seats. &#160;Come on&#160;<br/>now, we late!<br/>
INT. MOUNT ZION BAPTIST CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
As Minny and Aibileen enter the church, two&#160;hundred members&#160;<br/>stand at once. &#160;The congregation begins to clap.<br/>
Minny&#160;begins to clap with a knowing smile.&#160;<br/>
Aibileen looks&#160;around,&#160;trying to figure out the&#160;object&#160;of&#160;<br/>adulation. &#160;She&#160;starts&#160;clapping,&#160;too.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=137></a>136.<br/>
Aibileen steps up to a woman in the last pew.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Who we&#160;clappin'&#160;for?<br/>
The woman laughs.<br/>
PEARLY/CHURCH WOMAN&#160;<br/>
Honey, we&#160;clappin'&#160;for you.<br/>
Aibileen looks to Minny, realizing she's in on it.<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
Come on down, Sister Clark! &#160;Come&#160;<br/>on!<br/>
Aibileen begins to walk down the center aisle. &#160;Preacher&#160;<br/>Green extends his hand toward her. &#160;She joins him on the&#160;<br/>pulpit.<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
All right. &#160;All right. &#160;Now, this is&#160;<br/>an important time in our community. &#160; &#160;<br/>And we have to thank you for what&#160;<br/>you have done.&#160;<br/>
He lifts a book off of the&#160;lectern.<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
Now, we know you couldn't put your&#160;<br/>name in here, so we all signed our&#160;<br/>own. &#160;<br/>
He gives the book to Aibileen.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Thank you. &#160;<br/>
She hesitates.<br/>
PREACHER GREEN<br/>
Come on now, come on.&#160;<br/>
The entire congregation, all holding copies of the book,&#160;<br/>applaud and &#34;amen&#34;. &#160;Minny beams. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen extends a hand toward Minny, who joins her on the&#160;<br/>pulpit. &#160;Aibileen puts her arm around her shoulder.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=138></a>137.<br/>
EXT. PREACHER GREEN'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
Skeeter thumbs through her signed book. Hundreds of&#160;<br/>signatures cover the pages. &#160;She stands with Aibileen and&#160;<br/>Minny outside Preacher Green's house. &#160;<br/>
The preacher can be seen in the background, sitting on his&#160;<br/>porch. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Churches over two counties signed&#160;<br/>our books. &#160;All for you and me.&#160;<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
It's beautiful.<br/>
Skeeter closes the book regretfully.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
What's wrong?<br/>
SKEETER&#160;<br/>
I got a job offer from Harper and&#160;<br/>Row...in&#160;New York. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Congratulations!<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I'm not taking it.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
What you mean,&#160;you not takin' it?&#160;<br/>
SKEETER<br/>
I can't just leave you two here when&#160;<br/>things are getting bad from a mess I&#160;<br/>created.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
If bad things happen, they ain't&#160;<br/>nothing you can do about it. &#160;And&#160;<br/>now it's for a reason we can be&#160;<br/>proud of.<br/>
Skeeter nods with little relief.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I don't mean to rub salt in your&#160;<br/>wound,&#160;but...you&#160;ain't got a good&#160;<br/>life here in Jackson. &#160;Plus, your&#160;<br/>momma's getting better-<br/>
Minny chimes in.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=139></a>138.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
You ain't got nothing left here but&#160;<br/>enemies in the Junior League. &#160;You&#160;<br/>done burned ever bridge there is. &#160;<br/>And you ain't never gone get another&#160;<br/>man in this town, and everybody know&#160;<br/>it. &#160;So don't walk your white butt&#160;<br/>to New York, RUN IT!<br/>
Minny places her hand on Aibileen's shoulder.<br/>
MINNY<br/>
And look&#160;a&#160;here, Miss Skeeter. &#160;I'm&#160;<br/>gone take care a Aibileen, and she&#160;<br/>gone take care a me.&#160;<br/>
Skeeter nods. &#160;Aibileen extends her hand to Skeeter, who&#160;<br/>takes it.<br/>
Aibileen presses her thumb into Skeeter's palm.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN &#160;- LATER THAT MORNING<br/>
Aibileen enters with two bags of groceries. &#160;Elizabeth calls&#160;<br/>out from the den.<br/>
ELIZABETH (O.C.)<br/>
Aibileen, can you come here,&#160;please?<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Aibileen enters to find Elizabeth and Hilly staring at her. &#160;<br/>Elizabeth holds her six month old baby boy.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Good morning.<br/>
HILLY&#160;<br/>
Aibileen, the silver I lent&#160;<br/>Elizabeth last week.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
It not polished good? &#160;Humidity been&#160;<br/>fighting me on polishing day.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
When you returned it, three pieces&#160;<br/>were missing from the felt wrapper. &#160;<br/>A fork and two spoons.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=140></a>139.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Lemme...lemme&#160;go check in the&#160;<br/>kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
You know as well as I do that&#160;<br/>silver's not in the kitchen.<br/>
Aibileen turns to Elizabeth.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You check in Mae Mobley's bed? &#160;<br/>Since&#160;Lil'&#160;Man was born, she been&#160;<br/>putting things-<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Do you hear her, Elizabeth? &#160;She's&#160;<br/>trying to blame it on a toddler.<br/>
Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I ain't got no silver.<br/>
Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
She says she doesn't have them.<br/>
Mae Mobley runs into the room, heads straight for Aibileen.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Then it behooves me to inform you&#160;<br/>that you are fired, Aibileen. &#160;And&#160;<br/>I'll be calling the police.&#160;<br/>
Mae Mobley grabs Aibileen's skirt.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY&#160;<br/>
Aibee, my&#160;froat&#160;hurts.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I'll go get her some syrup, Miss&#160;<br/>Leefolt.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Elizabeth can take care of her own&#160;<br/>children.<br/>
Elizabeth looks to Hilly somewhat upset with this suggestion.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
I'll go get the cough syrup.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=141></a>140.<br/>
Aibileen reaches for the baby boy in Elizabeth's arms.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Come here,&#160;Lil'&#160;Man.<br/>
Hilly steps between Aibileen and Elizabeth.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
I'm okay.<br/>
Elizabeth takes&#160;Lil'&#160;Man and leaves the room.<br/>
Aibileen&#160;<br/>
stands firm in front of Hilly.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I didn't steal no silver.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Maybe I can't send you to jail for&#160;<br/>what you wrote, but I can send you&#160;<br/>for being a thief.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
(quickly)<br/>
I know something about you. &#160;Don't&#160;<br/>you forget that.<br/>
Hilly narrows her eyes.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
And from what Yule May says, they's&#160;<br/>a lot a time to write letters from&#160;<br/>jail. Plenty a time to write the&#160;<br/>truth about you, and the paper is&#160;<br/>free.<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Nobody would believe what you wrote.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I don't know. I been told I'm a&#160;<br/>pretty good writer!&#160;Already sold a&#160;<br/>lot a books!&#160;&#160;<br/>
Elizabeth returns with the syrup, Mae Mobley following<br/>behind. &#160;Aibileen approaches Hilly and leans into her face. &#160;<br/>
HILLY<br/>
Call the police, Elizabeth.<br/>
Elizabeth doesn't move.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
All you do is scare and lie to get&#160;<br/>what you want.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=142></a>141.<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Aibileen, stop!<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
(to Hilly)<br/>
You a godless woman. &#160;Ain't you&#160;<br/>tired, Miss Hilly? &#160;Ain't you tired?<br/>
Tears of shame and defeat stream down&#160;Hilly's face. &#160;Finally,&#160;<br/>she&#160;storms&#160;off into the living room<br/>
ELIZABETH<br/>
Aibileen, you have to go now.<br/>
Aibileen kneels down to Mae Mobley.<br/>
Aibileen begins to cry.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Don't go,&#160;Aibiee!<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Baby, you need to get back to bed.&#160;<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Please don't leave.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I&#160;gots&#160;to, Baby. &#160;I am so sorry.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Are you going to take care of&#160;<br/>another little girl?<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
No, that's not the reason. &#160;I don't&#160;<br/>want to leave you,&#160;but...it's&#160;time&#160;<br/>for me to retire. &#160;You my last&#160;<br/>little girl. &#160;<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Noooo!<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
Baby, baby, I need you to remember&#160;<br/>ever thing I told you. &#160;Okay? &#160;Do&#160;<br/>you remember what I told you?<br/>
Mae Mobley nods.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
You is kind. &#160;You is smart. &#160;You is&#160;<br/>important.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
That's right, Baby Girl.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=143></a>142.<br/>
Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. &#160;<br/>
Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Don't go,&#160;Aibee.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
I&#160;gots&#160;to, baby.<br/>
Aibileen takes her purse from an armchair and turns to&#160;<br/>Elizabeth.<br/>
AIBILEEN<br/>
You give my sweet girl a chance.&#160;<br/>
Elizabeth&#160;can't look Aibileen in the eye. &#160;Aibileen walks&#160;<br/>away.<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - MOMENTS LATER<br/>
Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse and walks&#160;<br/>stoically down the driveway. &#160;Tears stream down her face. &#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
Mae Mobley was my last baby. In just&#160;<br/>ten minutes, the only life I knew&#160;<br/>was done. &#160;<br/>
Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. &#160;She beats&#160;<br/>on the glass from inside. &#160;Aibileen never turns.<br/>
MAE MOBLEY<br/>
Aibeeeee! &#160;Don't go!<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
God says we need to love our&#160;<br/>enemies.<br/>
Aibileen stops walking, unable to continue, bending over to&#160;<br/>cry for a moment.&#160;<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
It hard to do.<br/>
Mae Mobley continues pounding on the glass, calling for&#160;<br/>Aibee.<br/>
INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DEN - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Elizabeth stands there, visibly upset.<br/>

AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
But it can start by telling the&#160;<br/>truth.<br/>
EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - DAY - CONTINUOUS<br/>
Aibileen attempts to regain her composure.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
No one had ever asked me what it&#160;<br/>felt like to be me. &#160;Once I told the&#160;<br/>truth about that I felt free.<br/>
Mae Mobley is still watching from the window as Aibileen&#160;<br/>straightens up and continues walking away from the house, up&#160;<br/>the street.<br/>
AIBILEEN (V.O.)<br/>
And I got to thinking about all the&#160;<br/>people I know, and the things I seen&#160;<br/>and done... &#160;My boy,&#160;Treelore,&#160;<br/>always said we&#160;gonna&#160;have a writer&#160;<br/>in the family one day. &#160;I guess it's&#160;<br/>gonna&#160;be me...<br/>
Her tears give way to&#160;a smile.<br/>
We pull up and away as she walks into the distance.<br/>
