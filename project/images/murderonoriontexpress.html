<i><b>MURDER ON THE&#160;</b></i><br/>
<i><b>ORIENT EXPRESS</b>&#160;</i><br/>
&#160;<br/>Agatha Christie is the world’s&#160;best known mystery writer. Her books have sold over a billion&#160;<br/>
copies in the English language and another billion in 44 foreign languages. She is the most&#160;<br/>widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.&#160;<br/>
Her writing career spanned more than half a&#160;century, during which she wrote 79 novels and&#160;<br/>
short story&#160;collections,&#160;as well&#160;as 14 plays, one of which,&#160;<i>The Mousetrap</i>, is the longest-running&#160;<br/>play in history. Two of the characters she created, the brilliant little Belgian Hercule Poirot and&#160;<br/>the irrepressible and relentless Miss Marple,&#160;went&#160;on to become&#160;world-famous detectives. Both&#160;<br/>have been widely dramatized in feature films and made-for-TV movies.&#160;<br/>
Agatha Christie also wrote&#160;six romantic novels under the pseudonym&#160;Mary Westmacott. As&#160;<br/>
well, she wrote four nonfiction books including an&#160;autobiography and an entertaining&#160;account of&#160;<br/>the many expeditions she shared with her archaeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan.&#160;<br/>
Agatha Christie died in 1976.&#160;<br/>

<b>1&#160;</b><br/>
<b>AN IMPORTANT PASSENGER&#160;ON THE TAURUS&#160;EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was five o’clock on a winter’s morning in Syria. Alongside the platform&#160;at Aleppo stood the&#160;<br/>train grandly designated in railway guides as the&#160;Taurus Express. It consisted of a kitchen and&#160;<br/>dining-car, a sleeping-car&#160;and two local coaches.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a&#160;young French lieutenant, resplendent in&#160;<br/>
uniform&#160;conversing, with a small man muffled up to&#160;the ears of whom&#160;nothing was visible but a&#160;<br/>pink-tipped nose and the two points of&#160;an upward-curled moustache.&#160;<br/>
It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be&#160;<br/>
envied, but Lieutenant&#160;Dubosc performed his part&#160;manfully. Graceful phrases fell from&#160;his lips in&#160;<br/>polished French. Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as&#160;<br/>there always were in such cases. The General’s—<i>his</i>&#160;General’s—temper had grown worse and&#160;<br/>worse. And then there had come&#160;this Belgian stranger—all the way from&#160;England, it seemed.&#160;<br/>There had been a week—a week of&#160;curious tensity. And then certain&#160;things had happened. A&#160;<br/>very distinguished officer had committed suicide,&#160;another had suddenly resigned, anxious faces&#160;<br/>had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military&#160;precautions were relaxed. And the General,&#160;<br/>Lieutenant Dubosc’s own particular General, had suddenly looked ten years younger.&#160;<br/>
Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him&#160;and the stranger. “You have saved&#160;<br/>
us,&#160;&#160;<i>mon cher</i>,” said the General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling as he spoke.&#160;<br/>“You have saved the honour of the French Army—you have averted much bloodshed! How can&#160;I&#160;<br/>thank you for acceding to my request?&#160;To have come&#160;so far—”&#160;<br/>
To which the stranger (by name&#160;M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the&#160;<br/>
phrase—“But indeed, do I not remember that&#160;once you saved my life?”&#160;And then the General&#160;<br/>had made another fitting reply to&#160;that, disclaiming any merit for that past&#160;service; and with more&#160;<br/>mention of France, of Belgium,&#160;of glory, of&#160;honour and of such kindred things they had&#160;<br/>embraced each other heartily and the conversation&#160;had ended.&#160;<br/>
As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him&#160;had been&#160;<br/>
delegated the duty of seeing off M.&#160;Poirot by the Taurus Express,&#160;and he was carrying it out with&#160;<br/>all the zeal and ardour&#160;befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him.&#160;<br/>
“To-day is Sunday,” said Lieutenant Dubosc.&#160;“Tomorrow, Monday evening, you will be in&#160;<br/>
Stamboul.”&#160;<br/>
It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on the platform, before&#160;<br/>
the departure of a train,&#160;are apt to be somewhat&#160;repetitive in character.&#160;<br/>
“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“And you intend to remain there a few days, I think?”&#160;<br/>“<i>Mais oui</i>. Stamboul, it is a city I have never visited. It would be a pity to pass through—<br/>
<i>comme ça</i>.” He snapped his fingers descriptively. “Nothing&#160;presses—I&#160;shall remain there as a&#160;<br/>tourist for a few days.”&#160;<br/>
“La Sainte Sophie, it is very fine,” said&#160;Lieutenant Dubosc, who had never seen it.&#160;<br/>A cold wind came whistling&#160;down the platform. Both men shivered.&#160;Lieutenant Dubosc&#160;<br/>
managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his&#160;watch. Five minutes to&#160;five—only five minutes&#160;<br/>more!&#160;<br/>
Fancying that the other man had noticed his&#160;glance, he hastened once more into speech.&#160;<br/>“There are few people travelling this&#160;time of year,” he said, glancing up&#160;at the windows of the&#160;<br/>
sleeping-car above them.&#160;<br/>
“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Let us hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus!”&#160;<br/>“That happens?”&#160;<br/>“It has occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.”&#160;<br/>“Let us hope, then,” said M. Poirot. “The&#160;weather reports from Europe, they are bad.&#160;<br/>“Very bad. In the Balkans there is much snow.”&#160;<br/>“In Germany, too, I have heard.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Eh bien</i>,” said Lieutenant Dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur.&#160;<br/>
“Tomorrow evening at&#160;seven-forty you will be in&#160;Constantinople.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes,” said M. Poirot, and went on desperately,&#160;“La Sainte Sophie, I have heard it is very&#160;<br/>
fine.”&#160;<br/>
“Magnificent, I believe.”&#160;<br/>Above their heads the blinds of&#160;one of the sleeping-car compartments was pushed aside and a&#160;<br/>
young woman looked out.&#160;<br/>
Mary Debenham had had little sleep since she left Baghdad on the preceding Thursday.&#160;<br/>
Neither in the train to Kirkuk, nor in the Rest House at Mosul, nor last night on the train had she&#160;<br/>slept properly. Now, weary of lying wakeful in&#160;the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment,&#160;<br/>she got up and peered out.&#160;<br/>
This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poorly lighted platform with&#160;<br/>
loud, furious altercations in&#160;Arabic going on somewhere. Two men below her window were&#160;<br/>talking French. One was a French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches.&#160;<br/>She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite&#160;so heavily muffled up. It must be very cold&#160;<br/>outside. That was why they heated the train so&#160;terribly. She tried to force the window down&#160;<br/>lower, but it would not go.&#160;<br/>
The Wagon Lit conductor had come&#160;up to the two men. The train was about to depart, he said.&#160;<br/>
Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed his hat. What an&#160;egg-shaped head he had!&#160;In&#160;<br/>spite of&#160;her preoccupations Mary Debenham&#160;smiled.&#160;A ridiculous-looking little man. The sort of&#160;<br/>little man one could never take seriously.&#160;<br/>
Lieutenant Dubosc was saying&#160;his parting speech. He had thought&#160;it out beforehand and had&#160;<br/>
kept it till the last minute. It was a very beautiful, polished speech.&#160;<br/>
Not to be outdone, M. Poirot replied in kind. ...&#160;<br/>“<i>En voiture,&#160;Monsieur</i>,” said the Wagon Lit conductor. With&#160;an air of infinite&#160;reluctance M.&#160;<br/>
Poirot climbed aboard the train. The conductor&#160;climbed after him.&#160;M. Poirot waved his hand.&#160;<br/>Lieutenant Dubosc came to the salute. The train,&#160;with a terrific jerk, moved slowly forward.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Enfin</i>!” murmured M. Hercule Poirot.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
8<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=9></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“<i>Brrrrrrrr</i>,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, realising to the full how cold he was.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>“<i>Voilà, Monsieur</i>!” The conductor displayed to Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of&#160;<br/>
his sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage.&#160;“The little valise of&#160;<br/>Monsieur, I have put it here.”&#160;<br/>
His outstretched hand was suggestive.&#160;Hercule Poirot placed in&#160;it a folded note.&#160;<br/>“<i>Merci, Monsieur</i>.” The conductor became brisk and business-like. “I have the tickets of&#160;<br/>
Monsieur. I will also take the passport, please. Monsieur breaks his&#160;journey in Stamboul, I&#160;<br/>understand?”&#160;<br/>
M. Poirot assented. “There are not many people travelling, I imagine?” he said.&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur. I have only two other passengers—both English. A Colonel from&#160;India and a&#160;<br/>
young English lady from Baghdad. Monsieur requires anything?”&#160;<br/>
Monsieur demanded a small bottle of&#160;Perrier.&#160;<br/>Five o’clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train. There were still two hours&#160;<br/>
before dawn. Conscious of an&#160;inadequate night’s sleep, and of&#160;a delicate mission successfully&#160;<br/>accomplished, M. Poirot curled up in a corner and&#160;fell asleep.&#160;<br/>
When he awoke it was half-past nine he sallied&#160;forth to the restaurant&#160;car in search of hot&#160;<br/>
coffee.&#160;<br/>
There was only one occupant at the moment, obviously the young English lady referred to by&#160;<br/>
the conductor. She was tall, slim&#160;and dark—perhaps&#160;twenty-eight years of age. There was a kind&#160;<br/>of cool efficiency in the way she was eating&#160;her breakfast and in the way she called to the&#160;<br/>attendant to bring her&#160;more coffee which bespoke a knowledge&#160;of the world and of travelling.&#160;<br/>She wore a dark-coloured travelling dress of some&#160;thin material eminently&#160;suitable&#160;for the heated&#160;<br/>atmosphere of the train.&#160;<br/>
M. Hercule Poirot, having nothing better to do, amused&#160;himself by studying her without&#160;<br/>
appearing to do so.&#160;<br/>
She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who&#160;could take care of herself with perfect&#160;<br/>
ease wherever she went. She had poise and efficiency. He rather liked the severe regularity of her&#160;<br/>features and&#160;the delicate pallor of her skin. He liked the burnished black head with its neat waves&#160;<br/>of hair, and her eyes—cool, impersonal and grey.&#160;But she was, he decided, just&#160;a little&#160;too&#160;<br/>efficient to be&#160;what he called “<i>jolie femme</i>.”&#160;<br/>
Presently another person entered&#160;the restaurant&#160;car. This was&#160;a&#160;tall man of between forty and&#160;<br/>
fifty, lean of figure, brown of skin, with&#160;hair slightly grizzled round the temples.&#160;<br/>
“The Colonel from&#160;India,” said Poirot to himself.&#160;<br/>The newcomer gave a little bow to the girl. “Morning, Miss Debenham.”&#160;<br/>“Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot.”&#160;<br/>The Colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her.&#160;<br/>“Any objections?”&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>“Of course not. Sit down.”&#160;<br/>“Well, you know, breakfast isn’t always a chatty meal.”&#160;<br/>“I should hope not. But I don’t bite.”&#160;<br/>The Colonel sat down. “Boy,” he called in peremptory fashion.&#160;<br/>He gave an order for eggs and coffee.&#160;<br/>His eyes rested for a moment on Hercule Poirot, but they passed on indifferently. Poirot,&#160;<br/>
reading the English mind correctly, knew that he&#160;had said to himself. “Only some&#160;damned&#160;<br/>foreigner.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
9<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
True to their&#160;nationality, the two English people were not chatty. They&#160;exchanged a few brief&#160;<br/>
remarks and presently the girl rose and went back to her compartment.&#160;<br/>
At lunch time the other two again&#160;shared a table and again&#160;they both completely ignored the&#160;<br/>
third passenger. Their conversation was more animated than&#160;at breakfast. Colonel Arbuthnot&#160;<br/>talked of the Punjab and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about Baghdad where, it&#160;<br/>became clear, she had been in a&#160;post as governess. In the course&#160;of conversation they discovered&#160;<br/>some&#160;mutual friends, which had the immediate effect of making them&#160;more friendly and less&#160;<br/>stiff. They discussed old&#160;Tommy Somebody and old Reggie&#160;Someone Else. The Colonel&#160;<br/>inquired whether she was going straight through to England or whether she was stopping in&#160;<br/>Stamboul.&#160;<br/>
“No, I’m&#160;going straight on.”&#160;<br/>“Isn’t that rather a pity?”&#160;<br/>“I came out this way two years ago and&#160;spent three days in Stamboul then.”&#160;<br/>“Oh! I see. Well, I may say I’m&#160;very glad you are going right through, because I am.”&#160;<br/>He made a kind of clumsy&#160;little bow, flushing a little as he did so.&#160;<br/>“He is susceptible, our Colonel,” thought Hercule Poirot to himself with some amusement.&#160;<br/>
“The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”&#160;<br/>
Miss Debenham&#160;said evenly that that would be&#160;very nice. Her manner was slightly repressive.&#160;<br/>The Colonel, Hercule Poirot noticed, accompanied her back to her compartment. Later they&#160;<br/>
passed through the magnificent scenery of the Taurus. As they looked down towards the Cilician&#160;<br/>Gates, standing in the corridor side by side,&#160;a sigh came suddenly from the girl. Poirot was&#160;<br/>standing near them&#160;and heard her murmur:&#160;<br/>
“It’s so beautiful!&#160;I wish—I wish—”&#160;<br/>“Yes?”&#160;<br/>“I wish I could enjoy it!”&#160;<br/>Arbuthnot did not answer. The square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and grimmer.&#160;<br/>“I wish to Heaven you were out of all this,” he said.&#160;<br/>“Hush, please. Hush.”&#160;<br/>“Oh! it’s all right.” He shot a slightly annoyed&#160;glance in Poirot’s direction. Then he went on:&#160;<br/>
“But I don’t like the idea of your&#160;being a governess—at the beck and call of tyrannical mothers&#160;<br/>and their tiresome&#160;brats.”&#160;<br/>
She laughed with just a hint&#160;of uncontrol in the sound.&#160;<br/>“Oh! you mustn’t think that.&#160;The downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth. I can&#160;<br/>
assure you that it’s the parents&#160;who are afraid of being bullied by&#160;<i>me</i>.”&#160;<br/>
They said no more. Arbuthnot was,&#160;perhaps, ashamed of his outburst.&#160;<br/>“Rather an odd little comedy that I watch here,” said Poirot to himself thoughtfully.&#160;<br/>He was to remember that thought of his later.&#160;<br/>They arrived at Konya that night about half-past eleven. The two English travellers got out to&#160;<br/>
stretch their legs, pacing up&#160;and down the snowy platform.&#160;<br/>
M. Poirot was content to watch the teeming&#160;activity of the station through a window pane.&#160;<br/>
After about ten minutes, however, he decided that&#160;a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad&#160;<br/>thing after all. He made careful&#160;preparations, wrapping himself in&#160;several coats and mufflers and&#160;<br/>encasing his&#160;neat boots in goloshes.&#160;Thus attired, he descended gingerly to the platform and&#160;<br/>began to pace its length. He&#160;walked out beyond the engine.&#160;<br/>
It was&#160;the&#160;voices which gave him&#160;the clue to&#160;the&#160;two indistinct figures&#160;standing in the shadow&#160;<br/>
of a traffic van. Arbuthnot was speaking.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“Mary—”&#160;<br/>The girl interrupted him.&#160;<br/>“Not now. Not now. When it’s&#160;all over. When it’s behind us—<i>then</i>—”&#160;<br/>Discreetly M. Poirot turned away. He wondered. ...&#160;<br/>He would hardly have recognised the cool, efficient voice of Miss Debenham. ...&#160;<br/>“Curious,” he said to himself.&#160;<br/>The next day he wondered whether,&#160;perhaps, they had quarrelled. They spoke little to each&#160;<br/>
other. The girl, he thought, looked anxious. There were dark circles under her eyes.&#160;<br/>
It was about half-past two in the afternoon when the train came&#160;to a halt. Heads were poked&#160;<br/>
out of windows. A little knot of men were clustered by the side of the&#160;line looking and pointing&#160;<br/>at something under the dining-car.&#160;<br/>
Poirot leaned out and spoke to the Wagon&#160;Lit conductor who was hurrying past. The man&#160;<br/>
answered, and Poirot drew back his head and,&#160;turning, almost collided with Mary Debenham&#160;<br/>who was standing just behind him.&#160;<br/>
“What is the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in French. “Why are we stopping?”&#160;<br/>“It is nothing, Mademoiselle.&#160;It is something that has caught fire under the dining-car.&#160;<br/>
Nothing serious. It is put out. They are now repairing the damage. There is no danger, I assure&#160;<br/>you.”&#160;<br/>
She made a little abrupt gesture, as though&#160;she were waving the idea&#160;of danger aside as&#160;<br/>
something completely unimportant.&#160;<br/>
“Yes, yes, I understand that. But the&#160;<i>time</i>!”&#160;<br/>“The time?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, this will delay us.”&#160;<br/>“It is possible—yes,” agreed Poirot.&#160;<br/>“But we can’t afford delay! This train is due&#160;in at 6.55, and one has to cross the Bosphorus&#160;<br/>
and catch the Simplon Orient Express on the other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two&#160;<br/>of delay we shall miss the connection.”&#160;<br/>
“It is possible, yes,” he admitted.&#160;<br/>He looked at her curiously. The hand that held&#160;the window bar was not quite steady; her lips,&#160;<br/>
too, were trembling.&#160;<br/>
“Does it matter to you very much, Mademoiselle?”&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>“Yes. Yes, it does. I—I&#160;<i>must</i>&#160;catch that train.”&#160;<br/>She turned away from&#160;him and went down the corridor to join Colonel Arbuthnot.&#160;<br/>Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later the&#160;train&#160;started again. It arrived at&#160;<br/>
Hayda-passar only five minutes late,&#160;having made up time on the journey.&#160;<br/>
The Bosphorus was rough and M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He&#160;was separated from&#160;<br/>
his travelling companions on the boat and did not see them&#160;again.&#160;<br/>
On arrival at the Galata Bridge he drove straight to the Tokatlian Hotel.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<b>THE TOKATLIAN HOTEL&#160;</b><br/>
At the Tokatlian, Hercule Poirot asked for a room&#160;with bath. Then he stepped over to the&#160;<br/>concierge’s desk and inquired for letters.&#160;<br/>
There were three waiting&#160;for him&#160;and a telegram. His eyebrows rose a little at the sight of the&#160;<br/>
telegram. It was unexpected.&#160;<br/>
He opened it in his usual neat, unhurried&#160;fashion. The printed words stood out clearly.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>Development you predicted in Kassner case&#160;has come unexpectedly. Please return&#160;</i><br/>
<i>immediately.&#160;<br/></i>&#160;<br/>“<i>Voilà ce&#160;qui est embêtant</i>,” muttered Poirot vexedly. He glanced up at the clock. “I shall&#160;<br/>
have to go on to-night,” he said to the concierge. “At what time&#160;does the Simplon Orient leave?”&#160;<br/>
“At nine o’clock, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Can you get me&#160;a sleeper?”&#160;<br/>“Assuredly, Monsieur. There is no difficulty this&#160;time of year. The trains&#160;are almost empty.&#160;<br/>
First-class or&#160;second?”&#160;<br/>
“First.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Très bien, Monsieur</i>. How far are you going?”&#160;<br/>“To London.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Bien, Monsieur</i>. I will get you a ticket to London and reserve your sleeping-car&#160;<br/>
accommodation in the Stamboul-Calais coach.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot glanced at the clock&#160;again. It was ten minutes to&#160;eight. “I have time to dine?”&#160;<br/>“But assuredly, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>The little Belgian nodded. He went&#160;over and cancelled his room&#160;order and crossed the hall to&#160;<br/>
the restaurant.&#160;<br/>
As he was giving his order to the waiter, a hand was placed on his shoulder.&#160;<br/>“Ah,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>, but this is an unexpected pleasure!” said a voice behind him.&#160;<br/>The speaker was a short stout&#160;elderly man, his hair cut&#160;<i>en brosse</i>. He was smiling delightedly.&#160;<br/>Poiret sprang up.&#160;<br/>“M. Bouc!”&#160;<br/>“M. Poirot!”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc was a Belgian, a director of&#160;the Compagnie Internationale&#160;des Wagons Lits, and his&#160;<br/>
acquaintance with the former star of the&#160;Belgian police force dated back many years.&#160;<br/>
“You find yourself far from&#160;home,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“A little affair in Syria.”&#160;<br/>“Ah! and you return home—when?”&#160;<br/>“To-night.”&#160;<br/>“Splendid! I, too. That is to say, I go as far as&#160;Lausanne, where I have affairs. You travel on&#160;<br/>
the Simplon Orient, I presume?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes. I have just asked&#160;them&#160;to get me a sleeper. It&#160;was my intention to remain here some&#160;<br/>
days, but I have. received a telegram&#160;recalling me&#160;to England on important business.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
12<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Ah!” sighed M. Bouc. “<i>Les affaires—les affaires</i>! But you, you are at the top of the tree&#160;<br/>
nowadays,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>!”&#160;<br/>
“Some little&#160;success I have had, perhaps.” Hercule Poirot tried to look modest but failed&#160;<br/>
signally.&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc laughed.&#160;<br/>“We will meet later,” he said.&#160;<br/>Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task&#160;of keeping his moustaches out of the soup.&#160;<br/>That difficult task accomplished, he glanced round him&#160;whilst waiting for the next course.&#160;<br/>
There were only about half a dozen people in the&#160;restaurant, and of those half dozen there were&#160;<br/>only two that interested Hercule Poirot.&#160;<br/>
These two sat at a table not far away. The younger was a likeable-looking young man of&#160;<br/>
thirty, clearly an American. It was, however,&#160;not he but his companion who had attracted the&#160;<br/>little detective’s attention.&#160;<br/>
He was a man perhaps of&#160;between sixty and seventy. From a little distance he had the bland&#160;<br/>
aspect of a philanthropist. His&#160;slightly bald head, his domed&#160;forehead, the smiling mouth that&#160;<br/>displayed a very white set of false teeth—all seemed to speak of&#160;a benevolent personality. Only&#160;<br/>the eyes belied this assumption. They were small, deep-set&#160;and crafty. Not only that. As the man,&#160;<br/>making some remark to his young companion, glanced across the room, his gaze stopped on&#160;<br/>Poirot for a moment and just for that second there was a strange malevolence, an unnatural&#160;<br/>tensity in the glance.&#160;<br/>
Then he rose.&#160;<br/>“Pay the bill, Hector,” he said.&#160;<br/>His voice was slightly husky in tone.&#160;It had a queer, soft, dangerous quality.&#160;<br/>When Poirot rejoined his friend in the lounge,&#160;the other two men were just leaving the hotel.&#160;<br/>
Their luggage was being brought down. The younger&#160;was supervising the process. Presently he&#160;<br/>opened the glass door and said:&#160;<br/>
“Quite ready now, Mr. Ratchett.”&#160;<br/>The elder man grunted an&#160;assent and passed out.&#160;<br/>“<i>Eh bien</i>,” said Poirot. “What do you think of those two?”&#160;<br/>“They are Americans,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Assuredly they are Americans. I meant what did you think of their personalities?”&#160;<br/>“The young man seemed quite agreeable.”&#160;<br/>“And the other?”&#160;<br/>“To tell you the truth, my friend, I did not care for him. He produced on me&#160;an unpleasant&#160;<br/>
impression. And you?”&#160;<br/>
Hercule Poirot was a moment in replying.&#160;<br/>“When he passed me in the restaurant,” he said&#160;at last, “I had a curious impression. It was as&#160;<br/>
though a wild animal—an animal savage, but savage! you understand—had passed me by.”&#160;<br/>
“And yet he looked altogether&#160;of the most respectable.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Précisément</i>! The body—the cage—is everything of the most respectable—but through the&#160;<br/>
bars, the wild animal looks out.”&#160;<br/>
“You are fanciful,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“It may be so. But I could not rid myself of&#160;the impression that evil had passed me&#160;by very&#160;<br/>
close.”&#160;<br/>
“That respectable American gentleman?”&#160;<br/>“That respectable American gentleman.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“Well,” said&#160;M. Bouc cheerfully, “it may be so. There is&#160;much evil in the world.”&#160;<br/>At that moment the door opened and the concierge came towards them. He looked concerned&#160;<br/>
and apologetic.&#160;<br/>
“It is&#160;extraordinary,&#160;Monsieur,”&#160;he said to Poirot. “There is&#160;not one first-class sleeping berth&#160;<br/>
to be had on the train.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Comment</i>?” cried M. Bouc. “At this&#160;time of year? Ah, without doubt&#160;there is some&#160;party of&#160;<br/>
journalists—of&#160;politicians—?”&#160;<br/>
“I don’t know, sir,” said the concierge, turning to him&#160;respectfully. “But that’s how it is.”&#160;<br/>“Well, well.” M. Bouc turned to Poirot. “Have&#160;no&#160;fear, my&#160;friend. We will arrange something.&#160;<br/>
There is always one compartment, the No. 16, which is not engaged. The conductor sees to that!”&#160;<br/>He smiled, then glanced up at the clock. “Come,”&#160;he said, “it is time we started.”&#160;<br/>
At the station M. Bouc was greeted with respectful empressement by the brown-uniformed&#160;<br/>
Wagon Lit conductor.&#160;<br/>
“Good evening, Monsieur. Your compartment is the No. 1.”&#160;<br/>He called to the porters and they wheeled their load halfway along the carriage on which the&#160;<br/>
tin plates proclaimed its destination:&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<b>ISTANBUL TRIESTE CALAIS&#160;</b><br/>
&#160;<br/>“You are full up to-night, I hear?”&#160;<br/>“It is incredible, Monsieur. All the world elects to travel&#160;to-night!”&#160;<br/>“All the same&#160;you must find room for this gentleman here. He is a friend of mine. He can&#160;<br/>
have the No. 16.”&#160;<br/>
“It is taken, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“What?&#160;The No. 16?”&#160;<br/>A glance of understanding passed between them, and the conductor smiled. He was a tall&#160;<br/>
sallow man of middle age.&#160;<br/>
“But yes, Monsieur. As I told you, we&#160;are full—full—everywhere.”&#160;<br/>“But what passes itself?” demanded&#160;M. Bouc angrily.&#160;“There is&#160;a conference somewhere? It is&#160;<br/>
a party?”&#160;<br/>
“No, Monsieur. It is only chance. It just happens that many people have elected to travel to-<br/>
night.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc made a clicking sound of annoyance.&#160;<br/>“At Belgrade,” he said,&#160;“there will be the&#160;slip coach from&#160;Athens. There will also be the&#160;<br/>
Bucharest-Paris coach. But we do&#160;not reach Belgrade until to-morrow evening. The problem&#160;is&#160;<br/>for to-night. There is no&#160;second-class berth free?”&#160;<br/>
“There is a second-class berth, Monsieur—”&#160;<br/>“Well, then—”&#160;<br/>“But it is a lady’s berth. there is already&#160;a German woman&#160;in the compartment—a lady’s&#160;<br/>
maid.”&#160;<br/>
“Là- là, that is awkward,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Do not distress yourself, my friend,” said Poirot. “I must travel in&#160;an ordinary carriage.”&#160;<br/>“Not at all. Not at all.” He turned once more to the conductor. “Everyone has arrived?”&#160;<br/>“It is true,” said the man, “that there is one&#160;passenger who has not&#160;yet arrived.” He spoke&#160;<br/>
slowly, with hesitation.&#160;<br/>
“But speak then!”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“No. 7 berth—a second-class. The gentleman has not yet come, and it is four minutes to&#160;<br/>
nine.”&#160;<br/>
“Who is it?”&#160;<br/>“An Englishman,” the conductor consulted his list. “A M. Harris.”&#160;<br/>“A name&#160;of good omen,” said Poirot. “I read&#160;my&#160;Dickens. M.&#160;Harris he will not arrive.”&#160;<br/>“Put Monsieur’s luggage&#160;in No. 7,” said M. Bouc. “If&#160;this M.&#160;Harris arrives we will tell him&#160;<br/>
that he is too late—that berths cannot be retained&#160;so long—we will arrange the matter one way or&#160;<br/>another. What do I care for a M. Harris?”&#160;<br/>
“As Monsieur pleases,” said the conductor. He&#160;spoke to Poirot’s porter, directing him where&#160;<br/>
to go. Then he stood aside from&#160;the steps to let Poirot enter the train.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Tout à fait au bout, Monsieur</i>,” he called. “The end compartment but one.”&#160;<br/>Poirot passed along the corridor, a somewhat&#160;slow progress, since most of the people&#160;<br/>
travelling were standing&#160;outside their carriages.&#160;<br/>
His polite “Pardons” were uttered with the regularity of clockwork. At last he reached the&#160;<br/>
compartment indicated. Inside it,&#160;reaching up to a suitcase, was the tall&#160;young American of the&#160;<br/>Tokatlian.&#160;<br/>
He frowned as Poirot entered.&#160;<br/>“Excuse me,” he said. “I think you’ve made&#160;a mistake.” Then, laboriously in French: “<i>Je crois&#160;</i><br/>
<i>qua vous avez un erreur</i>.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot replied in English. “You are Mr. Harris?”&#160;<br/>“No, my&#160;name&#160;is MacQueen. I—”&#160;<br/>But at that moment the voice of the Wagon Lit conductor spoke from&#160;over&#160;Poirot’s&#160;<br/>
shoulder—an apologetic, rather breathless voice.&#160;<br/>
“There is no other berth on the train, Monsieur. The gentleman has to come&#160;in here.”&#160;<br/>He was hauling up the corridor window as he spoke and began to lift in Poirot’s luggage.&#160;<br/>Poirot noticed the apology in his tone with&#160;some&#160;amusement. Doubtless the man had been&#160;<br/>
promised a good tip if he could keep the compartment for the sole use of&#160;the other traveller.&#160;<br/>However, even the most munificent of tips lose their effect when a Director of the Company is&#160;<br/>on board and issues his orders.&#160;<br/>
The conductor emerged from&#160;the compartment,&#160;having swung the suitcases up onto the racks.&#160;<br/>“<i>Voilà, Monsieur</i>,” he said. “All is arranged. Yours is&#160;the upper berth, the No. 7. We&#160;start in&#160;<br/>
one minute.”&#160;<br/>
He hurried off down the corridor. Poirot re-entered the compartment.&#160;<br/>“A phenomenon I have seldom&#160;seen,” he said cheerfully. “A&#160;Wagon&#160;Lit conductor himself&#160;<br/>
puts up the luggage! It is unheard of!”&#160;<br/>
His fellow traveller smiled. He had evidently got over his annoyance—had probably decided&#160;<br/>
that it was no good to take the matter otherwise than philosophically. “The train’s remarkably&#160;<br/>full,” he said.&#160;<br/>
A whistle blew, there was a long melancholy cry&#160;from&#160;the engine. Both men stepped out into&#160;<br/>
the corridor.&#160;Outside a voice shouted,&#160;“En voiture!”&#160;<br/>
“We’re off,” said MacQueen.&#160;<br/>But they were not quite off. The whistle blew again.&#160;<br/>“I say, sir,” said the young man&#160;suddenly. “If you’d rather have&#160;the lower berth—easier and&#160;<br/>
all that—well, that’s&#160;all right by me.”&#160;<br/>
A likeable young fellow.&#160;<br/>“No, no,” protested Poirot.&#160;“I would not deprive you—”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“That’s all right—”&#160;<br/>“You are too amiable—”&#160;<br/>Polite protests on both sides.&#160;<br/>“It is for one night only,” explained Poirot. “At Belgrade—”&#160;<br/>“Oh! I see. You’re getting out at Belgrade—”&#160;<br/>“Not exactly. You see—”&#160;<br/>There was a sudden jerk. Both men swung round to the window, looking out at the long&#160;<br/>
lighted platform&#160;as it slid slowly past them.&#160;<br/>
The Orient Express had started on its three-day journey across Europe.&#160;<br/>

<b>POIROT REFUSES A CASE&#160;</b><br/>
M. Hercule&#160;Poirot was a little late in entering the luncheon-car on&#160;the following day. He had&#160;<br/>risen early, had breakfasted almost alone, and had spent the morning going over the notes of the&#160;<br/>case that was recalling him&#160;to London. He had seen little of his&#160;travelling companion.&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc, who was already seated, gated a greeting and summoned his friend to the empty&#160;<br/>
place opposite him. Poirot sat down and soon found himself in the&#160;favoured position&#160;of being at&#160;<br/>the table which was served first and with the choicest morsels. The food, too, was unusually&#160;<br/>good.&#160;<br/>
It was not till they were eating a delicate cream&#160;cheese that M. Bouc allowed his attention to&#160;<br/>
wander to matters other than nourishment. He was at the stage of a meal when one becomes&#160;<br/>philosophic.&#160;<br/>
“Ah!” he sighed. “If I had but the pen of a Balzac! I would depict this&#160;scene.” He waved a&#160;<br/>
hand.&#160;<br/>
“It is an idea, that,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Ah, you agree?&#160;It has not been done, I think? And yet—it lends itself to romance, my friend.&#160;<br/>
All around us are people, of all classes, of all nationalities, of&#160;all ages. For three days these&#160;<br/>people, these strangers to one another, are brought together. They sleep&#160;and eat under one roof,&#160;<br/>they cannot get away from&#160;each other. At the end&#160;of three days they part, they go their several&#160;<br/>ways, never perhaps to see each other again.”&#160;<br/>
“And yet,” said Poirot, “suppose an accident—”&#160;<br/>“Ah, no, my&#160;friend—”&#160;<br/>“From&#160;your point of view it would&#160;be regrettable, I agree. But nevertheless let us just for one&#160;<br/>
moment suppose it. Then, perhaps, all these here are linked together—by death.”&#160;<br/>
“Some more&#160;wine,” said M. Bouc,&#160;hastily pouring it out. “You are morbid,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>. It is,&#160;<br/>
perhaps the digestion.”&#160;<br/>
“It is true,” agreed Poirot, “that the food&#160;in Syria was not perhaps quite suited to my&#160;<br/>
stomach.”&#160;<br/>
He sipped his wine. Then, leaning back, he ran his eye thoughtfully round the dining-car.&#160;<br/>
There were thirteen people seated&#160;there and, as M. Bouc had said,&#160;of all classes and nationalities.&#160;<br/>He began to study them.&#160;<br/>
At the table opposite them&#160;were three men. They&#160;were, he guessed, single travellers graded&#160;<br/>
and placed there by the unerring judgment of the restaurant attendants. A big swarthy Italian was&#160;<br/>picking his teeth with gusto. Opposite him&#160;a spare neat Englishman had the expressionless&#160;<br/>disapproving face of the well-trained servant. Next to&#160;the Englishman was a big&#160;American in a&#160;<br/>loud suit—possibly a commercial traveller.&#160;<br/>
“You’ve got to put it over&#160;<i>big</i>,” he was saying in a loud, nasal voice.&#160;<br/>The Italian removed his toothpick&#160;to gesticulate with it freely.&#160;<br/>“Sure,” he said. “That whatta I say alla de time.”&#160;<br/>The Englishman looked out of the window and coughed.&#160;<br/>Poirot’s eye passed on.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<a name=18></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
At a small table, sitting very upright, was one of&#160;the ugliest old ladies he had ever seen. It was&#160;<br/>
an ugliness of distinction—it fascinated rather than repelled. She sat very upright. Round her&#160;<br/>neck was a collar of very large pearls which,&#160;improbable though it seemed, were real. Her hands&#160;<br/>were covered with rings. Her sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders. A very small and&#160;<br/>expensive black toque was hideously&#160;unbecoming&#160;to the yellow, toad-like face beneath it.&#160;<br/>
She was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear, courteous, but completely&#160;<br/>
autocratic tone.&#160;<br/>
“You will be sufficiently amiable to place in my&#160;compartment a bottle of&#160;mineral water and&#160;a&#160;<br/>
large glass of orange juice. You&#160;will arrange that I shall have&#160;chicken cooked without sauces for&#160;<br/>dinner this evening—also some&#160;boiled fish.”&#160;<br/>
The attendant replied respectfully that it should be done.&#160;<br/>She gave a slight gracious nod&#160;of the head and rose. Her glance caught Poirot’s and swept&#160;<br/>
over him&#160;with the nonchalance of&#160;the uninterested aristocrat.&#160;<br/>
“That is Princess Dragomiroff,” said M. Bouc&#160;in a low tone. “She is a Russian. Her husband&#160;<br/>
realised all his money before&#160;the Revolution and invested it abroad. She is extremely rich. A&#160;<br/>cosmopolitan.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot nodded. He had heard of Princess Dragomiroff.&#160;<br/>“She is a personality,” said M. Bouc. “Ugly&#160;as sin but she makes herself felt. You agree?”&#160;<br/>Poirot agreed.&#160;<br/>At another of the large tables Mary Debenham&#160;was sitting&#160;with two other women. One of&#160;<br/>
them&#160;was tall and middle-aged, in a plaid blouse&#160;and tweed skirt. She had a mass of faded yellow&#160;<br/>hair unbecomingly arranged in a large bun, wore glasses, and had a long mild amiable face rather&#160;<br/>like a sheep. She was listening to the third woman, a stout, pleasant-faced, elderly person who&#160;<br/>was talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no signs of pausing for breath or coming to&#160;<br/>a stop.&#160;<br/>
“—and so my daughter said, ‘Why,’ she said, ‘you&#160;just can’t apply American methods in this&#160;<br/>
country. It’s natural to the folks&#160;here to be indolent,’&#160;she said. ‘They just haven’t got any hustle&#160;<br/>in them—’ But all the same you’d be surprised&#160;to know what our college there is doing. They’ve&#160;<br/>got a fine staff of teachers. I guess&#160;there’s&#160;nothing like education.&#160;We’ve got to&#160;apply our&#160;<br/>Western ideals and teach the East to&#160;recognise them. My daughter says—”&#160;<br/>
The train plunged into a tunnel. The calm,&#160;monotonous voice was drowned.&#160;<br/>At the next table, a small one, sat Colonel Arbuthnot—alone. His gaze was fixed upon the&#160;<br/>
back of Mary Debenham’s head. They were not sitting together.&#160;Yet it could&#160;easily have been&#160;<br/>managed. Why?&#160;<br/>
Perhaps, Poirot thought, Mary Debenham had&#160;demurred. A governess learns to be careful.&#160;<br/>
Appearances are important. A girl with&#160;her living to get has to be discreet.&#160;<br/>
His glance shifted to the other&#160;side of the carriage. At the&#160;far end, against the wall, was a&#160;<br/>
middle-aged woman dressed in black with&#160;a broad,&#160;expressionless face.&#160;German or&#160;<br/>Scandinavian, he thought. Probably the German lady’s-maid.&#160;<br/>
Beyond her were a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly together. The man wore&#160;<br/>
English clothes of loose tweed, but he was not&#160;English. Though only the back of his head was&#160;<br/>visible to Poirot, the shape of&#160;it and the set of the shoulders betrayed him.&#160;A big man, well made.&#160;<br/>He turned his head suddenly and Poirot saw his&#160;profile. A very handsome man of thirty-odd with&#160;<br/>a big fair moustache.&#160;<br/>
The woman opposite him&#160;was a mere girl—twenty&#160;at a guess. A tight-fitting little black coat&#160;<br/>
and skirt, white satin blouse, small chic black toque perched at&#160;the fashionable outrageous angle.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=19></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
She had a beautiful foreign-looking face, dead white skin,&#160;large brown eyes, jet black hair.&#160;She&#160;<br/>was smoking a cigarette in a long holder. Her manicured hands had deep red nails. She wore one&#160;<br/>large emerald set in platinum. There was coquetry in her glance and voice.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Elle est jolie—et chic</i>,” murmured Poirot.&#160;“Husband and wife—eh?”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc nodded. “Hungarian Embassy, I believe,” he said. “A handsome couple.”&#160;<br/>There were only two more lunchers—Poirot’s fellow traveller MacQueen and his employer&#160;<br/>
Mr. Ratchett. The latter sat facing Poirot, and for the second time Poirot studied that&#160;<br/>unprepossessing face, noting the false benevolence of the brow&#160;and the small, cruel eyes.&#160;<br/>
Doubtless M. Bouc saw a change in his friend’s expression.&#160;<br/>“It is at your wild animal you look?”&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded.&#160;<br/>As his coffee was brought to him, M. Bouc rose&#160;to his feet. Having started before Poirot he&#160;<br/>
had finished some&#160;time&#160;ago.&#160;<br/>
“I return to my compartment,” he said.&#160;“Come along presently and converse with me.”&#160;<br/>“With pleasure.”&#160;<br/>Poirot sipped his coffee and ordered a liqueur. The attendant was passing from&#160;table to table&#160;<br/>
with his&#160;box of money, accepting payment for&#160;bills. The elderly American lady’s voice rose&#160;<br/>shrill and plaintive.&#160;<br/>
“My daughter said: ‘Take a book of food tickets and you’ll have no trouble—no trouble at&#160;<br/>
all.’ Now, that isn’t so. Seems they have to have&#160;a ten per cent tip, and then&#160;there’s that bottle of&#160;<br/>mineral water—and a queer sort of water too. They&#160;didn’t have any Evian or Vichy, which seems&#160;<br/>queer to me.”&#160;<br/>
“It is—they must—how do you say?—serve the water of the country,” explained the sheep-<br/>
faced lady.&#160;<br/>
“Well, it seems queer to me.” She looked distastefully at the heap of small change on the table&#160;<br/>
in front of her. “Look at all this peculiar stuff he’s given me. Dinars or something. Just a lot of&#160;<br/>rubbish, it looks like! My daughter said—”&#160;<br/>
Mary Debenham pushed back her chair and left with a slight bow to the other two. Colonel&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot got up and followed her. Gathering&#160;up her despised money the American woman&#160;<br/>followed suit, followed by the other one like a sheep. The Hungarians had already departed. The&#160;<br/>restaurant&#160;car was empty save for&#160;Poirot and Ratchett and MacQueen.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett spoke to his companion, who got up and left the car. Then he rose himself, but&#160;<br/>
instead of following MacQueen he dropped unexpectedly into the seat opposite Poirot.&#160;<br/>
“Can you oblige me&#160;with a light?” he said. His&#160;voice was soft—faintly nasal. “My name&#160;is&#160;<br/>
Ratchett.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot bowed slightly. He slipped his hand into his pocket and produced a matchbox which he&#160;<br/>
handed to the other man, who took&#160;it but did not strike a light.&#160;<br/>
“I think,” he went on, “that I have the pleasure of&#160;speaking to Mr. Hercule&#160;Poirot. Is that so?”&#160;<br/>Poirot bowed again. “You have been&#160;correctly informed, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>The detective was conscious of those strange&#160;shrewd eyes summing him&#160;up before&#160;the other&#160;<br/>
spoke again.&#160;<br/>
“In my country,” he said, “we come&#160;to the point quickly. Mr. Poirot,&#160;I want you to take on a&#160;<br/>
job for me.”&#160;<br/>
Hercule Poirot’s eyebrows went up a trifle.&#160;<br/>“My<i>&#160;clientèle</i>, Monsieur, is limited nowadays. I undertake very few cases.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
19<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Why, naturally, I understand that.&#160;But this, Mr. Poirot, means big money.” He repeated again&#160;<br/>
in his soft, persuasive voice, “Big money.”&#160;<br/>
Hercule Poirot was silent a minute or two. Then&#160;he said: “What is it you wish me&#160;to do for&#160;<br/>
you, Monsieur—er—Ratchett?”&#160;<br/>
“Mr. Poirot, I am&#160;a rich man—a very&#160;rich man.&#160;Men in that position have enemies. I have an&#160;<br/>
enemy.”&#160;<br/>
“Only one enemy?”&#160;<br/>“Just what do you mean by that question?” asked Ratchett sharply.&#160;<br/>“Monsieur, in my&#160;experience when a man is in&#160;a position to have, as you say, enemies, then it&#160;<br/>
does not usually resolve itself into one enemy only.”&#160;<br/>
Ratchett seemed relieved by—Poirot’s answer. He said quickly:&#160;<br/>“Why, yes, I appreciate that point. Enemy or enemies—it doesn’t matter. What does matter is&#160;<br/>
my safety.”&#160;<br/>
“Safety?”&#160;<br/>“My life has been threatened, Mr. Poirot. Now I’m&#160;a man who can take pretty good care of&#160;<br/>
himself.” From&#160;the pocket of his coat his hand brought a small automatic into sight for a&#160;<br/>moment. He&#160;continued grimly. “I don’t think I’m the kind of man to be caught napping. But, as I&#160;<br/>look at it, I might as well make assurance doubly&#160;sure. I fancy you’re the man for my money,&#160;<br/>Mr. Poirot. And remember—<i>big</i>&#160;money.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked at him&#160;thoughtfully for some&#160;minutes. His face was completely expressionless.&#160;<br/>
The other could have had no clue as to&#160;what thoughts were passing in that mind.&#160;<br/>
“I regret, Monsieur,”&#160;he said at length, “that I cannot oblige you.”&#160;<br/>The other looked at him&#160;shrewdly. “Name your figure, then,” he said.&#160;<br/>Poirot shook his head.&#160;<br/>“You do not understand, Monsieur. I have been very fortunate in my&#160;profession. I have made&#160;<br/>
enough money to satisfy both my&#160;needs and my&#160;caprices. I take now only such cases as—interest&#160;<br/>me.”&#160;<br/>
“You’ve got a pretty good nerve,” said Ratchett. “Will twenty thousand dollars tempt you?”&#160;<br/>“It will not.”&#160;<br/>“If you’re holding out for more, you won’t get it. I know what a thing’s worth to me.”&#160;<br/>“I, also, M. Ratchett.”&#160;<br/>“What’s wrong with my&#160;proposition?”&#160;<br/>Poirot rose.&#160;“If you will forgive me&#160;for being personal—I do not&#160;like your face, M. Ratchett,”&#160;<br/>
he said.&#160;<br/>
And with that he left the restaurant car.&#160;<br/>

<b>A CRY IN THE NIGHT&#160;</b><br/>
The Simplon Orient Express arrived at Belgrade at&#160;a quarter to nine that evening. It was not due&#160;<br/>to depart again until 9.15, so Poirot descended to&#160;the platform. He did not, however, remain there&#160;<br/>long. The cold was bitter, and though the platform&#160;itself was protected,&#160;heavy snow&#160;was falling&#160;<br/>outside. He returned to his compartment. The&#160;conductor, who was on the platform&#160;stamping his&#160;<br/>feet and waving his arms&#160;to keep warm, spoke to him.&#160;<br/>
“Your valises have been moved, Monsieur. To&#160;the compartment No. 1, the compartment of&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc.”&#160;<br/>
“But where is Monsieur Bouc, then?”&#160;<br/>“He has moved into the coach from&#160;Athens which has just been put on.”&#160;<br/>Poirot went in search of his friend. M.&#160;Bouc waved his protestations aside.&#160;<br/>“It is nothing. It is nothing. It&#160;is more convenient like this. You are going through to England,&#160;<br/>
so it is better that you should stay in the through coach to Calais. Me, I am&#160;very well here. It is&#160;<br/>most peaceful. This coach is empty save for myself and one little Greek&#160;doctor. Ah! my friend,&#160;<br/>what a night! They say there has not been so much&#160;snow for years. Let us hope we shall not be&#160;<br/>held up. I am not too happy about it, I can tell you.”&#160;<br/>
At 9.15 punctually the train pulled out of the station, and shortly afterwards Poirot got up, said&#160;<br/>
good night to his friend, and made his way along the&#160;corridor back into his own coach which was&#160;<br/>in front next to the dining-car.&#160;<br/>
On this, the second day of the journey, barriers were breaking down.&#160;Colonel Arbuthnot was&#160;<br/>
standing at the door of his compartment talking&#160;to MacQueen. When MacQueen saw Poirot he&#160;<br/>broke off something he was saying.&#160;He looked very much surprised.&#160;<br/>
“Why,” he cried, “I thought you’d left us. You said you were getting off at Belgrade.”&#160;<br/>“You misunderstood me,” said Poirot, smiling.&#160;“I remember now, the train started from&#160;<br/>
Stamboul just as we were talking about it.”&#160;<br/>
“But, man, your baggage. It’s gone.”&#160;<br/>“It has been moved into another compartment, that is all.”&#160;<br/>“Oh! I see.”&#160;<br/>He resumed his conversation with Arbuthnot,&#160;and Poirot passed on down the corridor.&#160;<br/>Two doors from&#160;his own compartment, the elderly American, Mrs. Hubbard, was standing&#160;<br/>
talking to the sheep-like lady, who was a Swede.&#160;Mrs. Hubbard was pressing a magazine on the&#160;<br/>other.&#160;<br/>
“No, do take it, my&#160;dear,” she said. “I’ve got plenty of other things to read. My, isn’t the cold&#160;<br/>
something frightful?” She&#160;nodded amicably to Poirot.&#160;<br/>
“You are most kind,” said the Swedish lady.&#160;<br/>“Not at all. I hope you’ll sleep well and that your head will be&#160;better in the morning.”&#160;<br/>“It is the cold only. I make&#160;now myself a cup of tea.”&#160;<br/>“Have you got some&#160;aspirin?&#160;Are you sure now?&#160;I’ve got plenty. Well, good night, my dear.”&#160;<br/>She turned to Poirot conversationally as the other woman departed.&#160;<br/>

“Poor creature, she’s a Swede. As far as I can&#160;make out she’s a kind of missionary. A teaching&#160;<br/>
one. A nice creature, but doesn’t&#160;talk much English. She was&#160;<i>most</i>&#160;interested in what I told her&#160;<br/>about my&#160;daughter.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot, by now, knew all about Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter. Everyone on&#160;the train who could&#160;<br/>
understand English did! How she and her husband were&#160;on the staff of a big American college in&#160;<br/>Smyrna, and how this was Mrs. Hubbard’s first journey to the East, and&#160;what she thought of the&#160;<br/>Turks and their slipshod ways and the condition of&#160;their roads.&#160;<br/>
The door next to them&#160;opened and the thin pale&#160;manservant stepped out. Inside, Poirot caught&#160;<br/>
a glimpse of Mr. Ratchett sitting up in bed. He saw Poirot and&#160;his face changed, darkening with&#160;<br/>anger. Then the door was shut.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard drew Poirot a little wide.&#160;<br/>“You know, I’m&#160;dead scared of that man. Oh! not&#160;the valet—the other. His master. Master,&#160;<br/>
indeed! There’s something&#160;<i>wrong</i>&#160;about that man. My daughter always says I’m&#160;very intuitive.&#160;<br/>‘When Mamma gets a hunch, she’s dead right,’ that’s what my daughter&#160;says. And I’ve got a&#160;<br/>hunch about that man. He’s next door to me&#160;and I don’t like it. I put my&#160;grips against the&#160;<br/>communicating door last night. I thought I heard him&#160;trying the handle. Duo you know, I&#160;<br/>shouldn’t be a bit surprised if that man turned out to be a murderer—one of these train robbers&#160;<br/>you read about. I daresay I’m&#160;foolish, but there it is. I’m&#160;absolutely&#160;scared to death of the man!&#160;<br/>My daughter said I’d have an easy journey, but&#160;somehow I don’t feel happy about it. It may be&#160;<br/>foolish, but I feel as if anything might happen—anything at all. And how that nice young fellow&#160;<br/>can bear to be his secretary, I can’t think.”&#160;<br/>
Colonel Arbuthnot and MacQueen were coming towards them&#160;down the corridor.&#160;<br/>“Come into my&#160;carriage,” MacQueen was saying. “It isn’t made up for the night yet. Now&#160;<br/>
what I want to get right about&#160;your policy in India is this—”&#160;<br/>
The two men passed and went on down the corridor to MacQueen’s carriage.&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard said good night to Poirot. “I&#160;guess I’ll go right to bed and read,” she said.&#160;<br/>
“Good night.”&#160;<br/>
“Good night, Madame.”&#160;<br/>Poirot passed into his own compartment,&#160;which was the next one beyond Ratchett’s. He&#160;<br/>
undressed and got into bed, read for about half an hour and then turned out the light.&#160;<br/>
He awoke some hours later, awoke with a start.&#160;He knew what it was&#160;that had wakened him—<br/>
a loud groan, almost a cry, somewhere close at hand. At the same&#160;moment the ting of a bell&#160;<br/>sounded sharply.&#160;<br/>
Poirot sat up and switched on the light. He noticed that the train was at a standstill—<br/>
presumably at a station.&#160;<br/>
That cry had startled him. He remembered that&#160;it was Ratchett who had the next compartment.&#160;<br/>
He got out of bed and opened the door just&#160;as the Wagon Lit conductor came&#160;hurrying along the&#160;<br/>corridor and knocked on Ratchett’s door. Poirot&#160;kept his door open a crack and watched. The&#160;<br/>conductor tapped a second time. A bell rang and a&#160;light showed over another door farther down.&#160;<br/>The conductor glanced over his shoulder. At the&#160;same moment a voice from&#160;within the next&#160;<br/>compartment called out: “<i>Ce n’est rien. Je me suis trompé</i>.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Bien, Monsieur</i>.” The conductor scurried off again, to&#160;knock at the door where the light was&#160;<br/>
showing.&#160;<br/>
Poirot returned to bed, his mind relieved, and switched off the light. He glanced at his watch.&#160;<br/>
It was just twenty-three minutes to one.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE CRIME&#160;</b><br/>
He found it difficult to go to sleep&#160;again at once. For&#160;one thing he missed the motion of the train.&#160;<br/>If&#160;it&#160;<i>was</i>&#160;a station outside, it was curiously quiet. By&#160;contrast the noises on the train seemed&#160;<br/>unusually loud. He could hear Ratchett moving about next door—a&#160;click as he pulled down the&#160;<br/>washbasin, the sound of the tap running, a splashing noise, then another click as the basin shut to&#160;<br/>again. Footsteps passed up the corridor outside, the shuffling footsteps of someone in bedroom&#160;<br/>slippers.&#160;<br/>
Hercule Poirot lay awake staring at&#160;the ceiling.&#160;Why was the station outside so silent?&#160;His&#160;<br/>
throat felt dry. He had forgotten to ask for his&#160;usual bottle of mineral water. He looked at his&#160;<br/>watch again. Just after a quarter&#160;past one. He would ring for&#160;the conductor and ask for some&#160;<br/>mineral water. His finger went out to the bell,&#160;but&#160;he paused as in the stillness&#160;he heard a ting.&#160;<br/>The man couldn’t answer every bell at once.&#160;<br/>
<i>Ting. ... Ting. ... Ting. ...&#160;<br/></i>It sounded again and again. Where was the man?&#160;Somebody was getting impatient.&#160;<br/><i>Ti-i-i-ing!&#160;<br/></i>Whoever it was, was keeping a finger solidly on the push-button.&#160;<br/>Suddenly with a rush, his footsteps echoing up the aisle, the&#160;man came. He knocked at a door&#160;<br/>
not far from&#160;Poirot’s own.&#160;<br/>
Then came voices—the conductor’s, deferential,&#160;apologetic; and a woman’s, insistent and&#160;<br/>
voluble.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard!&#160;<br/>Poirot smiled to himself.&#160;<br/>The altercation—if it was one—went on for&#160;some&#160;time. Its proportions were ninety per cent of&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard’s to a soothing ten per cent of the conductor’s. Finally the matter seemed to be&#160;<br/>adjusted. Poirot heard distinctly a “<i>Bonne nuit, Madame</i>,” and a closing door.&#160;<br/>
He pressed his own finger on the bell.&#160;<br/>The conductor arrived promptly. He looked hot and worried.&#160;<br/>“<i>De l’eau minérale, s’il vous Plaît</i>.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Bien, Monsieur</i>.” Perhaps a twinkle in Poirot’s&#160;eye led him&#160;to unburden himself. “<i>La dame&#160;</i><br/>
<i>américaine</i>—”&#160;<br/>
“Yes?”&#160;<br/>He wiped his forehead. “Imagine to yourself&#160;the time I have had with&#160;her! She insists—but&#160;<br/>
<i>insists</i>—that there is a man in her compartment! Figure to yourself, Monsieur. In a space of this&#160;<br/>size.” He swept a hand round. “Where would he conceal himself?&#160;I argue with her. I point&#160;out&#160;<br/>that it is impossible. She insists. She woke up, and there was a man there. And how, I ask, did he&#160;<br/>get out and leave the door bolted behind him?&#160;But she will&#160;not listen to reason. As though there&#160;<br/>were not enough to worry us already. This snow—”&#160;<br/>
“Snow?”&#160;<br/>“But yes, Monsieur. Monsieur has not noticed?&#160;The train has stopped. We&#160;have run into a&#160;<br/>
snowdrift. Heaven knows how long we shall be here. I remember once being snowed up for&#160;<br/>seven days.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=24></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Where are we?”&#160;<br/>“Between Vincovci and Brod.”&#160;<br/>“Là-là,” said Poirot vexedly.&#160;<br/>The man withdrew and returned with&#160;the water.&#160;<br/>“<i>Bon soir, Monsieur</i>.”&#160;<br/>Poirot drank a glass of water&#160;and composed himself to sleep.&#160;<br/>He was just dropping off when something again woke him. This time it was as though&#160;<br/>
something heavy had fallen&#160;with a thud against the door.&#160;<br/>
He sprang up, opened it and looked out. Nothing. But to his right, some&#160;distance down the&#160;<br/>
corridor, a woman wrapped in a scarlet kimono was retreating from&#160;him. At the other end, sitting&#160;<br/>on his little&#160;seat, the conductor was entering up figures on large&#160;sheets of paper. Everything was&#160;<br/>deathly quiet.&#160;<br/>
“Decidedly I suffer from the nerves,” said Poirot&#160;and retired to bed again. This time he slept&#160;<br/>
till morning.&#160;<br/>
When he awoke the train was still at a standstill. He raised a blind and looked out. Heavy&#160;<br/>
banks of snow surrounded the train.&#160;<br/>
He glanced at his watch and saw&#160;that it was past nine o’clock.&#160;<br/>At a quarter to ten, neat, spruce&#160;and dandified as ever, he made&#160;his way to the restaurant car,&#160;<br/>
where a chorus of woe was going on.&#160;<br/>
Any barriers there might have been between&#160;the passengers had now quite broken down. All&#160;<br/>
were united by a common misfortune. Mrs. Hubbard was loudest in her lamentations.&#160;<br/>
“My daughter said it would be the&#160;easiest way in the world. Just&#160;sit in the train until I got to&#160;<br/>
Parrus. And now we may be here for days and&#160;days,” she wailed. “And my boat sails day after&#160;<br/>to-morrow. How am&#160;I going to catch it now?&#160;Why,&#160;I can’t even wire to cancel my&#160;passage. I’m&#160;<br/>just too mad to talk about it!”&#160;<br/>
The Italian said that he had urgent&#160;business himself&#160;in Milan. The large American said that&#160;<br/>
that was “too bad, Ma’am,” and soothingly expressed a hope that the train might make&#160;up time.&#160;<br/>
“My sister—her children wait me,” said the Swedish lady, and wept. “I&#160;get no word to them.&#160;<br/>
What they think?&#160;They will say bad things have&#160;happen to me.”&#160;<br/>
“How long shall we be here?”&#160;demanded Mary Debenham. “Doesn’t anybody&#160;<i>know</i>?”&#160;<br/>Her voice sounded impatient, but Poirot noted that&#160;there were no signs of&#160;that almost feverish&#160;<br/>
anxiety which she had displayed during&#160;the check to the Taurus Express.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard was off again.&#160;<br/>“There isn’t anybody knows a thing on this train. And nobody’s trying to&#160;<i>do</i>&#160;anything. Just a&#160;<br/>
pack of useless foreigners. Why, if&#160;this were at home, there’d be someone at least&#160;<i>trying</i>&#160;to&#160;do&#160;<br/>something!”&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot turned to Poirot and spoke in careful British French.&#160;<br/>“<i>Vous êtes un directeur de la ligne, je&#160;crois, Monsieur. Vous pouvez nous dire</i>—”&#160;<br/>Smiling, Poirot corrected him.&#160;<br/>“No, no,” he said in English. “It is not I.&#160;You confound me&#160;with my friend, M. Bouc.”&#160;<br/>“Oh, I’m&#160;sorry”&#160;<br/>“Not at all. It is most natural. I am&#160;now in the compartment that he had formerly.”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc was not present in the restaurant car. Poirot looked about&#160;to notice who else was&#160;<br/>
absent.&#160;<br/>
Princess Dragomiroff was missing, and the Hungarian couple. Also Ratchett, his valet, and&#160;<br/>
the German lady’s-maid.&#160;<br/>

The Swedish lady wiped her eyes.&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;foolish,” she said. “I am&#160;bad to&#160;cry. All is for the best, whatever happen.”&#160;<br/>This Christian spirit, however, was far from&#160;being shared.&#160;<br/>“That’s all very well,” said MacQueen&#160;restlessly. “We may be here for days.”&#160;<br/>“What&#160;<i>is</i>&#160;this country anyway?”&#160;demanded Mrs. Hubbard tearfully.&#160;<br/>On being told it was Jugo-Slavia, she said: “Oh! one of these Balkan things. What can you&#160;<br/>
expect?”&#160;<br/>
“You are the only patient one, Mademoiselle,” said Poirot&#160;to&#160;Miss Debenham.&#160;<br/>She shrugged her shoulders slightly. “What can one do?”&#160;<br/>“You are a philosopher, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“That implies a detached&#160;attitude. I think my&#160;attitude is more selfish. I have learned to save&#160;<br/>
myself useless emotion.”&#160;<br/>
She was speaking more to herself than to him.&#160;She was not even looking at him. Her gaze&#160;<br/>
went past him, out of the window to&#160;where the snow lay in heavy masses.&#160;<br/>
“You are a strong character, Mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “You are, I think, the&#160;<br/>
strongest character amongst us.”&#160;<br/>
“Oh! no. No, indeed. I know one far, far stronger than I am.”&#160;<br/>“And that is—?”&#160;<br/>She seemed suddenly to come to herself, to&#160;realise that she was talking to a stranger and&#160;<br/>
foreigner, with whom, until this morning, she&#160;had exchanged&#160;only half a dozen sentences.&#160;<br/>
She laughed, a polite but estranging laugh.&#160;<br/>“Well—that old lady, for instance. You have probably noticed her. A very ugly old lady but&#160;<br/>
rather fascinating. She has only to&#160;lift a little finger and ask for something in a polite voice—and&#160;<br/>the whole train runs.”&#160;<br/>
“It runs also&#160;for my&#160;friend M. Bouc,” said Poirot. “But that is because&#160;he&#160;is a director of the&#160;<br/>
line, not because he has a strong character.”&#160;<br/>
Mary Debenham&#160;smiled.&#160;<br/>The morning wore away. Several people, Poirot&#160;amongst them, remained in the dining-car.&#160;<br/>
The communal life was felt, at the moment, to&#160;pass the time better. He heard a good deal more&#160;<br/>about Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter, and he heard the lifelong habits&#160;of Mr. Hubbard, deceased, from&#160;<br/>his rising in the morning and commencing breakfast with a cereal to his final rest at night in the&#160;<br/>bed-socks that Mrs. Hubbard herself had&#160;been in the habit of knitting for him.&#160;<br/>
It was when he was listening to&#160;a confused account of the missionary aims of the Swedish&#160;<br/>
lady that one of the Wagon Lit conductors&#160;came&#160;into the car and stood at his elbow.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Pardon, Monsieur</i>.”&#160;<br/>“Yes?”&#160;<br/>“The compliments of M. Bouc, and he would be&#160;glad if you would be so kind as to come&#160;to&#160;<br/>
him&#160;for a few minutes.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot rose, uttered excuses to the Swedish lady&#160;and followed the man out of the dining-car. It&#160;<br/>
was not his own conductor,&#160;but a big fair man.&#160;<br/>
He followed his guide down the corridor of his own carriage and along&#160;the corridor&#160;of the&#160;<br/>
next one. The man tapped at a door, then&#160;stood aside to let Poirot enter.&#160;<br/>
The compartment was not M. Bouc’s own. It&#160;was a second-class one—chosen presumably&#160;<br/>
because of its slightly larger size. It certainly gave&#160;the impression of being crowded.&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc himself was sitting on the small seat&#160;in the opposite corner. In the corner next the&#160;<br/>
window, facing him, was a small dark man looking out at the snow. Standing up and quite&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
25<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=26></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
preventing Poirot from&#160;advancing any farther were a big man in blue uniform&#160;(the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>)&#160;<br/>and his own Wagon Lit conductor.&#160;<br/>
“Ah! my good friend,” cried M. Bouc. “Come in. We&#160;have need of you.”&#160;<br/>The little man in the window shifted along the seat, and Poirot squeezed past: the other two&#160;<br/>
men and sat down facing his friend.&#160;<br/>
The expression on M. Bouc’s face gave him,&#160;as he&#160;would have expressed it, furiously to think.&#160;<br/>
It was clear that something out&#160;of the common had happened.&#160;<br/>
“What has occurred?”&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>“You may well ask that. First this&#160;snow-this stoppage. And now—”&#160;<br/>He paused—and a sort of strangled gasp came from&#160;the Wagon Lit conductor.&#160;<br/>“And now what?”&#160;<br/>“<i>And now a passenger lies dead in his berth—stabbed</i>.”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc spoke with a kind of calm&#160;desperation.&#160;<br/>“A passenger?&#160;Which passenger?”&#160;<br/>“An American. A man called—called—” he consulted some&#160;notes in front of him. “Ratchett.&#160;<br/>
That is right—Ratchett?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, Monsieur,” the Wagon Lit man gulped.&#160;<br/>Poirot looked at him. He&#160;was as white as chalk.&#160;<br/>“You had better let that man sit down,”&#160;he said. “He may faint otherwise.”&#160;<br/>The&#160;<i>chef de train&#160;</i>moved slightly and the Wagon Lit man sank down in the corner and buried&#160;<br/>
his face in his hands.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Brr</i>!” said Poirot. “This is serious!”&#160;<br/>“Certainly it is serious. To begin with, a murder—that in itself&#160;is a calamity of&#160;the first water.&#160;<br/>
But not only that, the circumstances are unusual. Here we are, brought to a standstill. We may be&#160;<br/>here for hours—and not only hours—days!&#160;Another circumstance—passing through most&#160;<br/>countries we&#160;have the police of that country on the train. But in&#160;Jugo-Slavia, no. You&#160;<br/>comprehend?”&#160;<br/>
“It is a position of great&#160;difficulty,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>“There is worse to come. Dr. Constantine—I forgot, I have not introduced you. Dr.&#160;<br/>
Constantine, M. Poirot.”&#160;<br/>
The little dark man bowed, and Poirot returned the bow.&#160;<br/>“Dr. Constantine is of&#160;the opinion that death occurred at about 1 A.M.”&#160;<br/>“It is difficult to speak&#160;exactly&#160;in these matters,” said the&#160;doctor, “but I think I&#160;can say&#160;<br/>
definitely that death occurred between midnight and two in the morning.”&#160;<br/>
“When was this M. Ratchett last&#160;seen alive?” asked Poirot.&#160;<br/>“He is known to have been alive at about twenty minutes to one, when he spoke to the&#160;<br/>
conductor,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>
“That is quite correct,” said Poirot. “I myself heard what passed.&#160;That is&#160;the last thing&#160;<br/>
known?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes.”&#160;<br/>Poirot turned toward the doctor, who continued.&#160;<br/>“The window of M. Ratchett’s compartment was found wide open, leading one to suppose&#160;<br/>
that the murderer escaped that way. But in&#160;my opinion that open window is a blind. Anyone&#160;<br/>departing that way would have left distinct traces in the snow. There were none.”&#160;<br/>
“The crime was discovered—when?” asked Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Michel!”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

The Wagon Lit conductor sat up. His face still looked pale and&#160;frightened.&#160;<br/>“Tell this gentleman exactly what occurred,” ordered M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>The man spoke somewhat jerkily.&#160;<br/>“The valet of this M. Ratchett, he tapped several times at the door this morning. There was no&#160;<br/>
answer. Then, half an hour ago, the restaurant&#160;car attendant came. He wanted to know if&#160;<br/>Monsieur was taking&#160;<i>déjeuner</i>. It was eleven o’clock, you comprehend.&#160;<br/>
“I open the door for him&#160;with my&#160;key. But there is a chain, too, and that is fastened. There is&#160;<br/>
no answer and it is very still in there, and&#160;cold—but cold. With the window open and snow&#160;<br/>drifting in. I thought the gentleman had had a fit, perhaps. I got the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>. We broke the&#160;<br/>chain and went in. He was—<i>Ah! c’était terrible</i>!”&#160;<br/>
He buried his face in his hands again.&#160;<br/>“The door was locked and chained on the inside,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “It was not&#160;<br/>
suicide—eh?”&#160;<br/>
The Greek doctor gave a sardonic laugh. “Does a man who commits suicide stab himself in&#160;<br/>
ten—twelve—fifteen places?”&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>
Poirot’s eyes opened. “That is&#160;great ferocity,” he said.&#160;<br/>“It is a&#160;woman,” said the&#160;<i>chef de&#160;train</i>, speaking for the first time.&#160;“Depend upon it, it was a&#160;<br/>
woman. Only a woman would stab like that.”&#160;<br/>
Dr. Constantine screwed up his face thoughtfully.&#160;<br/>“She must have been a very&#160;strong woman,” he said. “It&#160;is not my desire to speak&#160;<br/>
technically—that is only&#160;confusing; but I can assure you that one or&#160;two of the blows were&#160;<br/>delivered with such force as to drive them&#160;through hard belts of bone and muscle.”&#160;<br/>
“It was clearly not a scientific crime,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>“It was most unscientific,” returned Dr. Constantine. “The blows seem&#160;to have been delivered&#160;<br/>
haphazard&#160;and at random. Some&#160;have glanced off, doing hardly&#160;any damage. It is as though&#160;<br/>somebody had shut his eyes and then in a&#160;frenzy struck blindly again and again.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>C’est une femme</i>,” said&#160;the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>&#160;again.&#160;“Women are like that.&#160;When they&#160;are enraged&#160;<br/>
they have great strength.” He nodded so sagely&#160;that everyone suspected&#160;a personal experience of&#160;<br/>his own.&#160;<br/>
“I have, perhaps, something to contribute&#160;to your store of knowledge,” said Poirot. “M.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett spoke to me&#160;yesterday. He told me, as&#160;far as I was able to understand him, that he was&#160;<br/>in danger of his life.”&#160;<br/>
“ ‘Bumped off’—that is the American expression, is it not?” asked M. Bouc. “Then it is not a&#160;<br/>
woman. It is a ‘gangster’ or a ‘gunman.’ ”&#160;<br/>
The&#160;<i>chef de train</i>&#160;looked pained at seeing&#160;his theory come&#160;to nought.&#160;<br/>“If so,” said Poirot, “it seems to have been&#160;done very amateurishly.” His tone expressed&#160;<br/>
professional disapproval.&#160;<br/>
“There is a large American on the train,.”&#160;said M. Bouc, pursuing his idea. “A common-<br/>
looking man with terrible clothes. He chews the&#160;gum,&#160;which I believe is not done in good circles.&#160;<br/>You know whom&#160;I mean?”&#160;<br/>
The Wagon Lit conductor to whom&#160;he had appealed nodded.&#160;<br/>“<i>Oui, Monsieur</i>, the No. 16. But it cannot have been he. I should have seen him&#160;enter or leave&#160;<br/>
the compartment.”&#160;<br/>
“You might not. You might not. But we will go into&#160;that presently. The question is,&#160;what to&#160;<br/>
do?” He looked at Poirot.&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked back at him.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“Come, my&#160;friend,” said M.&#160;Bouc. “You comprehend what I am&#160;about to ask of you. I know&#160;<br/>
your powers. Take command of this investigation! No, no, do not refuse. See, to us it is&#160;<br/>serious—I speak for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits. By the time the Jugo-<br/>Slavian police arrive, how simple if we&#160;can present them&#160;with the solution! Otherwise delays,&#160;<br/>annoyances,&#160;a million and one inconveniences.&#160;Perhaps, who knows, serious annoyance to&#160;<br/>innocent persons. Instead—<i>you</i>&#160;solve the mystery! We say, ‘A murder has occurred—<i>this</i>&#160;is the&#160;<br/>criminal!’”&#160;<br/>
“And suppose I do not solve it?”&#160;<br/>“Ah,&#160;&#160;<i>mon cher</i>!” M. Bouc’s voice became positively caressing. “I know your reputation. I&#160;<br/>
know something of your methods. This is the ideal case for you. To look up the antecedents of&#160;<br/>all these people, to discover their&#160;<i>bona fides</i>—all that takes time&#160;and&#160;endless inconvenience. But&#160;<br/>have I not heard you say often that to solve a case a man has only to lie back in his chair and&#160;<br/>think?&#160;Do that. Interview the passengers on the train, view the body, examine what clues there&#160;<br/>are, and then—well, I have faith in you! I am&#160;assured that it is no idle boast of yours. Lie back&#160;<br/>and think—use (as I have heard you say so often) the little grey&#160;cells&#160;of&#160;the mind—and you will&#160;<br/><i>know</i>!”&#160;<br/>
He leaned forward, looking affectionately at the detective.&#160;<br/>“Your faith touches me, my friend,” said Poirot emotionally. “As you&#160;say, this cannot be a&#160;<br/>
difficult case. I myself last night—but we will&#160;not speak of that now. In truth, this problem&#160;<br/>intrigues me. I was reflecting, not half an hour ago, that many hours of boredom&#160;lay ahead whilst&#160;<br/>we are stuck here. And now—a problem&#160;lies ready to my&#160;hand.”&#160;<br/>
“You accept then?” said M. Bouc eagerly.&#160;<br/>“<i>C’est entendu</i>. You place the matter in my&#160;hands.”&#160;<br/>“Good—we are all at your service.”&#160;<br/>“To begin with, I should like a plan of the Istanbul-Calais coach, with a note of the people&#160;<br/>
who occupied the several compartments, and I should also like to see their passports and their&#160;<br/>tickets.”&#160;<br/>
“Michel will get you those.”&#160;<br/>The Wagon Lit conductor left the compartment.&#160;<br/>“What other passengers are there on the train?” asked Poirot.&#160;<br/>“In this coach Dr. Constantine and I are the only travellers. In&#160;the coach from&#160;Bucharest is an&#160;<br/>
old gentleman with a lame&#160;leg. He is well known&#160;to the conductor. Beyond that are the ordinary&#160;<br/>carriages, but these do not concern us, since they were locked after dinner had been served last&#160;<br/>night. Forward of the Istanbul-Calais&#160;coach there is only the dining-car.”&#160;<br/>
“Then it seems,” said Poirot slowly, “as though we must look for our murderer in the&#160;<br/>
Istanbul-Calais coach.” He turned to the doctor. “That is what you were hinting, I think?”&#160;<br/>
The Greek nodded. “At half an hour after midnight we ran into the snowdrift. No one can&#160;<br/>
have left the train since then.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc said solemnly, “<i>The murderer is with us—on the train now</i>. ...”&#160;<br/>

<b>A WOMAN&#160;</b><br/>
“First of all,” said Poirot, “I&#160;should like a word or two with young Mr. MacQueen. He may be&#160;<br/>able to give us valuable information.”&#160;<br/>
“Certainly,” said M. Bouc. He turned&#160;to the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>. “Get Mr. MacQueen to come&#160;here.”&#160;<br/>The&#160;<i>chef de train</i>&#160;left the carriage.&#160;<br/>The conductor returned with a bundle of passports&#160;and tickets. M. Bouc took them&#160;from him.&#160;<br/>“Thank you, Michel. It would be&#160;best now, I think, if you were&#160;to go back to your post. We&#160;<br/>
will take your evidence formally later.”&#160;<br/>
“Very good, Monsieur,” said Michel, and in his turn left the carriage.&#160;<br/>“After we have seen young MacQueen,” said Poirot, “perhaps&#160;<i>M. le docteur&#160;</i>will come&#160;with&#160;<br/>
me to the dead man’s carriage.”&#160;<br/>
“Certainly.”&#160;<br/>“After we have finished there—”&#160;<br/>But at this moment the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>&#160;returned with Hector MacQueen.&#160;<br/>M. Bouc rose. “We are a little cramped here,” he said pleasantly. “Take my&#160;seat, Mr.&#160;<br/>
MacQueen. M. Poirot&#160;will sit opposite you—so.”&#160;<br/>
He turned&#160;to&#160;the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>. “Clear&#160;all the people out of&#160;the&#160;restaurant car,” he said, “and let&#160;<br/>
it be left free for M. Poirot. You&#160;will conduct your interviews there,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>?”&#160;<br/>
“It would be the most convenient, yes,” agreed Poirot.&#160;<br/>MacQueen had stood looking from one to the other, not quite following the rapid flow of&#160;<br/>
French.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Qu’est-ce qu’il y a</i>?”&#160;he began laboriously. “<i>Pourquoi</i>—?”&#160;<br/>With a vigorous gesture Poirot motioned him&#160;to&#160;the seat in the corner. He took it and began&#160;<br/>
once more.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Pourquoi</i>—?” Then checking himself and relapsing into his own tongue: “What’s up on the&#160;<br/>
train?&#160;Has anything happened?”&#160;<br/>
He looked from&#160;one man to another.&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded. “Exactly. Something has&#160;happened. Prepare yourself&#160;for a shock.&#160;<i>Your&#160;</i><br/>
<i>employer, M. Ratchett, is dead</i>!”&#160;<br/>
MacQueen’s mouth pursed itself into&#160;a whistle. Except that his eyes grew a shade brighter, he&#160;<br/>
showed no signs of shock or distress.&#160;<br/>
“So they got him&#160;after all,” he said.&#160;<br/>“What exactly do you mean by that phrase, Mr. MacQueen?”&#160;<br/>MacQueen hesitated.&#160;<br/>“You are assuming,” said Poirot, “that M. Ratchett was murdered?”&#160;<br/>“Wasn’t he?” This time MacQueen&#160;did show surprise. “Why, yes,” he said slowly.&#160;“That’s&#160;<br/>
just what I did think. Do you mean he just died in his sleep?&#160;Why, the&#160;old man was as tough as—<br/>as tough—”&#160;<br/>
He stopped, at a loss for a simile.&#160;<br/>“No, no,” said Poirot. “Your assumption was quite&#160;right. M. Ratchett&#160;was murdered. Stabbed.&#160;<br/>
But I should like to know why you were so sure it&#160;<i>was</i>&#160;murder, and not just—death.”&#160;<br/>

MacQueen hesitated. “I must get this clear,” he said. “Who&#160;exactly are you?&#160;And where do&#160;<br/>
you come in?”&#160;<br/>
“I represent the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.” Poirot paused, then added, “I am&#160;<br/>
a detective. My name&#160;is Hercule Poirot.”&#160;<br/>
If he expected an effect he did not get one.&#160;MacQueen said merely, “Oh! yes?” and waited for&#160;<br/>
him&#160;to go on.&#160;<br/>
“You know the name&#160;perhaps?”&#160;<br/>“Why, it does seem&#160;kind of familiar. Only I always thought it was a woman’s dressmaker.”&#160;<br/>Hercule Poirot looked at&#160;him&#160;with distaste. “It is&#160;incredible!” he said.&#160;<br/>“What’s incredible?”&#160;<br/>“Nothing. Let us advance with the matter in hand. I want you to tell me, M. MacQueen, all&#160;<br/>
that you know about the dead man.&#160;You were not related to him?”&#160;<br/>
“No. I am—was—his secretary.”&#160;<br/>“For how long have you held that post?”&#160;<br/>“Just over a year.”&#160;<br/>“Please give me&#160;all the information you can.”&#160;<br/>“Well, I met Mr. Ratchett just over&#160;a year ago when I was in Persia—”&#160;<br/>Poirot interrupted.&#160;<br/>“What were you doing there?’&#160;<br/>“I had come&#160;over from&#160;New York to look into&#160;an oil concession. I don’t suppose you want to&#160;<br/>
hear all about that. My&#160;friends&#160;and I had been let in rather badly over it. Mr. Ratchett was in&#160;the&#160;<br/>same hotel. He had just had a row with his secretary. He offered me the job and I took it. I was at&#160;<br/>a loose end and glad to find a well-paid job ready made, as it were.”&#160;<br/>
“And since then?”&#160;<br/>“We’ve travelled about. Mr. Ratchett wanted to see the world. He was hampered by knowing&#160;<br/>
no languages. I acted more as a courier than&#160;as a secretary. It&#160;was a pleasant life.”&#160;<br/>
“Now tell me as much as you can about your employer.”&#160;<br/>The young man shrugged his shoulders. A perplexed expression passed over his face.&#160;<br/>“That’s not so easy.”&#160;<br/>“What was his full name?”&#160;<br/>“Samuel Edward Ratchett.”&#160;<br/>“He was an American citizen?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“What part of America did he come from?”&#160;<br/>“I don’t know.”&#160;<br/>“Well, tell me&#160;what you do know.”&#160;<br/>“The actual truth is, Mr. Poirot, that I know nothing at all!&#160;Mr. Ratchett never spoke of&#160;<br/>
himself or of his life in America.”&#160;<br/>
“Why do you think that was?”&#160;<br/>“I don’t know. I imagined that he might be&#160;ashamed of his beginnings. Some&#160;men are.”&#160;<br/>“Does that strike you as&#160;a satisfactory solution?”&#160;<br/>“Frankly, it doesn’t.”&#160;<br/>“Has he any&#160;relatives?”&#160;<br/>“He never mentioned any.”&#160;<br/>Poirot pressed the point.&#160;<br/>“You must have formed&#160;<i>some</i>&#160;theory,&#160;Mr. MacQueen.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
30<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Well, Yes, I did. For one thing, I don’t believe&#160;Ratchett was his real name. I think he left&#160;<br/>
America definitely in order to escape someone&#160;or something. I think he was successful—until a&#160;<br/>few weeks ago.”&#160;<br/>
“And then?”&#160;<br/>“He began to get letters—threatening letters.”&#160;<br/>“Did you see them?”&#160;<br/>“Yes. It was my business to attend to his&#160;correspondence. The first&#160;letter came a fortnight&#160;<br/>
ago.”&#160;<br/>
“Were these letters destroyed?”&#160;<br/>“No, I think I’ve got a couple still in my files—one I know Ratchett tore up in a rage. Shall I&#160;<br/>
get them&#160;for you?”&#160;<br/>
“If you would be so good.”&#160;<br/>MacQueen left the compartment. He returned&#160;a few minutes later and laid down two sheets of&#160;<br/>
rather dirty notepaper before Poirot.&#160;<br/>
The first letter ran as follows:&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>Thought you’d double-cross us and get away with it, did you?&#160;Not on your life. We’re out&#160;</i><br/>
<i>to GET you, Ratchett, and we WILL get you!&#160;<br/></i>&#160;<br/>
There was no&#160;signature.&#160;<br/>With no comment beyond raised eyebrows,&#160;Poirot picked up the second letter.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<i>We’re going to take you for a ride, Ratchett. Some time soon. We’re going to GET you—</i><br/>
<i>see?&#160;<br/></i>&#160;<br/>Poirot laid the letter down.&#160;<br/>“The style is&#160;monotonous!” he said. “More so than the handwriting.”&#160;<br/>MacQueen stared at him.&#160;<br/>“You would not observe,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It requires the eye of one used to such&#160;<br/>
things. This letter was not written by one person, M.&#160;MacQueen. Two or more persons wrote it—<br/>each writing&#160;one letter of&#160;a word at a time. Also, the letters are printed. That makes the task of&#160;<br/>identifying the handwriting much&#160;more difficult.” He paused, then said: “Did you know that M.&#160;<br/>Ratchett had applied for help to me?”&#160;<br/>
“To&#160;<i>you</i>?”&#160;<br/>MacQueen’s astonished tone told Poirot quite certainly that&#160;the young man had not known of&#160;<br/>
it.&#160;<br/>
The detective nodded. “Yes. He was alarmed. Tell&#160;me, how did he act when he received the&#160;<br/>
first letter?”&#160;<br/>
MacQueen hesitated.&#160;<br/>“It’s difficult to say. He—he—passed it off&#160;with&#160;a laugh in that quiet way of his. But&#160;<br/>
somehow—” he gave a slight shiver—“I felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the&#160;<br/>quietness.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot nodded. Then he asked an unexpected question.&#160;<br/>“Mr. MacQueen, will you tell me, quite honestly, exactly how you regarded your employer?&#160;<br/>
Did you like him?”&#160;<br/>
Hector MacQueen took a moment or two before replying.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
31<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“No,” he said at last. “I did not.”&#160;<br/>“Why.”&#160;<br/>“I can’t exactly say. He was always quite pleasant in his manner.” He paused, then said: “I’ll&#160;<br/>
tell you the truth, Mr. Poirot. I&#160;disliked and distrusted him. He was, I am&#160;sure, a cruel and&#160;<br/>dangerous man. I must admit, though, that I have no reasons to advance for my opinion.”&#160;<br/>
“Thank you, Mr. MacQueen. One further question:&#160;when did you last see Mr. Ratchett alive?”&#160;<br/>“Last evening about—” he thought for a minute—“ten o’clock, I&#160;should say. I went into his&#160;<br/>
compartment to take down some&#160;memoranda from him.”&#160;<br/>
“On what subject?”&#160;<br/>“Some tiles and antique pottery&#160;that he bought in Persia. What&#160;had been delivered was not&#160;<br/>
what he had purchased. There has been a&#160;long, vexatious correspondence on the subject.”&#160;<br/>
“And that was the last time Mr. Ratchett was seen&#160;alive?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, I suppose so.”&#160;<br/>“Do you know when Mr. Ratchett received the last threatening letter?”&#160;<br/>“On the morning of the day we left Constantinople.”&#160;<br/>“There is one more question I must ask&#160;you, Mr. MacQueen. Were you on good terms with&#160;<br/>
your employer?”&#160;<br/>
The young man’s eyes twinkled suddenly.&#160;<br/>“This is where I’m&#160;supposed to go all goosefleshy down the back. In the words of a best&#160;<br/>
seller, ‘You’ve nothing on me.’ Ratchett and I were on perfectly good terms.”&#160;<br/>
“Perhaps, Mr. MacQueen, you will give me&#160;your full name&#160;and your address in America.”&#160;<br/>MacQueen gave his name—Hector&#160;Willard MacQueen—and&#160;an address&#160;in New York.&#160;<br/>Poirot leaned back against the cushions.&#160;<br/>“That is all for the present, Mr. MacQueen,” he&#160;said. “I should be obliged if you would keep&#160;<br/>
the matter of Mr. Ratchett’s death to yourself for a little time.”&#160;<br/>
“His valet, Masterman,&#160;will have to know.”&#160;<br/>“He probably knows already,” said Poirot drily.&#160;“If so, try to get him&#160;to hold his tongue.”&#160;<br/>“That oughtn’t to be difficult. He’s a Britisher and,&#160;as he calls it, he ‘keeps to himself.’ He has&#160;<br/>
a low opinion of Americans, and no opinion at all of any other nationality.”&#160;<br/>
“Thank you, Mr. MacQueen.”&#160;<br/>The American left the carriage.&#160;<br/>“Well?” demanded M. Bouc. “You believe what he says, this young man?”&#160;<br/>“He seems honest and straightforward. He did not&#160;pretend to any affection for his employer,&#160;<br/>
as he probably would have done had he been involved in any way. It is true, Mr. Ratchett did not&#160;<br/>tell him&#160;that he had tried to enlist my services&#160;and failed, but I do not think&#160;that that is&#160;really&#160;a&#160;<br/>suspicious circumstance. I fancy Mr. Ratchett&#160;was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on&#160;<br/>every possible occasion.”&#160;<br/>
“So you pronounce one person at least innocent of&#160;the crime,” said M. Bouc jovially.&#160;<br/>Poirot cast on him&#160;a look of reproach.&#160;<br/>“Me, I suspect everybody till the last minute,” he said. “All the same, I must admit that I&#160;<br/>
cannot see this sober, long-headed&#160;MacQueen losing his head and&#160;stabbing his victim&#160;twelve or&#160;<br/>fourteen times. It is not in accord with his psychology—not at all.”&#160;<br/>
“No,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully. “That is the&#160;act of a man driven almost crazy with a&#160;<br/>
frenzied hate—it suggests rather the Latin temperament. Or else it suggests, as our friend the&#160;<br/><i>chef de train</i>&#160;insisted—a woman.”&#160;<br/>

<b>7&#160;</b><br/>
<b>THE BODY&#160;</b><br/>
Followed by Dr. Constantine, Poirot made his&#160;way to the next coach&#160;and to&#160;the compartment&#160;<br/>occupied by the murdered man. The conductor&#160;came&#160;and unlocked the door for them with his&#160;<br/>key.&#160;<br/>
The two men passed inside. Poirot turned inquiringly to his companion.&#160;<br/>“How much has been disarranged in this compartment?”&#160;<br/>“Nothing has been touched. I was careful not&#160;to move the body in making my examination.”&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded. He looked round him.&#160;<br/>The first thing that struck the senses was&#160;the intense cold. The window was pushed down as&#160;<br/>
far as it would go, and the blind was drawn up.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Brrr</i>,” observed Poirot.&#160;<br/>The other smiled appreciatively.&#160;<br/>“I did not like to close it,” he said.&#160;<br/>Poirot examined the window carefully.&#160;<br/>“You are right,” he announced. “Nobody left the carriage this way. Possibly the open window&#160;<br/>
was intended to suggest that somebody did; but if&#160;so, the snow has defeated the murderer’s&#160;<br/>intention.”&#160;<br/>
He examined the frame of the window carefully. Taking a small case from&#160;his pocket he blew&#160;<br/>
a little powder over the frame.&#160;<br/>
“No fingerprints at all,” he said. “That means&#160;it: has been wiped. Well,&#160;if there had been&#160;<br/>
fingerprints they would have told&#160;us very little. They would have&#160;been those of Mr. Ratchett or&#160;<br/>his valet or the conductor. Criminals do not&#160;make&#160;mistakes of that kind nowadays.&#160;<br/>
“And that being so,”&#160;he added cheerfully, “we might&#160;as well shut the window. Positively it is&#160;<br/>
the cold storage in here!”&#160;<br/>
He suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the first time&#160;to the&#160;<br/>
motionless figure lying in the bunk.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett lay on his back. His pyjama jacket, stained with rusty patches, had been unbuttoned&#160;<br/>
and thrown back.&#160;<br/>
“I had to see the nature of the&#160;wounds, you see,” explained the doctor.&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded. He bent over the body. Finally he&#160;straightened himself with a slight grimace.&#160;<br/>“It is not pretty,” he said. “Someone must&#160;have stood there and stabbed him&#160;again and again.&#160;<br/>
How many wounds are there exactly?”&#160;<br/>
“I make it twelve. One or two are so slight as to&#160;be practically scratches. On the other hand, at&#160;<br/>
least three would be capable of causing death.”&#160;<br/>
Something in the doctor’s tone caught Poirot’s&#160;attention. He looked at&#160;him sharply. The little&#160;<br/>
Greek was standing staring down at&#160;the body with a puzzled frown.&#160;<br/>
“Something strikes you as odd, does it not?” he asked gently.&#160;“Speak, my friend. There is&#160;<br/>
something here that puzzles you?”&#160;<br/>
“You are right,” acknowledged the other.&#160;<br/>“What is it?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“You see these two wounds—here and here—” He&#160;pointed. “They are deep. Each cut must&#160;<br/>
have severed blood vessels—and yet the edges do&#160;not gape. They have not bled as one would&#160;<br/>have expected.”&#160;<br/>
“Which suggests?”&#160;<br/>“That the man was already dead—some little time dead—when they were delivered. But that&#160;<br/>
is surely absurd.”&#160;<br/>
“It would seem so,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Unless our murderer figured to himself that he&#160;<br/>
had not accomplished his job properly and came&#160;back&#160;to make quite sure—but that is manifestly&#160;<br/>absurd! Anything else?”&#160;<br/>
“Well, just one thing.”&#160;<br/>“And that?”&#160;<br/>“You see this wound here—under the right arm—near&#160;the right shoulder. Take this pencil of&#160;<br/>
mine. Could you deliver such a blow?”&#160;<br/>
Poirot poised his hand.&#160;<br/>“<i>Précisément</i>,” he said.&#160;“I see. With the&#160;<i>right</i>&#160;hand it is exceedingly difficult,&#160;almost&#160;<br/>
impossible. One would have to strike backhanded,&#160;as it were. But if&#160;the blow were struck with&#160;<br/>the&#160;<i>left</i>&#160;hand—”&#160;<br/>
“Exactly, M. Poirot. That blow was&#160;almost certainly struck with the&#160;<i>left</i>&#160;hand.”&#160;<br/>“So that our murderer is left-handed?&#160;No, it is more difficult than that, is it not?”&#160;<br/>“As you say, M. Poirot. Some&#160;of these other&#160;blows are just as obviously right-handed.”&#160;<br/>“Two people. We&#160;are back at two people again,”&#160;murmured the detective. He asked abruptly:&#160;<br/>
“Was the electric light on?”&#160;<br/>
“It is difficult to say. You see, it is turned off by the conductor every morning about ten&#160;<br/>
o’clock.”&#160;<br/>
“The switches will tell us,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>He examined the&#160;switch&#160;of&#160;the top light and&#160;also&#160;the roll-back bed-head light. The former was&#160;<br/>
turned off. The latter was&#160;closed.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Eh bien</i>,” he said thoughtfully. “We&#160;have here a hypothesis of&#160;the First and the Second&#160;<br/>
Murderer, as the great Shakespeare would put it. The First Murderer&#160;stabbed his victim&#160;and left&#160;<br/>the compartment, turning off the light. The Second Murderer came in in the dark, did not see that&#160;<br/>his or her work had been done, and stabbed at least twice at a dead body.&#160;<i>Que pensez-vous de&#160;<br/>ça</i>?”&#160;<br/>
“Magnificent!” said the little doctor with enthusiasm.&#160;<br/>The other’s eyes twinkled.&#160;<br/>“You think so?&#160;I am&#160;glad. It sounded&#160;to me a little like the nonsense.”&#160;<br/>“What other explanation can there be?”&#160;<br/>“That is just what I am&#160;asking myself. Have we&#160;here a coincidence, or&#160;what? Are there any&#160;<br/>
other inconsistencies, such as would&#160;point to two people being concerned?”&#160;<br/>
“I think I can say yes. Some&#160;of these blows,&#160;as I have already said, point to a weakness—a&#160;<br/>
lack of strength or a lack of determination. They are feeble, glancing blows. But this one here—<br/>and this one—” Again&#160;he pointed.&#160;“Great strength was needed for those blows. They have&#160;<br/>penetrated the muscle.”&#160;<br/>
“They were, in your opinion, delivered by a man?”&#160;<br/>“Most certainly.”&#160;<br/>“They could not have been delivered by a woman?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“A young, vigorous, athletic woman might have struck&#160;them, especially if&#160;she were in the grip&#160;<br/>
of a strong emotion; but it is in&#160;my opinion highly unlikely.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot was silent a moment or two.&#160;<br/>The other asked anxiously, “You understand my point?”&#160;<br/>“Perfectly,” said Poirot. “The&#160;matter begins to clear itself&#160;up wonderfully! The murderer was&#160;<br/>
a man of great strength—he was feeble—it was a woman—it was a right-handed person—it was&#160;<br/>a left-handed person.&#160;<i>Ah! c’est rigolo, tout ça</i>!” He spoke with sudden anger. “And the victim—<br/>what does he do in all this?&#160;Does he cry out?&#160;Does he struggle?&#160;Does&#160;he defend himself?”&#160;<br/>
He slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol&#160;which Ratchett had&#160;<br/>
shown him&#160;the day before.&#160;<br/>
“Fully loaded, you see,” he said.&#160;<br/>They looked round them. Ratchett’s day clothing was hanging from&#160;the hooks on the wall. On&#160;<br/>
the small table formed by the lid of&#160;the wash basin were various objects. False teeth in a glass of&#160;<br/>water. Another glass, empty. A bottle&#160;of mineral water. A large flask. An ash-tray containing the&#160;<br/>butt of a cigar and some&#160;charred fragments of paper; also two burnt matches.&#160;<br/>
The doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it.&#160;<br/>“Here is the explanation of the victim’s inertia,” he said quietly.&#160;<br/>“Drugged?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded. He picked up the two matches and scrutinised them&#160;carefully.&#160;<br/>“You have a clue then?”&#160;demanded the little doctor eagerly.&#160;<br/>“Those two matches are of different shapes,” said&#160;Poirot. “One is&#160;flatter&#160;than the other. You&#160;<br/>
see?”&#160;<br/>
“It is the kind you get on the train,”&#160;said the doctor. “In paper covers.”&#160;<br/>Poirot was feeling in the pockets of Ratchett’s clothing. Presently he pulled out a box of&#160;<br/>
matches. He compared them&#160;carefully with the burnt ones.&#160;<br/>
“The rounder one is a match struck by Mr. Ratchett,” he said. “Let us see if he had also the&#160;<br/>
flatter kind.”&#160;<br/>
But a further search showed no other matches.&#160;<br/>Poirot’s eyes were darting about&#160;the compartment. They were bright and sharp like a bird’s.&#160;<br/>
One felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny.&#160;<br/>
With a little exclamation&#160;he bent and picked-up something from&#160;the floor.&#160;<br/>It was a small square of cambric, very dainty.&#160;In the corner was an embroidered initial—H.&#160;<br/>“A woman’s&#160;handkerchief,” said&#160;the doctor. “Our friend the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>&#160;was right. There is a&#160;<br/>
woman concerned in this.”&#160;<br/>
“And most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said Poirot. “Exactly as it&#160;<br/>
happens in the books and on the films—and to make&#160;things even easier for us, it is marked with&#160;<br/>an initial.”&#160;<br/>
“What a stroke of luck for us!” exclaimed the doctor.&#160;<br/>“Is it not?” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>Something in his tone surprised the doctor, but&#160;before he could ask for elucidation Poirot had&#160;<br/>
made another dive onto the floor.&#160;<br/>
This time he held out on the palm&#160;of his hand—a pipe-cleaner.&#160;<br/>“It is perhaps the property of Mr. Ratchett?”&#160;suggested the doctor.&#160;<br/>“There was no pipe in any of his pockets, and no tobacco or&#160;tobacco pouch.”&#160;<br/>“Then it is a clue.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“Oh! decidedly. And again dropped most conveniently. A masculine clue, this time, you note!&#160;<br/>
One cannot complain of having no clues in this case. There are clues here in abundance. By the&#160;<br/>way, what have you done with the weapon?”&#160;<br/>
“There was no sign of any weapon. The murderer&#160;must have taken it away with him.”&#160;<br/>“I wonder why,” mused Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Ah!” The doctor had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of the dead man.&#160;<br/>“I overlooked this,” he said. “I unbuttoned&#160;the jacket and threw it straight back.”&#160;<br/>From&#160;the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch. The case&#160;was dented savagely, and the&#160;<br/>
hands pointed to a quarter past one.&#160;<br/>
“You see?” cried Constantine eagerly. “This gives us&#160;the hour of the crime. It agrees with my&#160;<br/>
calculations.&#160;Between midnight and&#160;two in the&#160;morning is&#160;what&#160;I said, and probably about one&#160;<br/>o’clock, though it is difficult to be exact in these matters.&#160;<i>Eh bien</i>, here is confirmation. A&#160;<br/>quarter past one. That was the hour of the crime.”&#160;<br/>
“It is possible, yes. It&#160;is certainly possible.”&#160;<br/>The doctor looked at him&#160;curiously. “You will&#160;pardon me, M. Poirot, but I do not quite&#160;<br/>
understand you.”&#160;<br/>
“I do not understand myself,” said Poirot. “I&#160;understand nothing at all. And, as you perceive,&#160;<br/>
it worries me.”&#160;<br/>
He sighed and bent over the little table examining the charred fragment of paper. He&#160;<br/>
murmured to himself, “What I need at this&#160;moment is an old-fashioned woman’s hat-box.”&#160;<br/>
Dr. Constantine was at a loss to know what to make&#160;of this singular remark. In any case Poirot&#160;<br/>
gave him&#160;no time for questions. Opening the door&#160;into the corridor, he&#160;called for the conductor.&#160;<br/>
The man arrived at a run.&#160;<br/>“How many women are there in this coach?”&#160;<br/>The conductor counted on his fingers.&#160;<br/>“One, two, three—six, Monsieur. The old American lady, a Swedish lady, the young English&#160;<br/>
lady, the Countess Andrenyi, and Madame&#160;la&#160;Princesse Dragomiroff and her maid.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot considered.&#160;<br/>“They all have hat-boxes, yes?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Then bring me—let me&#160;see—yes, the Swedish&#160;lady’s and that of the lady’s-maid. Those two&#160;<br/>
are the only hope. You will tell them it is&#160;a customs regulation—something—anything that&#160;<br/>occurs to you.”&#160;<br/>
“That will be all right, Monsieur. Neither&#160;lady is in her compartment at the moment.”&#160;<br/>“Then be quick.”&#160;<br/>The conductor departed. He returned with the two hatboxes. Poirot opened that of the maid,&#160;<br/>
and tossed&#160;it aside. Then he opened the&#160;Swedish lady’s and&#160;uttered an exclamation of&#160;<br/>satisfaction. Removing the hats carefully,&#160;he disclosed round humps of wire-netting.&#160;<br/>
“Ah, here is what we need! About fifteen&#160;years ago hat-boxes were made like this. You&#160;<br/>
skewered through the hat with a hatpin on to this&#160;hump&#160;of wire-netting.”&#160;<br/>
As he spoke he was skillfully removing two of&#160;the attached humps. Then&#160;he repacked the hat-<br/>
box and told the conductor to return both boxes where they belonged.&#160;<br/>
When the door was shut once more he turned to his companion.&#160;<br/>“See you, my dear doctor, me, I am&#160;not one to&#160;rely upon the expert procedure. It is the&#160;<br/>
psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash. But in this case I would welcome&#160;a&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

little scientific assistance. This compartment is full of&#160;clues, but can I be sure that&#160;those clues are&#160;<br/>really what they seem&#160;to be?”&#160;<br/>
“I do not quite understand you, M. Poirot.”&#160;<br/>“Well, to give you an example—we&#160;find a woman’s handkerchief. Did a woman drop it? Or&#160;<br/>
did a man, committing the crime, say to himself:&#160;‘I will make this look like a woman’s crime. I&#160;<br/>will stab my enemy an unnecessary number of&#160;times, making some&#160;of the blows feeble and&#160;<br/>ineffective,&#160;and I&#160;will drop this&#160;handkerchief where no one can miss it’?&#160;That is one possibility.&#160;<br/>Then there is another. Did a woman kill him, and did she deliberately drop a pipe-cleaner to&#160;<br/>make it look like a man’s work?&#160;Or are we seriously to suppose that two people, a man and a&#160;<br/>woman, were separately concerned,&#160;and that each&#160;was so careless as to drop&#160;a clue to his or her&#160;<br/>identity? It is a little too much of a coincidence, that!”&#160;<br/>
“But where does the hat-box come&#160;in?”&#160;asked the doctor, still puzzled.&#160;<br/>“Ah! I am coming to that. As I say, these clues—the watch stopped at a quarter past one, the&#160;<br/>
handkerchief, the pipe-cleaner—they may be genuine, or they may be faked. As to that I cannot&#160;<br/>yet tell. But there is one clue&#160;here which—though again I may be&#160;wrong—I believe has not been&#160;<br/>faked. I mean this flat match,&#160;<i>M. le docteur. I believe that&#160;that&#160;match was used by the murderer,&#160;<br/>not by Mr. Ratchett</i>. It was used to burn an incriminating&#160;paper of some&#160;kind. Possibly a note. If&#160;<br/>so, there was something&#160;in that note,&#160;some mistake,&#160;some error, that&#160;left&#160;a possible clue to the&#160;<br/>assailant. I am going to try to discover what that something was.”&#160;<br/>
He went out of the compartment and returned&#160;a&#160;few moments later with a small spirit stove&#160;<br/>
and a pair of curling-tongs.&#160;<br/>
“I use them&#160;for the moustaches,”&#160;he said, referring to the latter.&#160;<br/>The doctor watched him&#160;with great&#160;interest.&#160;Poirot flattened out the two humps of wire, and&#160;<br/>
with great care wriggled&#160;the charred&#160;scrap of paper on to one of them. He&#160;clapped the other on&#160;<br/>top of it and then, holding both pieces together&#160;with the tongs, held the whole thing over the&#160;<br/>flame of the spirit-lamp.&#160;<br/>
“It is a very makeshift affair, this,” he said over his shoulder. “Let us hope that it will answer&#160;<br/>
our purpose.”&#160;<br/>
The doctor watched the proceedings attentively.&#160;The metal began to glow. Suddenly he saw&#160;<br/>
faint indications of letters. Words formed themselves slowly-words of fire.&#160;<br/>
It was a very tiny scrap. Only three words and part of another showed.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
<i>—member little Daisy Armstrong&#160;</i><br/>
&#160;<br/>“Ah!” Poirot gave a sharp exclamation.&#160;<br/>“It tells you something?” asked the doctor.&#160;<br/>Poirot’s eyes were shining. He&#160;laid down the tongs carefully.&#160;<br/>“Yes,” he said. “<i>I know the dead man’s real name. I know why he had to leave America</i>.”&#160;<br/>“What was his name?”&#160;<br/>“Cassetti.”&#160;<br/>“Cassetti?” Constantine knitted his brows. “It brings&#160;back to me&#160;something. Some years ago. I&#160;<br/>
cannot remember. ... It was a case in America, was it not?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes,” said Poirot. “A case in America.”&#160;<br/>Further than that Poirot was&#160;not disposed to be communicative. He looked round him&#160;as he&#160;<br/>
went on:&#160;<br/>

“We will go&#160;into&#160;all that presently.&#160;Let us first make sure that we have&#160;seen all there is to&#160;be&#160;<br/>
seen here.”&#160;<br/>
Quickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead man’s clothes but&#160;<br/>
found nothing there of interest. He tried the communicating door which led through to the next&#160;<br/>compartment, but it was&#160;bolted on the other side.&#160;<br/>
“There is one thing that I do not understand,” said Dr. Constantine.&#160;“If the murderer did not&#160;<br/>
escape through the window, and if this communicating door was bolted on the other side, and if&#160;<br/>the door into the corridor was not only locked&#160;on the inside but chained, how then did the&#160;<br/>murderer leave the compartment?”&#160;<br/>
“That is what the audience says when a person bound hand and foot is&#160;shut into a cabinet—<br/>
and disappears.”&#160;<br/>
“You mean—?”&#160;<br/>“I mean,” explained Poirot, “that if the murderer&#160;intended us to believe&#160;that he had escaped by&#160;<br/>
way of the window, he would naturally make it appear that the other two&#160;exits were impossible.&#160;<br/>Like the ‘disappearing person’ in the cabinet, it&#160;is a trick. It is our business to find out how the&#160;<br/>trick is done.&#160;<br/>
He locked the communicating door on their side—“in case,” he said, “the excellent Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Hubbard should take it into her head to acquire&#160;first-hand details of the&#160;crime to write to her&#160;<br/>daughter.”&#160;<br/>
He looked round once more.&#160;<br/>“There is nothing more to do here,&#160;I think. Let us rejoin M. Bouc.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<b>8&#160;</b><br/>
<b>THE ARMSTRONG KIDNAPPING&#160;CASE&#160;</b><br/>
They found M. Bouc finishing an omelet.&#160;<br/>
“I thought it best to have lunch served immediately in the restaurant car,” he said.&#160;<br/>
“Afterwards it will be cleared and M. Poirot can&#160;conduct his examination of&#160;the passengers there.&#160;<br/>In the meantime I have ordered them&#160;to bring us three some food here.”&#160;<br/>
“An excellent idea,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>None of the three men was hungry, and the meal was soon eaten; but not till they were sipping&#160;<br/>
their coffee did M. Bouc mention the subject that was occupying all their minds.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Eh bien</i>?”&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>“<i>Eh bien</i>, I have discovered the identity&#160;of the victim. I know why it was imperative he should&#160;<br/>
leave America.”&#160;<br/>
“Who was he?”&#160;<br/>“Do you remember reading of the Armstrong baby?&#160;This is the man who murdered little&#160;<br/>
Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti.”&#160;<br/>
“I recall it now. A shocking affair—though I cannot remember the details.”&#160;<br/>“Colonel Armstrong was an Englishman—a V.C.&#160;He was half American, his mother having&#160;<br/>
been a daughter of W.&#160;K. Van der Halt, the Wall&#160;Street millionaire. He married the daughter of&#160;<br/>Linda Arden, the most famous tragic American&#160;actress of her day. They lived in America and&#160;<br/>had one child—a girl whom&#160;they idolized. When&#160;she was three years old she was kidnapped, and&#160;<br/>an impossibly high sum&#160;demanded as the price of&#160;her return. I will not&#160;weary you with all the&#160;<br/>intricacies&#160;that followed. I will come to the moment when, after the parents&#160;had paid over the&#160;<br/>enormous sum&#160;of two hundred thousand dollars,&#160;the child’s dead body was discovered; it had&#160;<br/>been dead for at least a fortnight. Public indignation rose to fever point. And there was worse to&#160;<br/>follow. Mrs. Armstrong was expecting another&#160;baby. Following the shock of the discovery, she&#160;<br/>gave birth prematurely to a dead&#160;child, and herself died. Her&#160;broken-hearted husband shot&#160;<br/>himself.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Mon Dieu</i>, what a tragedy. I remember now,” said M.&#160;Bouc. “There was also another death,&#160;<br/>
if I remember rightly?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, an unfortunate French or Swiss nursemaid. The police were convinced that she had&#160;<br/>
some&#160;knowledge of the crime. They refused to believe her hysterical denials. Finally, in a fit of&#160;<br/>despair the poor girl threw herself from&#160;a window and was killed.&#160;It was proved afterwards that&#160;<br/>she had been&#160;absolutely innocent of&#160;any complicity in the crime.”&#160;<br/>
“It is not good to think of,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“About six months later, this man Cassetti was arrested as the head of the gang who had&#160;<br/>
kidnapped the child. They had used the same&#160;methods&#160;in the past. If the police seemed likely to&#160;<br/>get on their trail, they&#160;killed their prisoner, hid the body, and&#160;continued to extract as much money&#160;<br/>as possible before the crime was discovered.&#160;<br/>
“Now, I will make clear to you this,&#160;my&#160;friend. Cassetti was&#160;the man! But by means of the&#160;<br/>
enormous wealth he had piled up, and owing to the secret hold he had over various persons, he&#160;<br/>was acquitted on some&#160;technical inaccuracy. Notwithstanding that, he would have been lynched&#160;<br/>by the populace had he not been clever enough to&#160;give them&#160;the slip. It is now clear to&#160;me what&#160;<br/>

happened. He changed his name&#160;and left America. Since then he has been a&#160;gentleman of leisure,&#160;<br/>travelling abroad and living on his&#160;<i>rentes</i>.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Ah! quel animal</i>!” M. Bouc’s tone was redolent of heartfelt disgust. “I cannot regret that he&#160;<br/>
is dead—not at all!”&#160;<br/>
“I agree with you.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Tout de même</i>, it is not necessary that he should be&#160;killed on the Orient Express. There are&#160;<br/>
other places.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot smiled a little. He realised that&#160;M. Bouc was biased in the matter.&#160;<br/>“The question we have now to ask ourselves is&#160;this,” he said. “Is this&#160;murder the&#160;work of&#160;<br/>
some&#160;rival gang whom Cassetti had double-crossed&#160;in the past, or is it an act of private&#160;<br/>vengeance?”&#160;<br/>
He explained his discovery of the few words on the charred fragment of paper.&#160;<br/>“If I am&#160;right in&#160;my&#160;assumption, then, the letter was burnt by the murderer.&#160;Why?&#160;Because it&#160;<br/>
mentioned the name ‘Armstrong,’ which is the clue to the mystery.”&#160;<br/>
“Are there any members of&#160;the Armstrong family living?”&#160;<br/>“That, unfortunately, I do not know. I think I remember reading of a younger sister of Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Armstrong’s.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot went on to relate the joint conclusions&#160;of himself and Dr. Constantine. M. Bouc&#160;<br/>
brightened at the mention of the broken watch.&#160;<br/>
“That seems to give us the time of the crime very&#160;exactly.”&#160;<br/>“Yes,” said Poirot. “It is very convenient.”&#160;<br/>There was an indescribable something in his tone that made both the other two look at him&#160;<br/>
curiously.&#160;<br/>
“You say that you yourself heard Ratchett speak to the conductor&#160;at twenty minutes to one?”&#160;<br/>
asked M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>
Poirot related just what had occurred.&#160;<br/>“Well,” said M. Bouc, “that proves at least that&#160;Cassetti—or&#160;Ratchett, as&#160;I shall continue to&#160;<br/>
call him—was certainly alive at twenty minutes to one.”&#160;<br/>
“Twenty-three minutes to one, to be precise.”&#160;<br/>‘Then at twelve thirty-seven, to&#160;put it formally, Mr. Ratchett was&#160;alive.&#160;That is&#160;<i>one</i>&#160;fact, at&#160;<br/>
least.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot did not reply. He sat looking thoughtfully in front of him.&#160;<br/>There was a tap on the door and the restaurant attendant entered.&#160;<br/>“The restaurant car is free now, Monsieur,” he said.&#160;<br/>“We will go&#160;there,” said M. Bouc, rising.&#160;<br/>“I may accompany you?” asked Constantine.&#160;<br/>“Certainly, my dear doctor. Unless M. Poirot has any objection?”&#160;<br/>“Not at all. Not at all,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>After a little politeness&#160;in the matter of precedence—“<i>Après vous, Monsieur</i>”—“<i>Mais non,&#160;</i><br/>
<i>après vous</i>”—they left the compartment.&#160;<br/>

<i><b>THE EVIDENCE&#160;</b></i><br/>
<b>1&#160;</b><br/>
<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE WAGON LIT CONDUCTOR&#160;</b><br/>
In the restaurant car all was in readiness.&#160;<br/>
Poirot and M. Bouc sat together on one side of a table. The doctor sat across the aisle.&#160;<br/>On the table in front of Poirot was a plan of&#160;the Istanbul-Calais coach with the&#160;names of&#160;the&#160;<br/>
passengers marked in red ink. The passports and tickets were in a pile&#160;at one side. There was&#160;<br/>writing paper, ink, pen, and pencils.&#160;<br/>
“Excellent,” said Poirot. “We can open our Court of Inquiry without more ado. First, I think,&#160;<br/>
we should take the evidence of the Wagon Lit&#160;conductor. You probably know something about&#160;<br/>the man. What character has he?&#160;Is he a&#160;man on whose word you would place reliance?”&#160;<br/>
“I should say so, most assuredly.&#160;Pierre Michel has been&#160;employed by the company for over&#160;<br/>
fifteen years. He is a Frenchman—lives near&#160;Calais. Thoroughly respectable and honest. Not,&#160;<br/>perhaps, remarkable for brains.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot nodded comprehendingly. “Good,”&#160;he said. “Let us see him.”&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>Pierre Michel had recovered some&#160;of his assurance, but he was still extremely nervous.&#160;<br/>“I hope Monsieur will not think that there has been any negligence on my part,” he said&#160;<br/>
anxiously, his eyes going from&#160;Poirot to M. Bouc. “It is a terrible thing&#160;that has happened. I hope&#160;<br/>Monsieur does not think that&#160;it reflects on me&#160;in any way?”&#160;<br/>
Having soothed the man’s fears, Poirot began his questions. He first elicited Michel’s name&#160;<br/>
and address, his length of service, and the length of time he had&#160;been on this particular route.&#160;<br/>These particulars he already knew,&#160;but the routine questions served&#160;to put the man at his ease.&#160;<br/>
“And now,”&#160;went on Poirot, “let us come&#160;to the&#160;events of&#160;Last night. M.&#160;Ratchett retired to&#160;<br/>
bed—when?”&#160;<br/>
“Almost immediately after dinner, Monsieur. Actually before we left Belgrade. So he did on&#160;<br/>
the previous night. He had directed me&#160;to make&#160;up the bed while he was at&#160;dinner, and I did so.”&#160;<br/>
“Did anybody go into his compartment afterwards?”&#160;<br/>“His valet, Monsieur,&#160;and the young American gentleman, his secretary.”&#160;<br/>“Anyone else?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur, not that I know of.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=43></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Good. And that is the last&#160;you saw or heard of him?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur. You forget he rang his bell about twenty to one—soon after we had stopped.”&#160;<br/>“What happened exactly?”&#160;<br/>“I knocked at the door, but he called out&#160;and said he had made&#160;a mistake.”&#160;<br/>“In English or in French?”&#160;<br/>“In French.”&#160;<br/>“What were his words exactly?”&#160;<br/>“<i>Ce n’est rien. Je me suis trompé</i>.”&#160;<br/>“Quite right,” said Poirot. “That is&#160;what I heard. And then you went away?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Did you go back to your seat?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur, I went first to answer&#160;another bell that had just rung.”&#160;<br/>“Now, Michel, I am&#160;going to ask you an important question. Where were you at a quarter past&#160;<br/>
one?’&#160;<br/>
“I, Monsieur?&#160;I was at my little seat at the end—facing up the corridor.”&#160;<br/>“You are sure?”&#160;<br/>“<i>Mais oui</i>—at least—”&#160;<br/>“I went into the next coach,&#160;the Athens coach, to speak to&#160;my colleague there. We spoke&#160;<br/>
about the snow. That was at some&#160;time&#160;soon after one o’clock. I cannot say exactly.”&#160;<br/>
“And you returned—when?”&#160;<br/>“One of my&#160;bells rang, Monsieur—I remember—I told you. It was the American lady. She&#160;<br/>
had rung several times.”&#160;<br/>
“I recollect,”&#160;said Poirot. “And after that?”&#160;<br/>“After that, Monsieur? I answered your bell&#160;and brought you some&#160;mineral water. Then, about&#160;<br/>
half an hour later, I made up the bed in one&#160;of the other compartments—that of the young&#160;<br/>American gentleman, Mr. Ratchett’s secretary.”&#160;<br/>
“Was Mr. MacQueen alone in his compartment when you went to make up his bed?”&#160;<br/>“The English Colonel from&#160;No. 15 was with him. They had been sitting&#160;talking.”&#160;<br/>“What did the Colonel do when he left Mr. MacQueen?”&#160;<br/>“He went back to his own compartment.”&#160;<br/>“No. 15—that is quite close&#160;to your seat, is it not?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur, it is the second compartment from that end of the corridor.”&#160;<br/>“His bed was already made up?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur. I had made it up while he was at dinner.”&#160;<br/>“What time was all this?”&#160;<br/>“I could not say exactly, Monsieur. Not later than two o’clock certainly.”&#160;<br/>“And after that?”&#160;<br/>“After that, Monsieur, I sat&#160;in my&#160;seat till morning.”&#160;<br/>“You did not go again into the Athens coach?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Perhaps you slept?”&#160;<br/>“I do not think so, Monsieur. The&#160;train being at a standstill prevented me&#160;from&#160;dozing off as I&#160;<br/>
usually do.”&#160;<br/>
“Did you see any of the passengers&#160;moving up or down the corridor?”&#160;<br/>The man reflected. “One of the ladies went&#160;to the toilet at&#160;the far end, I think.”&#160;<br/>“Which lady?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
43<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=44></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“I do not know, Monsieur. It was far down the corridor and she&#160;had her back to me. She had&#160;<br/>
on a kimono of scarlet with dragons on it.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot nodded. “And after that?”&#160;<br/>“Nothing, Monsieur, until the morning.”&#160;<br/>“You are sure?”&#160;<br/>“Ah, pardon—you yourself, Monsieur, opened your door and looked out for a second.”&#160;<br/>“Good, my friend,” said Poirot. “I wondered whether you would remember that. By the way, I&#160;<br/>
was awakened by what sounded like something heavy falling against my door. Have you any&#160;<br/>idea what that could have been?”&#160;<br/>
The man stared at him.&#160;“There was nothing, Monsieur. Nothing, I am&#160;positive of it.”&#160;<br/>“Then I must&#160;have had the&#160;<i>cauchemar</i>,” said Poirot philosophically.&#160;<br/>“Unless,” put in M. Bouc, “it&#160;was something in the compartment next door that you heard.”&#160;<br/>Poirot took no notice of the suggestion. Perhaps he did not wish to before the Wagon Lit&#160;<br/>
conductor.&#160;<br/>
“Let us pass to another point,” he said. “Supposing that last night an assassin joined the train.&#160;<br/>
Is it quite certain that&#160;he could not have left it after committing the crime?”&#160;<br/>
Pierre Michel shook his head.&#160;<br/>“Nor that he&#160;can be concealed on it somewhere?”&#160;<br/>“It has been well searched,” said M.&#160;Bouc. “Abandon that idea, my friend.”&#160;<br/>“Besides,” said Michel, “no one could get on&#160;to the sleeping-car without my seeing them.”&#160;<br/>“When was the last stop?”&#160;<br/>“Vincovci.”&#160;<br/>“What time was that?”&#160;<br/>“We should have left there at 11:58, but owing to the weather we&#160;were twenty minutes late.”&#160;<br/>“Someone might have come along from&#160;the ordinary part of&#160;the train?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur. After the service&#160;of dinner, the door&#160;between the ordinary&#160;carriages and the&#160;<br/>
sleeping-cars is locked.”&#160;<br/>
“Did you yourself descend from&#160;the train at Vincovci?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur. I got down onto the platform&#160;as&#160;usual and stood by the step up into the train.&#160;<br/>
The other conductors did the same.”&#160;<br/>
“What about the forward door—the&#160;one near the restaurant car?”&#160;<br/>“It is always fastened on the inside.”&#160;<br/>“It is not so fastened now.”&#160;<br/>The man looked surprised; then his face cleared. “Doubtless one of&#160;the passengers opened it&#160;<br/>
to look out on the snow.”&#160;<br/>
“Probably,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>He tapped thoughtfully on the table for a minute or two.&#160;<br/>“Monsieur does not blame me?”&#160;said the man timidly.&#160;<br/>Poirot smiled on him&#160;kindly.&#160;<br/>“You have had the evil chance, my friend,” he said. “Ah! one other point while I remember it.&#160;<br/>
You said that another bell rang just as you were&#160;knocking at M. Ratchett’s&#160;door. In fact I heard it&#160;<br/>myself Whose was it?”&#160;<br/>
“It was the bell of&#160;Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff. She desired me&#160;to summon her maid.”&#160;<br/>“And you did so?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>Poirot studied the plan in front of him thoughtfully. Then he inclined his head.&#160;<br/>

“That is all,” he said, “for the moment.”&#160;<br/>“Thank you, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>The man rose. He looked at M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Do not distress yourself,” said the latter kindly; “I cannot see that there has been any&#160;<br/>
negligence on your part.”&#160;<br/>
Gratified, Pierre Michel&#160;left&#160;the compartment.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE SECRETARY&#160;</b><br/>
For a minute or two Poirot remained lost, in thought.&#160;<br/>
“I think,” he said at last, “that it would be well to have a further word with Mr. MacQueen, in&#160;<br/>
view of what&#160;we now know.”&#160;<br/>
The young American appeared promptly.&#160;<br/>“Well,” he said, “how are things going?”&#160;<br/>“Not too badly. Since our last&#160;conversation, I have learnt something—the identity of Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett.”&#160;<br/>
Hector MacQueen leaned forward&#160;interestedly. “Yes?”&#160;he said.&#160;<br/>“ ‘Ratchett,’ as you suspected, was merely an alias. The man ‘Ratchett’ was Cassetti, who ran&#160;<br/>
the celebrated kidnapping&#160;stunts—including the&#160;famous affair of little Daisy Armstrong.”&#160;<br/>
An expression of utter astonishment appeared&#160;on MacQueen’s face. Then it darkened. “The&#160;<br/>
damned skunk!” he exclaimed.&#160;<br/>
“You had no idea of this, Mr. MacQueen?”&#160;<br/>“No, sir,” said the young American decidedly. “If&#160;I had, I’d have cut off my right hand before&#160;<br/>
it had a chance to do secretarial work for him!”&#160;<br/>
“You feel strongly about the matter, Mr. MacQueen?”&#160;<br/>“I have a particular reason for&#160;doing so. My father was the district attorney who handled the&#160;<br/>
case, Mr. Poirot. I saw Mrs. Armstrong more than&#160;once—she was a lovely woman. So gentle and&#160;<br/>heartbroken.” His face darkened. “If ever a man&#160;deserved what he got, Ratchett—or Cassetti—is&#160;<br/>the man. I’m rejoiced at his end. Such a man wasn’t fit to live!”&#160;<br/>
“You almost feel as though you would have&#160;been willing to do&#160;the good deed yourself?”&#160;<br/>“I do. I—” He paused, then added rather guiltily, “Seems I’m kind of incriminating myself.”&#160;<br/>“I should be more inclined to suspect you, Mr. MacQueen, if you displayed an inordinate&#160;<br/>
sorrow at your employer’s decease.”&#160;<br/>
“I don’t think I could do that even to save myself from&#160;the chair,” said MacQueen grimly.&#160;<br/>
Then he added: “If I’m&#160;not being unduly curious, just how&#160;did you figure this out?&#160;Cassetti’s&#160;<br/>identity, I mean.”&#160;<br/>
“By a fragment of a letter found in his compartment.”&#160;<br/>“But surely—I mean—that was rather careless of the old man?”&#160;<br/>“That depends,” said Poirot, “on the point of view.”&#160;<br/>The young man seemed to find this remark rather&#160;baffling. He stared&#160;at Poirot as though&#160;<br/>
trying to make him&#160;out.&#160;<br/>
“The task before me,” said Poirot, “is to make sure of the movements of every one on the&#160;<br/>
train. No offence need be taken, you understand. It is only a matter of routine.”&#160;<br/>
“Sure. Get right on with it and let&#160;me&#160;clear my&#160;character if I can.”&#160;<br/>“I need hardly ask you the number of your compartment,” said Poirot, smiling, “since I shared&#160;<br/>
it with you&#160;for a&#160;night.&#160;It&#160;is&#160;the&#160;second-class&#160;compartment Nos. 6 and 7, and after my departure&#160;<br/>you had it to yourself.”&#160;<br/>
“That’s right.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=47></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Now, Mr. MacQueen, I want you to describe&#160;your movements last night from the time of&#160;<br/>
leaving the dining-car.”&#160;<br/>
“That’s quite easy. I went back to my compartment, read a bit, got out on the&#160;platform&#160;at&#160;<br/>
Belgrade, decided it was too cold, and got in again. I talked for a while to a young English lady&#160;<br/>who is in the compartment next to mine. Then&#160;I fell into conversation&#160;with that Englishman,&#160;<br/>Colonel Arbuthnot—as a matter of fact I think you passed us as we&#160;were talking. Then I went in&#160;<br/>to Mr. Ratchett and, as I told you, took down some&#160;memoranda of letters he wanted written. I&#160;<br/>said good tight to him&#160;and left him. Colonel Arbuthnot was still standing in the corridor. His&#160;<br/>compartment was already made up&#160;for the night, so I suggested&#160;that he should come along to&#160;<br/>mine. I ordered a couple of drinks and we got right down to it. Discussed world politics and the&#160;<br/>Government&#160;of India and our own&#160;troubles with Prohibition and the Wall&#160;Street crisis. I don’t as&#160;<br/>a rule cotton to Britishers—they’re a stiff-necked lot—but I liked this one.”&#160;<br/>
“Do you know what time it was when he left you?”&#160;<br/>“Pretty late. Nearly two o’clock, I should say.”&#160;<br/>“You noticed that the train had stopped?”&#160;<br/>‘Oh, yes. We wondered a bit. Looked out and saw the snow lying very&#160;thick, but we didn’t&#160;<br/>
think it was serious.”&#160;<br/>
“What happened when Colonel Arbuthnot finally said good night?”&#160;<br/>“He went along to his compartment and I called to the conductor to make&#160;up my bed.”&#160;<br/>“Where were you whilst he was making it?”&#160;<br/>“Standing just outside the door in&#160;the corridor smoking a cigarette.”&#160;<br/>“And then?”&#160;<br/>“And then I went to bed&#160;and slept till morning.”&#160;<br/>“During the evening did you&#160;leave the train at all?”&#160;<br/>“Arbuthnot and I thought we’d get out at—what was the name&#160;of the place?—Vincovci—to&#160;<br/>
stretch our legs a bit. But it was bitterly&#160;cold—a blizzard on. We soon hopped back again.”&#160;<br/>
“By which door did you leave the train?”&#160;<br/>“By the one nearest to our compartment.”&#160;<br/>“The one next to the dining-car?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“Do you remember if it was bolted?”&#160;<br/>MacQueen considered.&#160;<br/>“Why, yes, I seem&#160;to remember it&#160;was. At least there was a kind of&#160;bar that fitted across the&#160;<br/>
handle. Is that what you mean?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes. On getting back into the&#160;train did you replace that bar?”&#160;<br/>“Why, no—I don’t think I did. I got in last. No, I don’t seem&#160;to remember doing so.” He&#160;<br/>
added suddenly, “Is that an important point?”&#160;<br/>
“It may be. Now, I presume, Monsieur, that&#160;while you and Colonel Arbuthnot were sitting&#160;<br/>
talking the door of your compartment into the corridor was open?”&#160;<br/>
Hector MacQueen nodded.&#160;<br/>“I want you, if you can, to tell me&#160;if&#160;anyone passed along that corridor&#160;<i>after</i>&#160;the train left&#160;<br/>
Vincovci up to the time you parted company for the night.”&#160;<br/>
MacQueen drew his brows together.&#160;<br/>“I think the conductor passed along once,” he said, “coming from&#160;the direction of the dining-<br/>
car. And a woman passed the other way, going towards it.”&#160;<br/>
“Which woman?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=48></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“I couldn’t say. I didn’t really&#160;notice. You see I was arguing&#160;a&#160;point with Arbuthnot. I just&#160;<br/>
seem&#160;to remember a glimpse of some&#160;scarlet&#160;silk affair passing the&#160;door. I didn’t look, and&#160;<br/>anyway I wouldn’t have seen the person’s face.&#160;As you know, my carriage faces the dining-car&#160;<br/>end of the train, so a woman going along the corridor&#160;in that direction would&#160;have her back to me&#160;<br/>as soon as she’d passed.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot nodded. “She was going&#160;to the toilet, I presume?”&#160;<br/>“I suppose so.”&#160;<br/>“And you saw her return?”&#160;<br/>“Well, no, now that you mention it, I didn’t notice her returning but I suppose she must have&#160;<br/>
done so.”&#160;<br/>
“One more question. Do you smoke a pipe, Mr. MacQueen?”&#160;<br/>“No, sir, I do not.”&#160;<br/>Poirot paused a moment. “I think that is all at&#160;present. I should&#160;now like to see the valet of&#160;Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett. By the way, did both you and&#160;he always travel second-class?”&#160;<br/>
“He did. But I usually went first—if&#160;possible in the compartment adjoining Mr.&#160;Ratchett’s.&#160;<br/>
Then he had most of his baggage put in my&#160;compartment and yet could get at both it and me&#160;<br/>easily whenever he chose. But on this occasion&#160;all the first-class berths were booked except the&#160;<br/>one that he took.”&#160;<br/>
“I comprehend. Thank you, Mr. MacQueen.”&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE VALET&#160;</b><br/>
The American was succeeded by the pale Englishman with the inexpressive face whom&#160;Poirot&#160;<br/>had already noticed on the day before. He stood&#160;waiting very correctly. Poirot motioned to him&#160;<br/>to sit down.&#160;<br/>
“You are, I understand, the valet of M. Ratchett.”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Your name?”&#160;<br/>“Edward Henry Masterman.”&#160;<br/>“Your age?”&#160;<br/>“Thirty-nine.”&#160;<br/>“And your home&#160;address?”&#160;<br/>“21 Friar Street, Clerkenwell.”&#160;<br/>“You have heard that your master has been murdered?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir. A very shocking occurrence.”&#160;<br/>“Will you now tell me, please, at what hour you&#160;last saw M. Ratchett?”&#160;<br/>The valet considered.&#160;<br/>“It must have been about nine o’clock, sir, last night. That&#160;or a little after.”&#160;<br/>“Tell me&#160;in your own words exactly what happened.”&#160;<br/>“I went in to Mr. Ratchett as usual, sir, and attended to his wants.”&#160;<br/>“What were your duties exactly?”&#160;<br/>“To fold or hang up his clothes,&#160;sir, put his dental plate in&#160;water and see that he had&#160;<br/>
everything he wanted for the night.”&#160;<br/>
“Was his manner much the same&#160;as usual?”&#160;<br/>The valet considered a moment.&#160;<br/>“Well, sir, I think he was upset.”&#160;<br/>“In what way—upset?”&#160;<br/>“Over a letter he’d&#160;been reading. He asked me&#160;if it was I who had put it in his compartment.&#160;<br/>
Of course I told him&#160;I hadn’t done any such thing, but he swore at me and found fault with&#160;<br/>everything I did.”&#160;<br/>
“Was that unusual?”&#160;<br/>“Oh, no, sir. He lost his temper easily—as I say,&#160;it just depended what&#160;had happened to upset&#160;<br/>
him.”&#160;<br/>
“Did your master ever take a sleeping draught?”&#160;<br/>Dr. Constantine leaned forward a little.&#160;<br/>“Always when travelling&#160;by&#160;train, sir. He said he&#160;couldn’t sleep otherwise.”&#160;<br/>“Do you know what drug he was in the habit of taking?”&#160;<br/>“I couldn’t say, I’m&#160;sure,&#160;sir.&#160;There was no name&#160;on the bottle—just ‘<i>The Sleeping Draught to&#160;</i><br/>
<i>be taken at bedtime</i>.’ ”&#160;<br/>
“Did he take it last night?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir. I poured it into&#160;a glass and put it on top of the&#160;toilet table ready for him.”&#160;<br/>“You didn’t actually see him&#160;drink it?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“No, sir.”&#160;<br/>“What happened next?”&#160;<br/>“I asked if there was anything further, and also&#160;asked what time&#160;he would like to be called in&#160;<br/>
the morning. He said he didn’t want&#160;to be disturbed till he rang.”&#160;<br/>
“Was that usual?”&#160;<br/>“Quite usual, sir. When he was ready to get up&#160;he used to ring the bell for the conductor and&#160;<br/>
then send him for me.”&#160;<br/>
“Was he usually an early or a late riser?”&#160;<br/>“It depended, sir, on his mood. Sometimes he’d&#160;get up for breakfast, sometimes he wouldn’t&#160;<br/>
get up till just on lunch time.”&#160;<br/>
“So that you weren’t alarmed when the morning wore on and no summons came?”&#160;<br/>“No, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Did you know that your master had enemies?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir.” The man spoke quite unemotionally.&#160;<br/>“How did you know?”&#160;<br/>“I had heard him&#160;discussing some&#160;letters, sir, with Mr. MacQueen.”&#160;<br/>“Had you an affection for your employer, Masterman?”&#160;<br/>Masterman’s face became, if possible, even&#160;more inexpressive than it was normally.&#160;<br/>“I should hardly like to say that,&#160;sir. He was a generous employer.”&#160;<br/>“But you didn’t like him?”&#160;<br/>“Shall we put it that I don’t care&#160;very much for Americans,&#160;sir?”&#160;<br/>“Have you ever been in America?”&#160;<br/>“No, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Do you remember reading in the paper of the Armstrong kidnapping case?”&#160;<br/>A little colour came into the man’s cheeks.&#160;<br/>“Yes, indeed, sir. A little baby girl,&#160;wasn’t it?&#160;A very shocking affair.”&#160;<br/>“Did you know that your employer, Mr. Ratchett, was the principal instigator in that affair?”&#160;<br/>“No, indeed, sir.” The valet’s tone held positive&#160;warmth and feeling for the first time. “I can&#160;<br/>
hardly believe it, sir.”&#160;<br/>
“Nevertheless, it is true. Now, to pass to your&#160;own movements last night. A matter of routine,&#160;<br/>
you understand. What did you do after leaving your master?”&#160;<br/>
“I told Mr. MacQueen, sir, that the master wanted him.&#160;Then&#160;I went to my own compartment&#160;<br/>
and read.”&#160;<br/>
“Your compartment was—”&#160;<br/>“The end second-class one, sir. Next to the dining-car.”&#160;<br/>Poirot was looking at his plan.&#160;<br/>“I see—and you had which berth?”&#160;<br/>“The lower one, sir.”&#160;<br/>“That is No. 4?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Is there anyone in with you?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir. A big Italian fellow.”&#160;<br/>“Does he speak English?”&#160;<br/>“Well, a kind of English, sir.” The valet’s&#160;tone was deprecating. “He’s been in America—<br/>
Chicago, I understand.”&#160;<br/>
“Do you and he talk together much?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“No, sir. I prefer to read.”&#160;<br/>Poirot smiled. He could visualize the scene—the&#160;large, voluble Italian,&#160;and the snub direct&#160;<br/>
administered by the gentleman’s gentleman.&#160;<br/>
“And what, may I ask, are you reading?” he inquired.&#160;<br/>“At present, sir, I am&#160;reading&#160;<i>Love’s Captive</i>, by Mrs. Arabella Richardson.”&#160;<br/>“A good story?”&#160;<br/>“I find it highly enjoyable, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Well, let us continue. You returned to your compartment and read&#160;<i>Love’s Captive&#160;</i>till—<br/>
when?”&#160;<br/>
“At about ten thirty, sir, this Italian wanted&#160;to go to bed. So the conductor came and made the&#160;<br/>
beds up.”&#160;<br/>
“And then you went to bed and to sleep?”&#160;<br/>“I went to bed, sir, but I didn’t sleep.”&#160;<br/>“Why didn’t you sleep?”&#160;<br/>“I had the toothache, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Oh, là-là—that is painful.”&#160;<br/>“Most painful, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Did you do anything for it?”&#160;<br/>“I applied a little oil of&#160;cloves, sir, which relieved&#160;the pain a little, but I was still not able to&#160;<br/>
get to&#160;sleep.&#160;I turned the&#160;light&#160;on above my head and continued to&#160;read—to take my mind off, as&#160;<br/>it were.”&#160;<br/>
“And did you not go to sleep at all?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir, I dropped off about&#160;four in the morning.”&#160;<br/>“And your companion?”&#160;<br/>“The Italian fellow?&#160;Oh, he just snored.”&#160;<br/>“He did not leave the compartment at all during the night?”&#160;<br/>“No, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Did you?”&#160;<br/>“No, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Did you hear anything during the night?”&#160;<br/>“I don’t think so, sir. Nothing unusual, I mean. The train being at a standstill made it all very&#160;<br/>
quiet.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot was silent a moment or two. Then he spoke.&#160;<br/>“Well, I think there is very&#160;little more to be said. You cannot throw any light upon the&#160;<br/>
tragedy?”&#160;<br/>
“I’m&#160;afraid not. I’m&#160;sorry, sir.”&#160;<br/>“As far as you know, was there&#160;any quarrel or bad blood between your master and Mr.&#160;<br/>
MacQueen?”&#160;<br/>
“Oh! no, sir. Mr. MacQueen was a very pleasant gentleman.”&#160;<br/>“Where were you in service before you came to Mr. Ratchett?”&#160;<br/>“With Sir Henry Tomlinson, sir, in Grosvenor Square.”&#160;<br/>“Why did you leave him?”&#160;<br/>“He was going to East Africa, sir,&#160;and did not require my services any longer. But I am&#160;sure&#160;<br/>
he will speak for me, sir. I was with him&#160;some years.”&#160;<br/>
“And you have been with Mr. Ratchett—how long?”&#160;<br/>“Just over nine months, sir.”&#160;<br/>

“Thank you, Masterman. By the way, are you a pipe-smoker?”&#160;<br/>“No, sir. I only smoke cigarettes—gaspers, sir.”&#160;<br/>“Thank you, that will do.”&#160;<br/>Poirot gave him&#160;a nod of dismissal.&#160;<br/>The valet hesitated a moment.&#160;<br/>“You’ll excuse me, sir, but the elderly American&#160;lady is in what I might describe as a state,&#160;<br/>
sir. She’s saying she knows all&#160;about the murderer. She’s in a&#160;very excitable condition, sir.”&#160;<br/>
“In that case,” said Poirot, smiling, “we had better see her next.”&#160;<br/>“Shall I tell her, sir? She’s been demanding to&#160;see someone in authority for a long time. The&#160;<br/>
conductor’s been trying to pacify her.”&#160;<br/>
“Send her to&#160;us, my&#160;friend,” said Poirot. “We will listen to her story now.”&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE AMERICAN LADY&#160;</b><br/>
Mrs. Hubbard arrived in the dining-car in such a state of breathless excitement that she was&#160;<br/>hardly able to articulate her words.&#160;<br/>
“Now just tell me&#160;this—who’s&#160;in authority here?&#160;I’ve got some&#160;very important information,&#160;<br/>
<i>very</i>&#160;important indeed, and I’m&#160;going to&#160;tell it to someone in authority just as soon as I can. If&#160;<br/>you gentlemen—”&#160;<br/>
Her wavering&#160;glance fluctuated between the three men. Poirot leaned forward.&#160;<br/>“Tell it to me, Madame,” he said.&#160;“But first, pray be seated.”&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard plumped heavily down on to the seat opposite to him.&#160;<br/>“What I’ve got to tell you is just&#160;this. There was a murder on the train last night,&#160;and the&#160;<br/>
murderer was&#160;<i>right there in my compartment</i>!”&#160;<br/>
She paused to give dramatic emphasis to her words.&#160;<br/>“You are sure of this, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“Of course I’m&#160;sure! The idea! I know what I’m&#160;talking about. I’ll tell you everything there is&#160;<br/>
to tell. I’d gotten into bed and gone to sleep, and suddenly I woke up—everything was dark—<br/>and I knew there was a man in my&#160;compartment. I&#160;was just so scared I couldn’t scream, if you&#160;<br/>know what I mean. I just lay there and thought, ‘Mercy, I’m&#160;going&#160;to be killed!’ I just can’t&#160;<br/>describe to you how I felt. These&#160;nasty trains, I thought, and all the outrages I’d&#160;read of. And I&#160;<br/>thought, ‘Well, anyway, he won’t get my jewellery’—because, you see, I’d put that in a stocking&#160;<br/>and hidden it under my&#160;pillow—which isn’t any too comfortable, by the way; kinda bumpy, if&#160;<br/>you know what I mean. But that’s neither here nor there. Where was I?”&#160;<br/>
“You realised, Madame, that there was a man in your compartment.”&#160;<br/>“Yes, well, I just lay there&#160;with my&#160;eyes closed, and wondered what I’d&#160;do. And I thought,&#160;<br/>
well, I’m&#160;just thankful that my&#160;daughter doesn’t know the plight I’m&#160;in. And then, somehow, I&#160;<br/>got my&#160;wits about me and I felt about with my&#160;hand and I pressed the bell for the conductor. I&#160;<br/>pressed it and I pressed it, but nothing happened—and I can tell you, I thought my&#160;heart was&#160;<br/>going to stop beating. ‘Mercy,’ I said to myself,&#160;‘maybe they’ve murdered every single soul on&#160;<br/>the train.’ It was at a standstill anyhow and there was a nasty quiet feel in the air. But I just&#160;went&#160;<br/>on pressing that bell and oh! the relief when I heard footsteps coming running down the corridor&#160;<br/>and a knock on the door! ‘Come in,’&#160;I screamed, and I switched on&#160;the lights at the same&#160;time.&#160;<br/>And would you believe it, there wasn’t a&#160;<i>soul</i>&#160;there!”&#160;<br/>
This seemed to Mrs. Hubbard to be a dramatic climax rather than an anticlimax.&#160;<br/>“And what happened next, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“Why, I told the man what had happened and he&#160;didn’t seem&#160;to believe me. Seemed to&#160;<br/>
imagine I’d dreamed the whole thing. I made&#160;him&#160;look under the seat, though he said there&#160;<br/>wasn’t room&#160;for a man to squeeze himself in there. It was plain enough that the man had got&#160;<br/>away—but there&#160;<i>had</i>&#160;been a man there, and it just made&#160;me mad the way the conductor tried to&#160;<br/>soothe me down! I’m&#160;not one to imagine&#160;things, Mr.—I don’t think I know your name?”&#160;<br/>
“Poirot, Madame; and this is M. Bouc, a director of the company, and Dr. Constantine.”&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard murmured, “Pleased to meet you, I’m&#160;sure,” to all three of them&#160;in an&#160;<br/>
abstracted manner and then plunged once more into her recital.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“Now I’m&#160;just not going to pretend I was as bright as I might have&#160;been. I got it into my head&#160;<br/>
that it was the man from&#160;next door—the poor fellow who’s been killed. I&#160;told the conductor to&#160;<br/>look at the door between the compartments, and&#160;sure enough it wasn’t bolted. Well, I soon saw&#160;<br/>to that. I told him to bolt it then and there, and after he’d gone out I got up and put a suitcase&#160;<br/>against it to make sure.”&#160;<br/>
“What time was this, Mrs. Hubbard?”&#160;<br/>“Well, I’m&#160;sure I can’t tell you. I never looked to see. I was so upset.”&#160;<br/>“And what is your theory now?”&#160;<br/>“Why, I should say it was just as plain as plain could be. The man in my&#160;compartment was the&#160;<br/>
murderer. Who else could he be?”&#160;<br/>
“And you think he went back into&#160;the adjoining compartment?”&#160;<br/>“How do I know where he went?&#160;I had my eyes tight shut.”&#160;<br/>“He might have slipped out through the door into the corridor.”&#160;<br/>“Well, I couldn’t say. You see, I had my eyes tight shut.”&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard sighed convulsively.&#160;<br/>“Mercy, I was scared! If&#160;my&#160;daughter only knew—”&#160;<br/>“You do not think, Madame, that what you heard was the noise of someone moving about&#160;<br/>
next door—in the murdered man’s compartment?”&#160;<br/>
“No, I do not, Mr.—what is it?—Poirot. The man was&#160;<i>right there in&#160;the same compartment&#160;</i><br/>
<i>with me</i>. And what’s more I’ve got proof of it.”&#160;<br/>
Triumphantly, she hauled a large handbag into view and proceeded to burrow in its interior.&#160;<br/>She took out in turn two large clean handkerchiefs,&#160;a pair of horn-rimmed&#160;glasses, a bottle of&#160;<br/>
aspirin, a packet of Glauber’s&#160;Salts, a celluloid tube of bright green peppermints, a bunch of&#160;<br/>keys, a pair of scissors, a book of American Express cheques, a snapshot of an extraordinarily&#160;<br/>plain-looking child, some&#160;letters, five strings&#160;of pseudo-Oriental beads, and a small metal&#160;<br/>object—a button.&#160;<br/>
“You see this button?&#160;Well, it’s not one of&#160;<i>my</i>&#160;buttons. It’s not off anything I’ve got. I found it&#160;<br/>
this morning when I got up.”&#160;<br/>
As she placed it on the table, M. Bouc. leaned forward and gave an exclamation. “But this is a&#160;<br/>
button from&#160;the tunic of&#160;a Wagon Lit attendant!”&#160;<br/>
“There way be a natural explanation for that,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>He turned gently to the lady.&#160;<br/>“This button, Madame, may have dropped from&#160;the conductor’s uniform, either when he&#160;<br/>
searched your cabin or&#160;when he&#160;was making the bed up last night.”&#160;<br/>
“I just don’t know what’s the matter with all you people. Seems&#160;as though you don’t want to&#160;<br/>
do anything but make objections. Now listen here.&#160;I was reading a magazine last night before I&#160;<br/>went to sleep. Before I turned the light out,&#160;I&#160;placed that magazine on a little case that was&#160;<br/>standing on the floor near the&#160;window. Have you got that?”&#160;<br/>
They assured her that they had.&#160;<br/>“Very well then. The conductor looked under the seat from near the door, and then he came&#160;in&#160;<br/>
and bolted the door between me&#160;and the next compartment, but he never went near the window.&#160;<br/>Well, this morning that button was lying right on top of the magazine. What do you call that, I&#160;<br/>should like to know?”&#160;<br/>
“That, Madame, I call evidence,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>The answer seemed to appease the lady.&#160;<br/>“It makes me madder than a hornet to be disbelieved,” she explained.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“You have given us most interesting and valuable evidence,” said Poirot soothingly. “Now&#160;<br/>
may I ask you a few questions?”&#160;<br/>
“Why, certainly.”&#160;<br/>“How was it, since you were nervous of this&#160;man Ratchett, that you hadn’t already bolted the&#160;<br/>
door between the compartments?”&#160;<br/>
“I had,” returned Mrs. Hubbard promptly.&#160;<br/>“Oh, you had?”&#160;<br/>“Well, as a matter of fact I asked that Swedish&#160;creature—a pleasant soul—if it was bolted,&#160;<br/>
and she said&#160;it was.”&#160;<br/>
“How was it you couldn’t see for yourself?”&#160;<br/>“Because I was in bed and my&#160;spongebag was hanging on the door-handle.”&#160;<br/>“What time was it when you asked her to do this for you?”&#160;<br/>“Now let me think. It must have- been round about&#160;half-past ten or a quarter to eleven. She’d&#160;<br/>
come&#160;along to see if I had an aspirin. I told her where to find it and she&#160;got it out of my grip.”&#160;<br/>
“You yourself were in bed?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>Suddenly she laughed. “Poor soul—she was so upset! You see, she’d opened the door of the&#160;<br/>
next compartment by mistake.”&#160;<br/>
“Mr. Ratchett’s?”&#160;<br/>“Yes. You know how difficult it is as you come&#160;along the train and all the doors are shut. She&#160;<br/>
opened his by mistake. She was very distressed about it. He’d laughed, it seemed, and I guess he&#160;<br/>said something not quite nice. Poor thing, she&#160;certainly&#160;was upset.&#160;‘Oh!&#160;I make mistake,’ she&#160;<br/>said. ‘I ashamed make mistake. Not nice&#160;man,’ she said. ‘He say, “You too old.” ’ ”&#160;<br/>
Dr. Constantine sniggered, and Mrs. Hubbard&#160;immediately froze him&#160;with a glance.&#160;<br/>“He wasn’t a nice kind of man,”&#160;she said, “to say a thing like that&#160;to a lady. It’s&#160;not right to&#160;<br/>
laugh at such things.” Dr. Constantine hastily apologised.&#160;<br/>
“Did you hear any noise from&#160;Mr. Ratchett’s&#160;compartment after that?”&#160;asked Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Well—not exactly.”&#160;<br/>“What do you mean by that, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“Well—” She paused. “He snored.”&#160;<br/>“Ah!—he snored, did he?”&#160;<br/>“Terribly. The night before, it kept me&#160;awake.”&#160;<br/>“You didn’t hear him snore after you had had the scare about a man being in your&#160;<br/>
compartment?”&#160;<br/>
“Why, Mr. Poirot, how could I?&#160;He was dead.”&#160;<br/>“Ah, Yes, truly,” said Poirot. He appeared confused.&#160;<br/>“Do you remember the affair of the Armstrong kidnap ping, Mrs. Hubbard?”&#160;he asked.&#160;<br/>“Yes, indeed I do. And how the wretch that did it&#160;escaped scot-free! My, I’d have liked to get&#160;<br/>
my hands on him.”&#160;<br/>
“He has not escaped. He is dead. He died last night.”&#160;<br/>“You don’t mean—?’ Mrs. Hubbard half rose from her chair in excitement.&#160;<br/>“But yes, I do. Ratchett was the man.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Well</i>! Well, to think of that! I must&#160;write and tell my&#160;daughter. Now, didn’t I tell you last&#160;<br/>
night that that man had an evil face?&#160;I was&#160;right, you see. My daughter always says: ‘When&#160;<br/>Mamma’s got a hunch you can bet your bottom&#160;dollar it’s O.K.’ ”&#160;<br/>
“Were you acquainted with any of the Armstrong family, Mrs. Hubbard?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“No. They moved in a very exclusive circle. But I’ve always heard that Mrs. Armstrong was a&#160;<br/>
perfectly lovely woman and that her husband worshipped her.”&#160;<br/>
“Well, Mrs. Hubbard, you have helped us&#160;very much—very much indeed. Perhaps you will&#160;<br/>
give me your full name?”&#160;<br/>
“Why, certainly. Caroline Martha Hubbard.”&#160;<br/>“Will you write your address down here?”&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard did so, without ceasing to speak.&#160;“I just can’t get over it. Cassetti—on this&#160;<br/>
train. I had a hunch about that&#160;man, didn’t I, Mr. Poirot?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, indeed, Madame. By the way, have you a scarlet silk dressing-gown?”&#160;<br/>“Mercy, what a funny question! Why, no. I’ve&#160;got two dressing-gowns with me—a pink&#160;<br/>
flannel one that’s kind of cosy for on board ship, and one my daughter gave me&#160;as a present—a&#160;<br/>kind of local affair in purple silk. But what in&#160;creation do you want to&#160;know about my&#160;dressing-<br/>gowns for?”&#160;<br/>
“Well, you see, Madame, someone in a scarlet kimono entered either your or Mr. Ratchett’s&#160;<br/>
compartment last night. It is, as you said just now, very difficult when all the doors are shut to&#160;<br/>know which compartment is which.”&#160;<br/>
“Well, no one in a scarlet dressing-gown came into my&#160;compartment.”&#160;<br/>“Then she must have gone into Mr. Ratchett’s.”&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard pursed her lips together and said grimly: “That wouldn’t surprise me&#160;any.”&#160;<br/>Poirot leaned forward. “So you heard a woman’s voice next door?”&#160;<br/>“I don’t know how you guessed that, Mr. Poirot. I don’t really. But—well—as a matter of&#160;<br/>
fact, I&#160;<i>did</i>.”&#160;<br/>
“But when I asked you just now if you heard&#160;anything next door, you only said you heard Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett snoring.”&#160;<br/>
“Well, that was true enough. He&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;snore part of the time. As&#160;for the other—” Mrs. Hubbard&#160;<br/>
got rather embarrassed. “It isn’t a&#160;very nice thing to speak about.”&#160;<br/>
“What time was it when you heard a woman’s voice?”&#160;<br/>“I can’t tell you. I just woke up for a minute and heard a woman talking, and it was plain&#160;<br/>
enough where she was. So I just thought, ‘Well,&#160;<i>that’s</i>&#160;the kind of man he is! I’m&#160;not&#160;<br/>surprised’—and then I went to sleep again.&#160;And I’m&#160;sure I should never have mentioned&#160;<br/>anything of the kind to three strange gentlemen if you hadn’t dragged it out of me.”&#160;<br/>
“Was it before the scare about the man in your compartment, or after?”&#160;<br/>“Why, that’s like what you said just now! He&#160;wouldn’t have had a woman talking to him&#160;if he&#160;<br/>
were dead, would he?”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Pardon</i>. You must think me&#160;very stupid, Madame.”&#160;<br/>“I guess even you get kinda muddled now and then.&#160;I just can’t get over its being that monster&#160;<br/>
Cassetti. What my&#160;daughter will say—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot managed adroitly&#160;to help the good lady to replace the contents of her handbag,&#160;and he&#160;<br/>
then shepherded her towards the door.&#160;<br/>
At the last moment, he said:&#160;<br/>“You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame.”&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard looked at the little scrap of cambric he held out to her.&#160;<br/>“That’s not mine, Mr. Poirot. I’ve got mine right here.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Pardon</i>. I thought as it had the initial H on it—”&#160;<br/>

“Well, now, that’s funny, but it’s certainly not&#160;mine. Mine are marked C.M.H., and they’re&#160;<br/>
sensible things—not expensive Paris fallals. What good is a handkerchief like that to anybody’s&#160;<br/>nose?”&#160;<br/>
None of the three men seemed to have an answer to this question and&#160;Mrs. Hubbard sailed out&#160;<br/>
triumphantly.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE SWEDISH LADY&#160;</b><br/>
M. Bouc was handling the button that&#160;Mrs. Hubbard had left behind her.&#160;<br/>
“This button. I cannot understand it. Does it mean&#160;that after all, Pierre&#160;Michel is involved in&#160;<br/>
some&#160;way?” he asked. He paused, then continued, as&#160;Poirot did not reply. “What have you to say,&#160;<br/>my friend?”&#160;<br/>
“That button, it suggests possibilities,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Let us interview next the&#160;<br/>
Swedish lady before we discuss the evidence that we have heard.”&#160;<br/>
He sorted through the pile of passports in front&#160;of him. “Ah! here we are. Greta Ohlsson, age&#160;<br/>
forty-nine.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc gave directions to the restaurant attendant, and presently the lady with the yellowish&#160;<br/>
grey bun of hair and the long, mild, sheep-like face was ushered in.&#160;She peered short-sightedly at&#160;<br/>Poirot through her glasses, but was quite calm.&#160;<br/>
It transpired that she understood and spoke French, so the conversation took place in that&#160;<br/>
language. Poirot first asked her&#160;the questions to which he already knew the answers—her name,&#160;<br/>age, and address. He then asked her her occupation.&#160;<br/>
She was, she told him,&#160;matron in a missionary&#160;school near Stamboul. She was a trained nurse.&#160;<br/>“You know, of course, of what took&#160;place last night, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>“Naturally. It is very&#160;dreadful. And the American lady&#160;tells&#160;me&#160;that the&#160;murderer&#160;was actually&#160;<br/>
in her compartment.”&#160;<br/>
“I hear, Mademoiselle, that you were the last person to see the murdered man alive?”&#160;<br/>“I do not know. It may be so. I opened the door&#160;of his compartment by mistake. I was much&#160;<br/>
ashamed. It was a most awkward mistake.”&#160;<br/>
“You actually saw him?”&#160;<br/>“Yes. He was reading a book. I apologised quickly and withdrew.”&#160;<br/>“Did he say anything to you?”&#160;<br/>A slight flush showed on the worthy lady’s cheek.&#160;<br/>“He laughed and said a few words. I—I did not quite catch them.”&#160;<br/>“And what did you do after that, Mademoiselle?”&#160;asked Poirot, passing from&#160;the subject&#160;<br/>
tactfully.&#160;<br/>
“I went in to the American lady,&#160;Mrs. Hubbard. I asked&#160;her for some&#160;aspirin and she gave it to&#160;<br/>
me.”&#160;<br/>
“Did she ask you whether the communicating door between her compartment and that of Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett was bolted?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“And was it?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“And after that?”&#160;<br/>“After that I went back to my compartment, took the aspirin, and lay down.”&#160;<br/>“What time was all this?”&#160;<br/>“When I got into bed it was five minutes to&#160;eleven. I know&#160;because I looked at my watch&#160;<br/>
before I wound it up.”&#160;<br/>

“Did you go to sleep quickly?”&#160;<br/>“Not very quickly. My head got better, but I lay awake some time.”&#160;<br/>“Had the train come&#160;to a stop before you went to sleep?”&#160;<br/>“I do not think so. We&#160;stopped, I think, at a&#160;station just as I was getting drowsy.”&#160;<br/>“That would be Vincovci. Now your compartment,&#160;Mademoiselle, is this one?” He indicated&#160;<br/>
it on the plan.&#160;<br/>
“That is so, yes.”&#160;<br/>“You had the upper or the lower berth?”&#160;<br/>“The lower berth, No. 10.”&#160;<br/>“And you had a companion?’&#160;<br/>“Yes, a young English lady. Very nice, very amiable. She had travelled from&#160;Baghdad.”&#160;<br/>“After the train left Vincovci,&#160;did she leave the compartment?”&#160;<br/>“No, I am&#160;sure she did not.”&#160;<br/>“Why are you sure if you were asleep?”&#160;<br/>“I sleep very lightly. I am used to waking at&#160;a sound. I am sure that if she had come down&#160;<br/>
from&#160;the berth above I should have awakened.”&#160;<br/>
“Did you yourself leave the compartment?”&#160;<br/>“Not until this morning.”&#160;<br/>“Have you a scarlet silk kimono, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>“No, indeed. I have a good comfortable&#160;dressing-gown of Jaeger material.”&#160;<br/>“And the lady with you, Miss Debenham?&#160;What colour is her dressing-gown?’&#160;<br/>“A pale mauve aba such as you buy in the East.”&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded. Then he asked in a friendly&#160;tone: “Why are you taking this journey?&#160;A&#160;<br/>
holiday?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, I am&#160;going home for a holiday. But first I am&#160;going to Lausanne to stay&#160;with&#160;a sister for&#160;<br/>
a week or so.”&#160;<br/>
“Perhaps you will be so amiable as to write&#160;me&#160;down the name&#160;and address of your sister?’&#160;<br/>“With pleasure.”&#160;<br/>She took the paper and pencil he gave her and&#160;wrote down the name&#160;and address as requested.&#160;<br/>“Have you ever been in America, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>“No. I very nearly went once. I was to go with&#160;an invalid lady, but the plan was cancelled at&#160;<br/>
the last moment. I much&#160;regretted this. They&#160;are very good, the Americans. They give much&#160;<br/>money to found schools and hospitals.&#160;And they are very practical.”&#160;<br/>
“Do you remember hearing of the Armstrong kidnapping case?”&#160;<br/>“No, what was that?”&#160;<br/>Poirot explained.&#160;<br/>Greta Ohlsson was indignant. Her yellow&#160;bun of hair quivered with her emotion.&#160;<br/>“That there are in the world such evil men! It tries one’s faith. The poor mother—my heart&#160;<br/>
aches for her.”&#160;<br/>
The amiable Swede departed, her kindly face flushed, her eyes suffused with tears.&#160;<br/>Poirot was writing busily on a sheet of paper.&#160;<br/>“What is it you write there,&#160;my friend?” asked M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“<i>Mon cher</i>, it is my habit to be neat&#160;and orderly. I make here a&#160;little chronological table of&#160;<br/>
events.”&#160;<br/>
He finished writing and passed the paper to M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>

about&#160;1.17&#160;<br/>
Mrs.&#160;Hubbard thinks man is&#160;in&#160;her carriage.&#160;Rings&#160;for conductor.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>M. Bouc nodded approval.&#160;<br/>“That is very clear,” he said.&#160;<br/>“There is nothing there that&#160;strikes you as&#160;at all odd?”&#160;<br/>“No, it seems&#160;all quite clear and aboveboard.&#160;It seems&#160;quite plain that the crime was&#160;<br/>
committed at&#160;1.15. The evidence of the watch shows&#160;us that, and Mrs. Hubbard’s story fits in.&#160;<br/>For my mind, I will make a guess&#160;at the identity of the murderer.&#160;I say, my friend, that it is the&#160;<br/>big Italian. He comes from&#160;America—from&#160;Chicago—and remember an Italian’s weapon is the&#160;<br/>knife, and he stabs not once but several times.”&#160;<br/>
“That is true.”&#160;<br/>“Without a doubt, that is the solution of the mystery. Doubtless he&#160;and this Ratchett were in&#160;<br/>
this kidnapping business together.&#160;Cassetti is&#160;an Italian&#160;name. In&#160;some&#160;way Ratchett did on him&#160;<br/>what they call the double-cross. The Italian tracks him&#160;down, sends&#160;him&#160;warning letters first, and&#160;<br/>finally revenges himself upon him&#160;in a brutal way. It is all quite simple.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot shook his head doubtfully.&#160;<br/>“It is hardly so simple as&#160;that, I fear,” he murmured.&#160;<br/>“Me, I am&#160;convinced it is the truth,” said&#160;M. Bouc, becoming more and more enamoured of&#160;<br/>
his theory.&#160;<br/>
“And what about the valet with&#160;the toothache who swears that&#160;the Italian never left the&#160;<br/>
compartment?”&#160;<br/>
“That is the difficulty.”&#160;<br/>Poirot twinkled.&#160;<br/>“Yes, it is annoying, that. Unlucky for your theory, and extremely&#160;lucky for our Italian friend&#160;<br/>
that M. Ratchett’s valet should have had the toothache.”&#160;<br/>
“It will be explained,” said M.&#160;Bouc with magnificent certainty.&#160;<br/>Poirot shook his head again.&#160;<br/>“No, it is hardly so simple as that,” he murmured again.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE RUSSIAN PRINCESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Let us hear what Pierre&#160;Michel has to say about&#160;this button,” he said.&#160;<br/>
The Wagon Lit conductor was recalled. He looked at them&#160;inquiringly.&#160;<br/>M. Bouc cleared his throat.&#160;<br/>“Michel,” he said, “here is a&#160;button from&#160;your tunic. It was&#160;found in the American lady’s&#160;<br/>
compartment. What have you to say for yourself about it?”&#160;<br/>
The conductor’s hand went automatically to his tunic. “I have lost no button, Monsieur,” he&#160;<br/>
said. “There must be some mistake.”&#160;<br/>
“That is very odd.”&#160;<br/>“I cannot account for it, Monsieur.”&#160;The man seemed astonished, but not in any way guilty or&#160;<br/>
confused.&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc said meaningly: “Owing to the circumstances in which it was found, it seems fairly&#160;<br/>
certain that this button was dropped by the man&#160;who was in Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment last&#160;<br/>night when she rang the bell.”&#160;<br/>
“But, Monsieur, there was no one there. The lady must have imagined it.”&#160;<br/>“She did&#160;not imagine it,&#160;Michel.&#160;The assassin&#160;of&#160;M. Ratchett passed&#160;that&#160;way—<i>and dropped&#160;</i><br/>
<i>that button</i>.”&#160;<br/>
As the significance of M. Bouc’s words became&#160;plain to him,&#160;Pierre Michel flew into a&#160;<br/>
violent state of agitation.&#160;<br/>
“It is not true, Monsieur; it is not true!” he&#160;cried. “You are accusing me of the crime. Me, I am&#160;<br/>
innocent. I am&#160;absolutely innocent! Why should I want to kill&#160;a Monsieur whom&#160;I have never&#160;<br/>seen before?”&#160;<br/>
“Where were you when Mrs. Hubbard’s bell rang?”&#160;<br/>“I told you, Monsieur, in the next&#160;coach talking to&#160;my&#160;colleague.”&#160;<br/>“We will send for him.”&#160;<br/>“Do so, Monsieur, I implore you, do so.”&#160;<br/>The conductor of the next coach was summoned.&#160;He immediately confirmed Pierre Michel’s&#160;<br/>
statement. He added that the conductor from&#160;the Bucharest coach had also been there. The three&#160;<br/>of them&#160;had been discussing the situation caused&#160;by the snow. They had been talking some&#160;ten&#160;<br/>minutes when Michel fancied he heard a bell. As he opened the doors connecting the two&#160;<br/>coaches, they had all heard it plainly—a bell ringing repeatedly. Michel had run post-haste to&#160;<br/>answer it.&#160;<br/>
“So you see,&#160;Monsieur, I am&#160;not guilty,” cried Michel anxiously.&#160;<br/>“And this button from&#160;a Wagon Lit&#160;tunic, how do you explain it?”&#160;<br/>“I cannot, Monsieur. It&#160;is&#160;a mystery to me. All&#160;my buttons are intact.”&#160;<br/>Both of the other conductors also declared that&#160;they had not lost a button; also that they had&#160;<br/>
not been inside Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment at any time.&#160;<br/>
“Calm&#160;yourself, Michel,” said M. Bouc, “and&#160;cast your mind back to the moment when you&#160;<br/>
ran to answer Mrs. Hubbard’s bell. Did&#160;you meet anyone at all in the corridor?”&#160;<br/>
“No, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Did you see anyone going away from you down&#160;the corridor in the other direction?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
61<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=62></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Again, no, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Odd,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Not so very,” said Poirot. “It is a question&#160;of time. Mrs. Hubbard wakes to find someone in&#160;<br/>
her compartment. For a&#160;minute or two she lies paralysed, her eyes shut. Probably it was then that&#160;<br/>the man slipped out into the corridor. Then she&#160;starts ringing the bell. But the conductor does not&#160;<br/>come&#160;at once. It is only&#160;the third&#160;or fourth peal that he hears. I&#160;should say myself&#160;that there&#160;was&#160;<br/>ample time—”&#160;<br/>
“For what? For what,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>! Remember, there are thick drifts&#160;of snow all round the train.”&#160;<br/>“There are two courses open to our mysterious assassin,” said Poirot slowly. “He could retreat&#160;<br/>
into either of the toilets or—he could disappear into one of the compartments.”&#160;<br/>
“But they were all occupied.”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“You mean that he could&#160;retreat into his&#160;<i>own</i>&#160;compartment?”&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded.&#160;<br/>“It fits—it fits;’ murmured M. Bouc. “During&#160;that ten minutes’ absence of the conductor, the&#160;<br/>
murderer comes from&#160;his own compartment, goes into Ratchett’s, kills him, locks and chains the&#160;<br/>door on the inside, goes out through Mrs. Hubbard’s&#160;compartment, and is&#160;back safely in his own&#160;<br/>compartment by the time the conductor arrives.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot murmured: “It is not quite so simple as&#160;that, my&#160;friend. Our friend the doctor here will&#160;<br/>
tell you so.”&#160;<br/>
With a gesture M. Bouc signified that the three conductors might depart.&#160;<br/>“We have still to see eight passengers,” said&#160;Poirot. “Five&#160;first-class passengers—Princess&#160;<br/>
Dragomiroff, Count and Countess Andrenyi,&#160;Colonel Arbuthnot, and Mr. Hardman. Three&#160;<br/>second-class passengers—Miss Debenham, Antonio&#160;Foscarelli, and the lady’s-maid, Fräulein&#160;<br/>Schmidt.”&#160;<br/>
“Whom&#160;will you see first—the Italian?”&#160;<br/>“How you harp on your Italian! No, we will start at the top of the tree. Perhaps Madame&#160;la&#160;<br/>
Princesse will be so good as to spare us a few moments of her time. Convey that message to her,&#160;<br/>Michel.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Oui, Monsieur</i>,” said the conductor, who was just&#160;leaving the car.&#160;<br/>“Tell her we can wait on her in her compartment if she does not wish to put herself to the&#160;<br/>
trouble of coming here,” called M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>
But Princess Dragomiroff declined to take this course. She appeared&#160;in the dining-car,&#160;<br/>
inclined her head slightly&#160;and sat down opposite Poirot.&#160;<br/>
Her small toad-like face looked even yellower&#160;than the day before. She was certainly ugly,&#160;<br/>
and yet, like the toad, she had&#160;eyes like jewels, dark and imperious, revealing latent energy and&#160;<br/>an intellectual force that could be felt at once.&#160;<br/>
Her voice was deep, very distinct, with a slight grating quality in it.&#160;<br/>She cut short a flowery phrase of apology from&#160;M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“You need not offer apologies, Messieurs. I understand a murder has taken place. Naturally&#160;<br/>
you must interview all the passengers. I shall be glad to give you&#160;all the assistance in my power.”&#160;<br/>
“You are most amiable, Madame,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Not at all. It is a duty. What do you wish to know?”&#160;<br/>“Your full Christian names and address, Madame. Perhaps you would prefer to write them&#160;<br/>
yourself?”&#160;<br/>
Poirot proffered a sheet of paper and pencil, but the Princess waved them&#160;aside.&#160;<br/>

“You can write it,” she said. “There is nothing difficult. Natalia Dragomiroff, 17 Avenue&#160;<br/>
Kléber, Paris.”&#160;<br/>
“You are travelling home from&#160;Constantinople, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“Yes. I have been staying at the Austrian Embassy. My maid is with me.”&#160;<br/>“Would you be so good as to give me&#160;a brief&#160;account of your movements last night from&#160;<br/>
dinner onwards?”&#160;<br/>
“Willingly. I directed the conductor to make up&#160;my bed whilst I was in the dining-car. I&#160;<br/>
retired to bed immediately after dinner. I read&#160;until the hour of&#160;eleven, when I turned out my&#160;<br/>light. I was unable to sleep owing to certain rheumatic pains from&#160;which I suffer. At about a&#160;<br/>quarter to one I rang for my maid. She massaged me&#160;and then read aloud till I felt sleepy. I&#160;<br/>cannot say exactly, when she left me. It may have&#160;been half an hour afterward, it may have been&#160;<br/>later.”&#160;<br/>
“The train had stopped then?”&#160;<br/>“The train had stopped.”&#160;<br/>“You heard nothing—nothing unusual during the time, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“I heard nothing unusual.”&#160;<br/>“What is your maids name?”&#160;<br/>“Hildegarde&#160;Schmidt.”&#160;<br/>“She has been with you long?”&#160;<br/>“Fifteen years.”&#160;<br/>“You consider her trustworthy?”&#160;<br/>“Absolutely. Her people come from&#160;an&#160;estate of my late husband’s in Germany.”&#160;<br/>“You have been in America, I presume, Madame?”&#160;<br/>The abrupt change of subject made the&#160;old lady raise her eyebrows. “Many times.”&#160;<br/>“Were you at any time acquainted with a family&#160;of the name&#160;of Armstrong—a family in&#160;<br/>
which a tragedy occurred?”&#160;<br/>
With some emotion in her voice the old lady said: “You speak of friends of mine, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“You knew Colonel Armstrong well, then?”&#160;<br/>“I knew him slightly, but his&#160;wife, Sonia Armstrong, was my&#160;god-daughter. I was on terms of&#160;<br/>
friendship with her mother, the actress, Linda Arden. Linda Arden was a great genius, one of the&#160;<br/>greatest tragic actresses in the world.&#160;As Lady Macbeth, as Magda, there was no one to touch&#160;<br/>her. I was not only an admirer of her art, I was a personal friend.”&#160;<br/>
“She is dead?”&#160;<br/>“No, no, she is alive, but she lives in complete retirement. Her health is very delicate, and she&#160;<br/>
has to lie on a sofa most of the time.”&#160;<br/>
“There was, I think, a second daughter?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, much younger than Mrs. Armstrong.”&#160;<br/>“And she is alive?”&#160;<br/>“Certainly.”&#160;<br/>“Where is she?”&#160;<br/>The old woman bent an acute glance at him.&#160;<br/>“I must ask you the reason for these questions.&#160;What have they to do&#160;with the matter in&#160;<br/>
hand—the murder on this train?”&#160;<br/>
“They are connected in this way,&#160;Madame: the man who was murdered was&#160;the man&#160;<br/>
responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Mrs. Armstrong’s child.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah!”&#160;<br/>

The straight brows came together. Princess Dragomiroff drew herself a little more erect.&#160;<br/>“In my&#160;view, then, this murder is&#160;an entirely&#160;admirable happening! You will pardon my&#160;<br/>
slightly biased point of view.”&#160;<br/>
“It is most natural, Madame. And now to return to the question you did not answer. Where is&#160;<br/>
the younger daughter of Linda Arden,&#160;the sister of Mrs. Armstrong?”&#160;<br/>
“I honestly cannot tell you, Monsieur. I have lost touch with the younger generation. I believe&#160;<br/>
she married an Englishman some years ago and&#160;went to England, but at the moment I cannot&#160;<br/>recollect the name.”&#160;<br/>
She paused a minute and then said:&#160;<br/>“Is there anything further you want to ask me, gentlemen?”&#160;<br/>“Only one thing, Madame, a somewhat personal question. The colour of your dressing-<br/>
gown.”&#160;<br/>
She raised her eyebrows slightly. “I must&#160;suppose you have a reason for such a question. My&#160;<br/>
dressing-gown is of black satin.”&#160;<br/>
“There is nothing more, Madame. I am much obliged to you for answering my&#160;questions so&#160;<br/>
promptly.”&#160;<br/>
She made a slight gesture with her heavily beringed hand. Then as she&#160;rose, and the others&#160;<br/>
rose with her, she stopped.&#160;<br/>
“You will excuse me, Monsieur,”&#160;she said, “but&#160;may I ask your name? Your face is somehow&#160;<br/>
familiar to me.”&#160;<br/>
“My name, Madame, is Hercule Poirot—at your service.”&#160;<br/>She was silent a minute, then: “Hercule Poirot,” she said. “Yes. I remember now. This is&#160;<br/>
Destiny.”&#160;<br/>
She walked away, very erect, a little stiff in her movements.&#160;<br/>“<i>Voilà une grande dame</i>,” said M. Bouc. “What do you&#160;think of her, my friend?”&#160;<br/>But Hercule Poirot merely shook his head.&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;wondering,” he said, “what she meant by Destiny.”&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF COUNT AND COUNTESS ANDRENYI&#160;</b><br/>
Count and Countess Andrenyi were next summoned. The Count, however, entered the dining-car&#160;<br/>alone.&#160;<br/>
There was no doubt that he was a fine-looking man&#160;seen face to face. He was at least six feet&#160;<br/>
in height, with broad shoulders&#160;and slender hips. He was dressed&#160;in very well-cut English tweeds&#160;<br/>and might have been taken for an Englishman had it not been for the length of his moustache and&#160;<br/>something in the line of the cheekbone.&#160;<br/>
“Well, Messieurs,” he said, “what can I do for you?”&#160;<br/>“You understand, Monsieur,” said Poirot, “that in view of what&#160;has occurred I am&#160;obliged to&#160;<br/>
put certain questions to all the passengers.”&#160;<br/>
“Perfectly, perfectly,”&#160;said the Count easily. “I&#160;quite understand your position. Not, I fear, that&#160;<br/>
my wife and I can do much to assist you. We&#160;were asleep and heard nothing at all.”&#160;<br/>
“Are you aware of the identity&#160;of the deceased, Monsieur?”&#160;<br/>“I understood&#160;it was the big American—a man with&#160;a decidedly unpleasant&#160;face. He sat at that&#160;<br/>
table at meal times.” He indicated with a nod&#160;of his head the table&#160;at which Ratchett and&#160;<br/>MacQueen had sat.&#160;<br/>
“Yes, yes, Monsieur, you are&#160;perfectly correct. I&#160;meant—did you know the name&#160;of the man?”&#160;<br/>“No.” The Count looked thoroughly&#160;puzzled by Poirot’s queries.&#160;<br/>“If you want to know his name,” he&#160;said, “surely it is on his passport?”&#160;<br/>“The name&#160;on his passport is Ratchett,” said Poirot. “But that, Monsieur,&#160;is not his real name.&#160;<br/>
He is the man Cassetti, who was responsible&#160;for a celebrated kidnapping&#160;outrage in America.”&#160;<br/>
He watched the Count closely as he spoke, but the latter seemed quite unaffected by this piece&#160;<br/>
of news. He merely opened his eyes a little.&#160;<br/>
“Ah!” he said. “That certainly&#160;should throw light upon the matter. An extraordinary country,&#160;<br/>
America.”&#160;<br/>
“You have been there, perhaps, Monsieur le Comte?”&#160;<br/>“I was in Washington for a year.”&#160;<br/>“You knew, perhaps, the Armstrong family?”&#160;<br/>“Armstrong—Armstrong—it is difficult to recall.&#160;One met so many.” He smiled, shrugged his&#160;<br/>
shoulders. “But to come&#160;back to the matter in&#160;hand, gentlemen,” he said. “What more&#160;can I do to&#160;<br/>assist you?”&#160;<br/>
“You retired to rest—when, Monsieur le Comte?”&#160;<br/>Hercule Poirot’s eyes stole to his plan. Count&#160;and Countess Andrenyi occupied compartment&#160;<br/>
Nos. 12 and 13 adjoining.&#160;<br/>
“We had one compartment made up for the night&#160;whilst we were in the dining-car. On&#160;<br/>
returning we&#160;sat in the other for a while—”&#160;<br/>
“Which number would that be?”&#160;<br/>“No. 13. We played piquet together. At about eleven o’clock my&#160;wife retired for the night.&#160;<br/>
The conductor made up my compartment and I also&#160;went to bed. I slept&#160;soundly until morning.”&#160;<br/>
“Did you notice the stopping of the train?”&#160;<br/>“I was not aware of it till this morning.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“And your wife?”&#160;<br/>The Count smiled. “My wife always takes a sleeping draught when travelling by train. She&#160;<br/>
took her usual dose of trional.”&#160;<br/>
He paused. “I am&#160;sorry I am&#160;not able to assist you in any way.”&#160;<br/>Poirot passed him&#160;a sheet of paper and a pen.&#160;<br/>“Thank you,&#160;Monsieur&#160;le Comte. It is&#160;a formality,&#160;but will you&#160;just let&#160;me&#160;have your name&#160;and&#160;<br/>
address?”&#160;<br/>
The Count wrote slowly and carefully.&#160;<br/>“It is just as well that I should write this for you,” he said pleasantly.&#160;“The spelling of&#160;my&#160;<br/>
country estate is a little&#160;difficult for those unacquainted with the language.”&#160;<br/>
He passed the paper across to Poirot and rose.&#160;<br/>“It will be quite unnecessary for my&#160;wife to&#160;come&#160;here,” he said. “She can tell you nothing&#160;<br/>
more than I have.”&#160;<br/>
A little gleam came&#160;into Poirot’s eye.&#160;<br/>“Doubtless, doubtless,” he said. “But all the same&#160;I think I should like to have just one little&#160;<br/>
word with Madame&#160;la Comtesse.”&#160;<br/>
“I assure you it is quite&#160;unnecessary.” The Count’s voice rang out authoritatively.&#160;<br/>Poirot blinked gently at him.&#160;<br/>“It will be a mere formality,” he said.&#160;“But, you understand, it is necessary&#160;for my&#160;report.”&#160;<br/>“As you please.”&#160;<br/>The Count gave way grudgingly. He made a&#160;short foreign bow and left the dining-car.&#160;<br/>Poirot reached out a hand to a&#160;passport. It set out&#160;the Count’s names and titles. He passed on&#160;<br/>
to the further information. “<i>Accompanied by</i>, wife;&#160;<i>Christian name</i>, Elena Maria;&#160;<i>maiden name</i>,&#160;<br/>Goldenberg;&#160;<i>age</i>, twenty.” A spot of grease had been dropped on it at some&#160;time&#160;by a careless&#160;<br/>official.&#160;<br/>
“A diplomatic passport,” said M. Bouc. “We must be careful, my friend, to give no offence.&#160;<br/>
These people can have nothing to do with the murder.”&#160;<br/>
“Be easy,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>, I will be most tactful. A mere formality.”&#160;<br/>His voice dropped as the Countess Andrenyi&#160;entered the dining-car.&#160;She looked timid and&#160;<br/>
extremely charming.&#160;<br/>
“You wish to see me, Messieurs?”&#160;<br/>“A mere formality, Madam&#160;la Comtesse.” Poirot rose gallantly, bowed&#160;her into&#160;the seat&#160;<br/>
opposite him. “It is only to ask you if you saw or&#160;heard anything last night that may throw light&#160;<br/>upon this matter.”&#160;<br/>
“Nothing at all, Monsieur. I was asleep.”&#160;<br/>“You did not hear, for instance,&#160;a commotion going on in the compartment next to yours?&#160;The&#160;<br/>
American lady who occupies it had quite an attack of hysterics and rang for the conductor.”&#160;<br/>
“I heard nothing, Monsieur. You see,&#160;I had taken a sleeping draught.”&#160;<br/>“Ah! I comprehend. Well, I need&#160;not detain you further.” Then, as&#160;she rose swiftly—“Just one&#160;<br/>
little minute. These particulars—your maiden name, age and so on—they are correct?”&#160;<br/>
“Quite correct, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Perhaps you will sign&#160;this memorandum&#160;to that effect, then.”&#160;<br/>She signed quickly, in a graceful slanting hand-writing—<i>Elena Andrenyi</i>.&#160;<br/>“Did you accompany your husband to America, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur.” She smiled, flushed a little.&#160;“We were not married then; we have been&#160;<br/>
married only a year.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“Ah, yes, thank you, Madame. By the way, does your husband smoke?”&#160;<br/>She stared at him&#160;as she&#160;stood poised for departure.&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“A pipe?”&#160;<br/>“No. Cigarettes and cigars.”&#160;<br/>“Ah! Thank you.”&#160;<br/>She lingered, her eyes watching him&#160;curiously.&#160;Lovely eyes they were, dark and almond-<br/>
shaped with very long black lashes that swept the exquisite pallor of her cheeks. Her lips, very&#160;<br/>scarlet in the foreign fashion, were parted just a little. She looked&#160;exotic and beautiful.&#160;<br/>
“Why did you ask me&#160;that?”&#160;<br/>“Madame,” Poirot waved an airy hand, “detectives have to ask all sorts of questions. For&#160;<br/>
instance, perhaps you will tell me&#160;the colour of your dressing-gown?”&#160;<br/>
She stared at him.&#160;Then she laughed. “it is corn-coloured chiffon. Is that really important?”&#160;<br/>“Very important, Madame.”&#160;<br/>She asked curiously: “Are you really a detective, then?”&#160;<br/>“At your service, Madame.”&#160;<br/>“I thought there were no detectives on the train when it passed through Jugo-Slavia—not until&#160;<br/>
one got to Italy.”&#160;<br/>
“I am&#160;not a Jugo-Slavian detective, Madame. I am&#160;an international detective.”&#160;<br/>“You belong to the League of Nations?”&#160;<br/>“I belong to the world, Madame,”&#160;said Poirot dramatically. He&#160;went on: “I work mainly in&#160;<br/>
London. You speak English?” he added in that language.&#160;<br/>
“I speak a leetle, yes.” Her accent&#160;was charming. Poirot bowed once more.&#160;<br/>“We will not detain you further, Madame. You see, it was not so very terrible.”&#160;<br/>She smiled, inclined her head and departed.&#160;<br/>“<i>Elle est jolie femme</i>,” said M. Bouc appreciatively. He&#160;sighed. “Well, that&#160;did not advance us&#160;<br/>
much.”&#160;<br/>
“No,” said Poirot. “Two people who saw nothing and heard nothing.”&#160;<br/>“Shall we now see the Italian?”&#160;<br/>Poirot did not reply for a moment. He was studying a grease spot on a Hungarian diplomatic&#160;<br/>
passport.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF&#160;COLONEL ARBUTHNOT&#160;</b><br/>
Poirot roused&#160;himself&#160;with a slight&#160;start. His eyes&#160;twinkled a little as they&#160;met the eager ones of&#160;<br/>M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>
“Ah! my dear old friend,” he&#160;said, “you see I have become&#160;what&#160;they call the&#160;snob! The first&#160;<br/>
class, I feel it should be attended to before the second class.&#160;Next, I think, we will interview the&#160;<br/>good-looking Colonel Arbuthnot.”&#160;<br/>
Finding the Colonel’s French to be of a severely limited description, Poirot conducted his&#160;<br/>
interrogatory&#160;in English.&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot’s&#160;name, age, home&#160;address and&#160;exact&#160;military&#160;standing were all ascertained. Poirot&#160;<br/>
proceeded:&#160;<br/>
“It is that you come home from&#160;India on&#160;what is called the leave—what we can call&#160;<i>en&#160;</i><br/>
<i>permission</i>?”&#160;<br/>
Colonel Arbuthnot, uninterested in what a pack&#160;of foreigners called&#160;anything, replied with&#160;<br/>
true British brevity, “Yes.”&#160;<br/>
“But you do not come home on the P. &amp; O. boat?”&#160;<br/>“No.”&#160;<br/>“Why not?”&#160;<br/>“I chose to come by the overland&#160;route for reasons of my own.”&#160;<br/>(“And that,” his manner seemed to say, “is one&#160;for you, you interfering&#160;little jackanapes.”)&#160;<br/>“You came straight through from&#160;India?”&#160;<br/>The Colonel replied drily: “I stopped for one night to see Ur of the Chaldees, and for three&#160;<br/>
days in Baghdad with the A.O.C., who happens to be an old friend of mine.”&#160;<br/>
“You stopped three days in Baghdad. I understand that the young English lady, Miss&#160;<br/>
Debenham, also comes from&#160;Baghdad. Perhaps you met her there?”&#160;<br/>
“No, I did not. I first met Miss Debenham when&#160;she and I shared the railway convoy car from&#160;<br/>
Kirkuk to Nissibin.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot leaned forward. He became persuasive and a little more foreign than he&#160;need have&#160;<br/>
been.&#160;<br/>
“Monsieur, I am&#160;about to appeal to you. You and Miss Debenham&#160;are the only two English&#160;<br/>
people on the train. It is necessary that I should ask you each your opinion of the other.”&#160;<br/>
“Highly irregular,” said&#160;Colonel Arbuthnot coldly.&#160;<br/>“Not so. You see, this crime, it was&#160;most probably committed by a woman. The man was&#160;<br/>
stabbed no fewer than twelve times. Even the&#160;<i>chef de train</i>&#160;said at once,&#160;‘It is a woman.’ Well,&#160;<br/>then, what is my first task? To give all the&#160;women travelling on the Istanbul-Calais coach what&#160;<br/>Americans call the ‘once-over.’ But to judge of an Englishwoman&#160;is difficult. They are very&#160;<br/>reserved, the English. So&#160;I appeal&#160;to you, Monsieur, in the interest of&#160;justice. What sort of person&#160;<br/>is this Miss Debenham?&#160;What do you know about her?”&#160;<br/>
“Miss Debenham,” said the Colonel with some warmth, “is a lady.”&#160;<br/>“Ah!” said Poirot with every appearance of&#160;being much gratified. “So you do not think that&#160;<br/>
she is likely to be implicated in this crime?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
68<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=69></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“The idea is absurd,” said Arbuthnot. “The man was a perfect stranger—she had never seen&#160;<br/>
him&#160;before.”&#160;<br/>
“Did she tell you so?”&#160;<br/>“She did. She commented at once upon his somewhat unpleasant appearance. If a woman is&#160;<br/>
concerned, as you seem&#160;to think (to my mind without any evidence but on a mere assumption), I&#160;<br/>can assure you that Miss Debenham&#160;could not possibly be implicated.”&#160;<br/>
“You feel warmly in the matter,” said&#160;Poirot with a smile.&#160;<br/>Colonel Arbuthnot gave him&#160;a&#160;cold stare. “I really don’t&#160;know what you mean,” he said.&#160;<br/>The stare seemed to abash Poirot. He dropped his eyes and began fiddling with the papers in&#160;<br/>
front of him.&#160;<br/>
“All this is by the way,” he said. “Let us be practical and come&#160;to facts. This crime,&#160;we have&#160;<br/>
reason to believe, took place at a quarter past one last&#160;night. It is part of the necessary routine to&#160;<br/>ask everyone on the train what he or she was doing at that time.”&#160;<br/>
“Quite so. At a quarter past one, to the best&#160;of my belief, I was talking to the young American&#160;<br/>
fellow—secretary to the dead man.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah! were you in his compartment, or was he in yours?”&#160;<br/>“I was in his.”&#160;<br/>“That is the young man of the name&#160;of MacQueen?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“He was a friend or acquaintance of yours?”&#160;<br/>“No, I never saw him&#160;before this journey. We&#160;fell into casual conversation yesterday and both&#160;<br/>
became interested. I don’t as a rule like Americans—haven’t any use for ’em—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot smiled, remembering MacQueen’s strictures on “Britishers.”&#160;<br/>“—but I liked this young fellow. He’d got hold of some tomfool idiotic ideas about the&#160;<br/>
situation in India. That’s the worst of&#160;Americans—they’re so sentimental and idealistic. Well, he&#160;<br/>was interested in what I had to tell him. I’ve had nearly thirty years’&#160;experience of the country.&#160;<br/>And I was interested in what he&#160;had to tell me&#160;about the working of Prohibition in America.&#160;<br/>Then we got down to world politics in general.&#160;I was quite surprised to look at my&#160;watch and&#160;<br/>find it was a quarter to two.”&#160;<br/>
“That is the time you broke up this conversation?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“What did you do then?”&#160;<br/>“Walked along to my&#160;own compartment and turned in.”&#160;<br/>“Your bed was made up ready?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“That is the compartment—let me&#160;see—No. 15—the&#160;one next but one to the end away from&#160;<br/>
the dining-car?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“Where was the conductor when you went to your compartment?”&#160;<br/>“Sitting at the end at a little table. As a matter of fact MacQueen&#160;called him&#160;just as I went in&#160;<br/>
to my&#160;own compartment.”&#160;<br/>
“Why did he call him?”&#160;<br/>“To make up his bed, I suppose. The compartment hadn’t been made up for the night.”&#160;<br/>“Now, Colonel Arbuthnot, I want you to think&#160;carefully. During the time&#160;you were talking to&#160;<br/>
Mr. MacQueen, did anyone pass along the corridor outside the door?”&#160;<br/>
“A good many people, I should think.&#160;I wasn’t paying attention.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
69<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=70></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Ah! but I am referring to—let us say, the last&#160;hour and a half of&#160;your conversation. You got&#160;<br/>
out at Vincovci, didn’t you?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, but only for about a minute. There was a&#160;blizzard on. The cold was something frightful.&#160;<br/>
Made one quite thankful to get&#160;back to the fug, though as a rule&#160;I think the way these trains are&#160;<br/>overheated is something scandalous.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc sighed. “It is very difficult to please everybody,” he said. “The English they open&#160;<br/>
everything—then others they come&#160;along and&#160;shut everything. It&#160;is very difficult.”&#160;<br/>
Neither Poirot nor Colonel Arbuthnot paid any attention to him.&#160;<br/>“Now, Monsieur, cast your mind back,” said Poirot encouragingly. “It was cold outside. You&#160;<br/>
have returned to the train. You sit down&#160;again, you smoke—perhaps a cigarette—perhaps a&#160;<br/>pipe—”&#160;<br/>
He paused for the fraction of a second.&#160;<br/>“A pipe for me. MacQueen smoked cigarettes.”&#160;<br/>“The train starts again. You smoke your pipe. You discuss the state of Europe—of the world.&#160;<br/>
It is late now. Most people&#160;have retired for the night. Does anyone pass the door?&#160;Think.”&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot frowned in the effort of remembrance.&#160;<br/>“Difficult to say,” he said. “You see I wasn’t paying any attention.”&#160;<br/>“But you have the soldier’s observation for detail. You notice without noticing, so to speak.”&#160;<br/>The Colonel thought again, but shook his head.&#160;<br/>“I couldn’t say. I don’t remember anyone passing except the conductor. Wait a minute—and&#160;<br/>
there was a woman, I think.”&#160;<br/>
“You saw her?&#160;Was she old—young?”&#160;<br/>“Didn’t see her. Wasn’t looking&#160;that way. just a rustle and&#160;a sort of smell of scent.”&#160;<br/>“Scent? A&#160;<i>good</i>&#160;scent?”&#160;<br/>“Well, rather fruity, if you know what I mean. I mean you’d smell it a hundred yards away.&#160;<br/>
But mind you,” the Colonel went on&#160;hastily, “this may have been earlier in the evening. You see,&#160;<br/>as you said just now, it was just&#160;one of those things you notice&#160;without noticing, so to speak.&#160;<br/>Some time that evening I said to myself—‘Woman—scent—got it on pretty thick.’ But&#160;<i>when</i>&#160;it&#160;<br/>was I can’t be sure, except that—why, yes, it must have been after Vincovci.”&#160;<br/>
“Why?”&#160;<br/>“Because I remember—sniffing, you know—just when I was talking about the utter washout&#160;<br/>
Stalin’s Five Year Plan was turning out. I know the idea&#160;<i>woman</i>&#160;brought the idea of the position&#160;<br/>of women in Russia into my mind. And I know we hadn’t got on to&#160;Russia until pretty near the&#160;<br/>end of our talk.”&#160;<br/>
“You can’t pin it down more definitely than that?”&#160;<br/>“N-no. It must have been roughly within the last half-hour.”&#160;<br/>“It was after the train had stopped?”&#160;<br/>The other nodded. “Yes, I’m&#160;almost sure it was.”&#160;<br/>“Well, we will pass from that. Have you ever been&#160;in America,&#160;Colonel Arbuthnot?”&#160;<br/>“Never. Don’t want to go.”&#160;<br/>“Did you ever know a Colonel Armstrong?”&#160;<br/>“Armstrong—Armstrong—I’ve known two or&#160;three Armstrongs. There was Tommy&#160;<br/>
Armstrong in the 60th—you don’t mean him?&#160;And Selby Armstrong—he was killed on the&#160;<br/>Somme.”&#160;<br/>
“I mean the Colonel Armstrong who married an&#160;American wife and whose only child was&#160;<br/>
kidnapped and killed.”&#160;<br/>

across the fellow, though of course I knew&#160;of him.&#160;Toby Armstrong. Nice fellow. Everybody&#160;<br/>liked him. He had a very distinguished career. Got the V.C.”&#160;<br/>
“The man who was killed last night was the&#160;man responsible for the murder of Colonel&#160;<br/>
Armstrong’s child.”&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot’s face grew rather grim. “Then in&#160;my opinion the swine deserved what he got.&#160;<br/>
Though I would have preferred to see him&#160;properly hanged—or electrocuted, I suppose, over&#160;<br/>there.”&#160;<br/>
“In fact, Colonel Arbuthnot, you prefer&#160;law and order to private vengeance?”&#160;<br/>“Well, you can’t go about having blood feuds and stabbing each other like Corsicans or the&#160;<br/>
Mafia,” said the Colonel. “Say what you&#160;like, trial by jury is a sound system.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked at him&#160;thoughtfully for a minute or two.&#160;<br/>“Yes,” he said. I am&#160;sure that would be your&#160;view. Well, Colonel Arbuthnot, I do not think&#160;<br/>
there is anything more I have to ask you. There is&#160;nothing you yourself can&#160;recall last night that&#160;<br/>in any way snuck you—or shall we say strikes you now, looking back—as suspicious?”&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot considered for a moment or two.&#160;<br/>“No,” he said. “Nothing at all. Unless—” he hesitated.&#160;<br/>“But yes, continue, I pray of you.”&#160;<br/>“Well, it’s nothing really,” said&#160;the Colonel slowly. “But you said&#160;<i>anything</i>.”&#160;<br/>“Yes, yes. Go on.”&#160;<br/>“Oh! it’s nothing. A mere detail. But as I got back to my&#160;compartment I noticed that the door&#160;<br/>
of the one beyond mine—the end one, you know—”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, No. 16.”&#160;<br/>“Well, the door of it was not quite closed. And the fellow inside peered out in a furtive sort of&#160;<br/>
way. Then he pulled the door to quickly. Of course I know&#160;there’s nothing in that—but it just&#160;<br/>struck me as a bit odd. I mean, it’s quite usual to&#160;open a door and stick your head out if you want&#160;<br/>to see anything. But it was the furtive way he did it that caught my attention.”&#160;<br/>
“Ye-es,” said Poirot doubtfully.&#160;<br/>“I told you there was nothing to it,” said Arbuthnot, apologetically.&#160;“But you know what it&#160;<br/>
is—early hours of the morning—everything very still. The thing had a sinister look—like a&#160;<br/>detective story. All nonsense really.”&#160;<br/>
He rose. “Well, if you don’t want me&#160;any more—”&#160;<br/>“Thank you, Colonel Arbuthnot,&#160;there is nothing else.”&#160;<br/>The soldier hesitated for a minute. His first natural distaste for being questioned by&#160;<br/>
“foreigners” had evaporated.&#160;<br/>
“About Miss Debenham,” he said rather awkwardly. “You can take it from&#160;me&#160;that she’s all&#160;<br/>
right. She’s a&#160;<i>pukka sahib</i>.”&#160;<br/>
Flushing a little,&#160;he withdrew.&#160;<br/>“What,” asked Dr. Constantine with interest, “does a&#160;<i>pukka sahib&#160;</i>mean?”&#160;<br/>“It means,” said Poirot, “that Miss Debenham’s&#160;father and brothers were at the same&#160;kind of&#160;<br/>
school as Colonel Arbuthnot was.”&#160;<br/>
“Oh! said Dr. Constantine, disappointed. “Then&#160;it has nothing to do with the crime at all.”&#160;<br/>“Exactly,”, said, Poirot.&#160;<br/>He fell into a reverie, beating a light&#160;tattoo on the table. Then he looked up.&#160;<br/>“Colonel Arbuthnot smokes a pipe,” he said.&#160;“In the compartment of Mr. Ratchett I found a&#160;<br/>
pipe-cleaner. Mr. Ratchett smoked only cigars.”&#160;<br/>

“You think—?”&#160;<br/>“He is the only man so&#160;far who admits to&#160;smoking a pipe. And he knew of Colonel&#160;<br/>
Armstrong—perhaps actually did know&#160;him,&#160;though he won’t admit it.”&#160;<br/>
“So you think it possible—?”&#160;<br/>Poirot shook his head violently.&#160;<br/>“That is just it—it is&#160;<i>im</i>possible—quite impossible—that&#160;an honourable, slightly stupid,&#160;<br/>
upright Englishman should stab an enemy twelve times with a knife! Do you not feel, my&#160;<br/>friends, how impossible it is?”&#160;<br/>
“That is the psychology,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“And one must respect the psychology. This crime has a signature,&#160;and it is certainly not the&#160;<br/>
signature of Colonel Arbuthnot. But now to our next interview.”&#160;<br/>
This time M. Bouc did not mention the Italian. But he thought of him.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF MR. HARDMAN&#160;</b><br/>
The last of the first-class passengers to be interviewed, Mr.&#160;Hardman, was the big flamboyant&#160;<br/>American who had shared a table&#160;with the Italian and the valet.&#160;<br/>
He wore a somewhat loud check suit, a pink&#160;shirt, and a flashy tie-pin, and was rolling&#160;<br/>
something round his tongue as he&#160;entered the dining-car. He had a big, fleshy, coarse-featured&#160;<br/>face, with a good-humoured expression.&#160;<br/>
“Morning, gentlemen,” he said. “What can I do for you?”&#160;<br/>“You have heard of this murder, Mr.—er—Hardman?”&#160;<br/>“Sure.” He shifted the chewing gum&#160;deftly.&#160;<br/>“We are of necessity interviewing&#160;all the passengers on the train.”&#160;<br/>“That’s all right by me. Guess that’s&#160;the only way to tackle the job.”&#160;<br/>Poirot consulted the passport lying in front of him.&#160;<br/>“You are Cyrus Bethman Hardman, United States subject, forty-one years of age,&#160;travelling&#160;<br/>
salesman for typewriting ribbons?”&#160;<br/>
“O.K. That’s me.”&#160;<br/>you are travelling from&#160;Stamboul to Paris?”&#160;<br/>“That’s so.”&#160;<br/>“Reason?”&#160;<br/>“Business.”&#160;<br/>“Do you always travel first-class, Mr. Hardman?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, sir. The firm&#160;pays my&#160;travelling expenses. “ He winked.&#160;<br/>“Now, Mr. Hardman, we come&#160;to&#160;the events of last night.”&#160;<br/>The American nodded.&#160;<br/>“What can you tell us about the matter?”&#160;<br/>“Exactly nothing at all.”&#160;<br/>“Ah, that is a pity. Perhaps, Mr. Hardman, you will tell us exactly what you did last night&#160;<br/>
from&#160;dinner onwards?”&#160;<br/>
For the first time the American did not seem&#160;ready with his reply. At last he said: “Excuse me,&#160;<br/>
gentlemen, but just who are you?&#160;Put me&#160;wise.”&#160;<br/>
“This is M. Bouc, a director&#160;of the Compagnie des Wagons Lits. This gentleman is the doctor&#160;<br/>
who examined the body.”&#160;<br/>
“And you yourself?”&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;Hercule Poirot. I am engaged by the company to investigate this matter.”&#160;<br/>“I’ve heard of you,” said Mr. Hardman. He reflected a minute or two longer. “Guess I’d better&#160;<br/>
come clean.”&#160;<br/>
“It will certainly be advisable for you to&#160;tell us all you know,” said Poirot drily.&#160;<br/>“You’d have said a mouthful if there was anything I&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;know. But I don’t. I know nothing at&#160;<br/>
all—just as I&#160;said. But I&#160;<i>ought</i>&#160;to know something. That’s what makes me&#160;sore. I&#160;<i>ought</i>&#160;to.”&#160;<br/>
“Please explain, Mr. Hardman.”&#160;<br/>

Mr. Hardman sighed, removed the chewing gum, and dived into a pocket. At the same&#160;time&#160;<br/>
his whole personality seemed to undergo a change. He became less of a stage character and more&#160;<br/>of a real person. The resonant nasal&#160;tones of his voice became&#160;modified.&#160;<br/>
“That passport’s a bit of bluff,” he&#160;said. “That’s who I really am.”&#160;<br/>Poirot scrutinised the card flipped across to&#160;him. M. Bouc peered over his shoulder.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>Poirot knew the name&#160;as that of one of the&#160;best-known and most reputable private detective&#160;<br/>
agencies in New York.&#160;<br/>
“Now, Mr. Hardman,” he said, “let&#160;us hear the meaning of this.”&#160;<br/>“Sure. Things came about this&#160;way. I’d come&#160;over to Europe&#160;trailing a couple of crooks—<br/>
nothing to do with this business. The chase ended in&#160;Stamboul. I wired the Chief and got his&#160;<br/>instructions to return,&#160;and I would have been making my&#160;tracks back to little old New York when&#160;<br/>I got this.”&#160;<br/>
He pushed across a letter.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>THE TOKATLLAN HOTEL&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Dear Sir:&#160;<br/>
You have been pointed out to me&#160;as an operative&#160;of the McNeil Detective Agency. Kindly&#160;<br/>
report at my&#160;suite at four o’clock this afternoon.&#160;<br/>
S. E. RATCHETT&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>“<i>Eh bien</i>?”&#160;<br/>“I reported at the time stated,&#160;and Mr. Ratchett put me&#160;wise to the situation. He showed me&#160;a&#160;<br/>
couple of letters he’d got.”&#160;<br/>
“He was alarmed?”&#160;<br/>“Pretended not to be, but he was rattled, all right. He put up a proposition to me. I was to&#160;<br/>
travel by the same&#160;train as he did to Parrus&#160;and see that nobody got him. Well, gentlemen, I&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;<br/>travel by the same&#160;train, and in spite of me, somebody&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;get him. I certainly feel sore about it.&#160;<br/>It doesn’t look any too good for me.”&#160;<br/>
“Did he give you any indication&#160;of the line you were to take?”&#160;<br/>“Sure. He had it all taped out. It was his idea that I should travel in the compartment alongside&#160;<br/>
his. Well, that blew up right at the start. The&#160;only place I could get was berth No. 16, and I had a&#160;<br/>job getting that. I guess the conductor likes to keep that compartment up his sleeve. But that’s&#160;<br/>neither here nor there. When I looked all round&#160;the situation, it seemed to&#160;me&#160;that No. 16 was a&#160;<br/>

pretty good strategic position.&#160;There was only the dining-car in front of the Stamboul sleeping-<br/>car, and the door onto the platform&#160;at the front end was barred&#160;at night. The only way a thug&#160;<br/>could come was through the rear-end door to the platform, or along&#160;the train from&#160;the rear, and in&#160;<br/>either case he’d have to pass right by&#160;my&#160;compartment.”&#160;<br/>
“You had no idea, I suppose, of the identity of the possible assailant?”&#160;<br/>“Well, I knew what he looked like. Mr. Ratchett described him to me.”&#160;<br/>“What?”&#160;<br/>All three men leaned forward eagerly.&#160;<br/>Hardman went on.&#160;<br/>“A small man—dark—with a womanish kind of voice. That’s what the old man said. Said,&#160;<br/>
too, that he didn’t think it would be the first night out, More&#160;likely the second or third.”&#160;<br/>
“He knew something,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“He certainly knew more&#160;than he told his secretary,” commented Poirot thoughtfully. “Did he&#160;<br/>
tell you anything about this enemy of&#160;his?&#160;Did he, for instance, say&#160;<i>why</i>&#160;his life was threatened?”&#160;<br/>
“No, he was kinda reticent about&#160;that part of it. just said the fellow-was out for his blood and&#160;<br/>
meant to get it.”&#160;<br/>
“A small man—dark—with a womanish voice,” repeated Poirot thoughtfully. Then, fixing a&#160;<br/>
sharp glance on Hardman, he asked: “You&#160;knew who he really was, of course?”&#160;<br/>
“Which, Mister?”&#160;<br/>“Ratchett. You recognised him?”&#160;<br/>“I don’t get you.”&#160;<br/>“Ratchett was Cassetti, the Armstrong murderer.”&#160;<br/>Mr. Hardman gave vent to a prolonged whistle.&#160;<br/>“That certainly is some&#160;surprise!”&#160;he&#160;said. “Yes,&#160;<i>sir</i>! No, I didn’t recognise him. I was away&#160;<br/>
out West when that case came on. I suppose I saw&#160;photos of him&#160;in the papers, but I wouldn’t&#160;<br/>recognise my own mother when a newspaper photographer got through with her. Well, I don’t&#160;<br/>doubt that a few people had it&#160;in for Cassetti all right.”&#160;<br/>
Do you know of anyone connected with the Armstrong case who answers to that description:&#160;<br/>
small—dark—womanish voice?”&#160;<br/>
Hardman reflected a minute or two. “It’s hard to&#160;say. Pretty nearly everyone connected with&#160;<br/>
that case is dead.”&#160;<br/>
“There was the girl who threw herself out of the window, remember.”&#160;<br/>“Sure. That’s a good point, that. She was a foreigner of some&#160;kind. Maybe she had some&#160;Wop&#160;<br/>
relations. But you’ve got to remember that there were other cases besides the Armstrong one.&#160;<br/>Cassetti had been running this&#160;kidnapping stunt for some&#160;time.&#160;You can’t concentrate on that&#160;<br/>only.”&#160;<br/>
Ah, but we have reason to&#160;believe that this crime&#160;<i>is</i>&#160;connected with the Armstrong case.”&#160;<br/>Mr. Hardman cocked an inquiring eye. Poirot&#160;did not respond. The American shook his head.&#160;<br/>“I can’t call to mind anybody answering that description in&#160;the Armstrong case,” he said&#160;<br/>
slowly. “But of course I wasn’t in&#160;it and didn’t know&#160;much about it.”&#160;<br/>
“Well, continue your narrative, Mr. Hardman.”&#160;<br/>“There’s very little to tell. I got my sleep in&#160;the daytime and stayed awake on the watch at&#160;<br/>
night. Nothing suspicious happened the first night. Last night was the same, as far as I was&#160;<br/>concerned. I had my&#160;door a little ajar&#160;and watched. No stranger passed.”&#160;<br/>
“You are sure of that, Mr. Hardman?”&#160;<br/>

“I’m&#160;plumb certain. Nobody got on that train from&#160;outside, and nobody came along the train&#160;<br/>
from&#160;the rear carriages. I’ll take my&#160;oath on that.”&#160;<br/>
“Could you see the conductor from&#160;your position?”&#160;<br/>“Sure. He sits on that little seat almost flush with my door.”&#160;<br/>“Did he leave that seat at all&#160;after the train stopped at Vincovci?”&#160;<br/>“That was the last station?&#160;Why, yes, he answered a couple of bells—that would be just after&#160;<br/>
the train came&#160;to a halt for good. Then, after that, he&#160;went past me into the rear coach—was there&#160;<br/>about a quarter of an hour. There was a bell ringing like mad and&#160;he came back running. I&#160;<br/>stepped out into the corridor to&#160;see what it was all about—felt a mite nervous, you understand—<br/>but it was only the American dame. She was raising hell about something or other, I grinned.&#160;<br/>Then he went on to another compartment and came back and got a bottle of mineral water for&#160;<br/>someone. After that he settled down in his seat&#160;till he went up to the far end to make somebody’s&#160;<br/>bed up. I don’t think he stirred after that until about five o’clock this morning.”&#160;<br/>
“Did he doze off at all?”&#160;<br/>“That I can’t say. He may have.”&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded. Automatically his hands straightened the papers on the table. He picked up the&#160;<br/>
official card once more.&#160;<br/>
“Be so good as just to initial this,” he said.&#160;<br/>The other complied.&#160;<br/>“There is no one, I suppose, who can confirm&#160;your story of your&#160;identity, Mr. Hardman?”&#160;<br/>“On this train?&#160;Well, not exactly. Unless it&#160;might be young MacQueen. I know him&#160;well&#160;<br/>
enough—I’ve seen him&#160;in his father’s office in New York. But that’s not to say he’ll remember&#160;<br/>me&#160;from a crowd of other operatives. No, Mr.&#160;Poirot, you’ll have to wait and cable New York&#160;<br/>when the snow lets up. But it’s O.K. I’m&#160;not telling the tale. Well,&#160;so long, gentlemen. Pleased to&#160;<br/>have met you, Mr. Poirot.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot proffered his cigarette case.&#160;“But perhaps you prefer a pipe?”&#160;<br/>“Not me.” He helped himself, then strode briskly off.&#160;<br/>The three men looked at each other.&#160;<br/>“You think he is genuine?” asked Dr. Constantine.&#160;<br/>“Yes, yes. I know the type. Besides, it is a story that would&#160;be very easy to disprove.”&#160;<br/>“He has given us a piece of very interesting evidence,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Yes, indeed.”&#160;<br/>“A small man—dark—with a high-pitched voice,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully.&#160;<br/>“A description which applies to&#160;no one on the train,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE ITALIAN&#160;</b><br/>
“And now,” said Poirot with a twinkle in his eye,&#160;“we will delight&#160;the&#160;heart of&#160;M. Bouc and see&#160;<br/>the Italian.”&#160;<br/>
Antonio Foscarelli came&#160;into the dining-car with&#160;a swift, cat-like tread. His face beamed. It&#160;<br/>
was a typical Italian face, sunny-looking and swarthy.&#160;<br/>
He spoke French well and fluently with only a slight accent.&#160;<br/>“Your name&#160;is Antonio Foscarelli?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“You are, I see, a naturalised American subject?”&#160;<br/>The American grinned. “Yes, Monsieur. It is better for my&#160;business.”&#160;<br/>“You are an agent for Ford motor cars?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, you see—”&#160;<br/>A voluble exposition followed. At the end of it&#160;anything that the three men did not know&#160;<br/>
about Foscarelli’s business methods, his journeys, his income, and his opinion of the United&#160;<br/>States and most European countries seemed a negligible factor. This was not a man who had to&#160;<br/>have information dragged from&#160;him. It gushed out.&#160;<br/>
His good-natured, childish face beamed with satisfaction as, with a last&#160;eloquent&#160;gesture,&#160;he&#160;<br/>
paused and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief.&#160;<br/>
“So you see,” he said. “I do big business. I&#160;am&#160;up to date. I understand salesmanship!”&#160;<br/>“You have been in the United States, then, for the last ten years on and off.”&#160;<br/>Yes, Monsieur. Ah! well do I remember the day I&#160;first took&#160;the boat—to&#160;go&#160;to America, so far&#160;<br/>
away! My mother, my&#160;little sister—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot cut short the&#160;flood of reminiscence.&#160;<br/>“During your sojourn in the United States,&#160;did you ever come across the deceased?”&#160;<br/>“Never. But I know the type. Oh! yes.” He snapped his fingers expressively. “It is very&#160;<br/>
respectable, very well-dressed, but&#160;underneath it is all wrong. Out of my&#160;experience I should say&#160;<br/>he was the big crook. I give you my&#160;opinion for what it is worth.”&#160;<br/>
“Your opinion is quite right,” said Poirot&#160;drily. “Ratchett was Cassetti, the kidnapper.”&#160;<br/>“What did I tell you? I have learned to be very acute—to read&#160;the face. It&#160;is necessary. Only in&#160;<br/>
America do they teach you the proper way to sell. I—”&#160;<br/>
“You remember the Armstrong case?”&#160;<br/>“I do not quite remember. The name, yes?&#160;It was a little girl, a baby, was it not?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, a very&#160;tragic affair.”&#160;<br/>The Italian seemed the first person to demur to this view.&#160;<br/>“Ah! well, these things they happen,” he said&#160;philosophically, “in a great civilisation such as&#160;<br/>
America—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot cut him short. “Did you ever come&#160;across any members of the Armstrong family?”&#160;<br/>“No, I do not think so. It is difficult to say. I&#160;will give you some&#160;figures. Last year alone, I&#160;<br/>
sold—”&#160;<br/>
“Monsieur, pray confine&#160;yourself to the point.”&#160;<br/>The Italian’s hands flung themselves out in&#160;a gesture of apology. “A thousand pardons.”&#160;<br/>

“Tell me, if you please, your exact movements last night from dinner onwards.”&#160;<br/>“With pleasure. I stay here as long as I can.&#160;It is more amusing. I talk to the American&#160;<br/>
gentleman at&#160;my&#160;table.&#160;He sells typewriter ribbons. Then I go back to my&#160;compartment. It is&#160;<br/>empty. The miserable John Bull who shares it with me&#160;is away attending to his master. At last he&#160;<br/>comes back—very long&#160;face as usual. He will&#160;not talk—says yes and no. A miserable race, the&#160;<br/>English—not sympathetic. He sits&#160;in the corner, very stiff,&#160;reading a book, Then the conductor&#160;<br/>comes and makes our beds.”&#160;<br/>
“Nos. 4 and 5,” murmured Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Exactly—the end compartment. Mine is the upper berth. I get up there. I smoke and read.&#160;<br/>
The little Englishman has, I think,&#160;the toothache.&#160;He gets&#160;out a little bottle of&#160;stuff&#160;that smells&#160;<br/>very strong. He lies in bed and groans. Presently I sleep. Whenever&#160;I wake I hear him&#160;groaning.”&#160;<br/>
“Do you know if he left the carriage at all during the night?”&#160;<br/>“I do not think so. That, I should hear. The light from the corridor—one wakes up&#160;<br/>
automatically thinking it is the customs examination at some&#160;frontier.”&#160;<br/>
“Did he ever speak of his master?&#160;Ever express any animus against him?”&#160;<br/>“I tell you he did not speak. He was not sympathetic. A fish.”&#160;<br/>“You smoke, you say—a pipe, cigarettes, cigar?”&#160;<br/>“Cigarettes only.”&#160;<br/>Poirot proffered one, which he accepted.&#160;<br/>“Have you ever been to Chicago?” inquired M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Oh! yes—a fine city—but I know best New York, Cleveland, Detroit. You have been to the&#160;<br/>
States? No?&#160;You should go. It—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot pushed a sheet of&#160;paper across to him.&#160;<br/>“If you will sign this, and put your permanent address, please.”&#160;<br/>The Italian wrote with a flourish. Then he&#160;rose, his smile as engaging as ever.&#160;<br/>“That is all? You do not require me&#160;further?&#160;Good day to you, Messieurs. I wish we could get&#160;<br/>
out of the snow. I have an appointment in Milan.” He shook his&#160;head sadly. “I&#160;shall lose&#160;the&#160;<br/>business.” He&#160;departed.&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked at his friend.&#160;<br/>“He has been a long time in America,” said M. Bouc, “and he is an Italian, and Italians use the&#160;<br/>
knife! And they are great liars! I do not like Italians.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Ça se voit</i>,” said Poirot with a smile “Well, it may&#160;be that you are right, but I will point out&#160;<br/>
to you, my&#160;friend, that there is absolutely no evidence against the man.”&#160;<br/>
“And what about the psychology?&#160;Do not Italians stab?”&#160;<br/>“Assuredly,” said Poirot. “Especially in the heat&#160;of a quarrel. But this—this is a different kind&#160;<br/>
of crime. I have the little idea, my&#160;friend, that this is a crime&#160;very carefully planned and staged. It&#160;<br/>is a far-sighted, long-headed crime.&#160;it is not—how shall I express it?—a&#160;<i>Latin</i>&#160;crime. It is a&#160;crime&#160;<br/>that shows traces of a cool, resourceful, deliberate brain—I think an Anglo-Saxon brain—”&#160;<br/>
He picked up the last two passports.&#160;<br/>“Let us now,” he said, “see Miss Mary Debenham.”&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF MISS DEBENHAM&#160;</b><br/>
When Mary Debenham&#160;entered the dining-car she confirmed Poirot’s previous estimate of her.&#160;<br/>She was very neatly dressed in a little black suit&#160;with a French grey shirt, and the smooth waves&#160;<br/>of her dark head were neat&#160;and unruffled. Her manner was as&#160;calm&#160;and unruffled as her hair.&#160;<br/>
She sat down opposite Poirot and M. Bouc and looked at&#160;them inquiringly.&#160;<br/>“Your name is Mary Hermione Debenham&#160;and you are twenty-six years of age?” began&#160;<br/>
Poirot.&#160;<br/>
“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“English?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“Will you be&#160;so kind, Mademoiselle, as to write down your permanent address on this piece&#160;<br/>
of paper?”&#160;<br/>
She complied. Her writing was clear and legible.&#160;<br/>“And now, Mademoiselle, what have you to&#160;tell us of the affair last night?”&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;afraid I have nothing to tell you. I went to bed and slept.”&#160;<br/>“Does it distress&#160;you very much, Mademoiselle, that a crime has been committed on this&#160;<br/>
train?”&#160;<br/>
The question was clearly unexpected.&#160;Her grey eyes widened a little.&#160;<br/>“I don’t quite understand you?”&#160;<br/>“It was a perfectly simple question that I asked you, Mademoiselle. I will repeat it. Are you&#160;<br/>
very much distressed that a crime should have been committed on this train?”&#160;<br/>
“I have not really thought about it from that point of view. No, I cannot say that I am at all&#160;<br/>
distressed.”&#160;<br/>
“A crime—it is all in the day’s work to you, eh?”&#160;<br/>“It is naturally an unpleasant thing to have happen,” said Mary Debenham quietly.&#160;<br/>“You are very Anglo-Saxon, Mademoiselle.&#160;<i>Vous n’éprouvez pas d’émotion</i>.”&#160;<br/>She smiled a little. “I am&#160;afraid I cannot have&#160;hysterics to prove my&#160;sensibility. After all,&#160;<br/>
people die every day.”&#160;<br/>
“They die, yes. But murder&#160;is a little&#160;more rare.”&#160;<br/>“Oh! certainly.”&#160;<br/>“You were not acquainted with the dead man?”&#160;<br/>“I saw him&#160;for the first time when lunching here yesterday.”&#160;<br/>“And how did he strike you?”&#160;<br/>“I hardly noticed him.”&#160;<br/>“He did not impress you as an evil personality?”&#160;<br/>She shrugged her shoulders slightly. “Really, I cannot say I thought about it.”&#160;<br/>Poirot looked at her keenly.&#160;<br/>“You are, I think, a little bit contemptuous of the way I prosecute&#160;my inquiries,” he said with&#160;<br/>
a twinkle. “Not so, you think, would an English inquiry be conducted.&#160;There everything would&#160;<br/>be cut and dried—it would be&#160;all kept to&#160;the facts—a well-ordered business. But I,&#160;<br/>Mademoiselle, have my&#160;little originalities. I&#160;look first at my witness, I sum&#160;up his or her&#160;<br/>

character, and I frame my questions accordingly. just a little minute ago I am&#160;asking questions of&#160;<br/>a gentleman who wants to tell me all his ideas on&#160;every subject. Well, him&#160;I keep strictly to the&#160;<br/>point. I want him&#160;to answer yes&#160;or no. This or that. And then&#160;you come. I see at once that you&#160;<br/>will be orderly and methodical. You will confine&#160;yourself to the matter in hand. Your answers&#160;<br/>will be brief&#160;and to the point. And because, Mademoiselle, human nature is perverse, I ask of&#160;you&#160;<br/>quite different questions. I ask what you feel, what you think. It does not please you, this&#160;<br/>method?”&#160;<br/>
“If you will forgive my&#160;saying so, it seems somewhat of a waste of time. Whether or not&#160;I&#160;<br/>
liked Mr. Ratchett’s face does not seem&#160;likely&#160;to be&#160;helpful in finding out who killed him.”&#160;<br/>
“Do you know who the man Ratchett&#160;really was, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>She nodded. “Mrs. Hubbard has&#160;been telling everyone.”&#160;<br/>“And what do you think of the Armstrong affair?”&#160;<br/>“It was quite abominable,” said the girl crisply.&#160;<br/>Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.&#160;<br/>“You are travelling from Baghdad, I believe, Miss Debenham?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“To London?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“What have you been doing in Baghdad?”&#160;<br/>“I have been acting as governess to two children.”&#160;<br/>“Are you returning to your&#160;post after your&#160;holiday?”&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;not sure.”&#160;<br/>“Why is that?”&#160;<br/>“Baghdad is rather out of things. I think I should prefer a post&#160;in London if I can hear of a&#160;<br/>
suitable&#160;one.”&#160;<br/>
“I see. I thought, perhaps, you&#160;might be going to be married.”&#160;<br/>Miss Debenham&#160;did not&#160;reply. She raised her eyes and looked Poirot full in the face. The&#160;<br/>
glance said plainly: “You&#160;are impertinent.”&#160;<br/>
“What is your opinion of the lady who shares your compartment—Miss Ohlsson?”&#160;<br/>“She seems a pleasant, simple creature.”&#160;<br/>“What colour is her dressing-gown?”&#160;<br/>Mary Debenham&#160;stared. “A kind of&#160;brownish colour—natural wool.”&#160;<br/>“Ah! I may mention without indiscretion, I hope,&#160;that I noticed the colour of your dressing-<br/>
gown on the way from&#160;Aleppo to Stamboul. A pale mauve, I believe.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, that is right.”&#160;<br/>“Have you any other dressing-gown, Mademoiselle?&#160;A scarlet dressing-gown, for example?”&#160;<br/>“No, that is not mine.”&#160;<br/>Poirot leant forward. He was&#160;like a cat pouncing on a mouse.&#160;<br/>“Whose, then?’&#160;<br/>The girl drew back a little, startled. “I don’t know. What do you mean?”&#160;<br/>“You do not say, ‘No, I have no such thing.’ You say, ‘That is not mine.’ Meaning that such a&#160;<br/>
thing does belong to someone else.”&#160;<br/>
She nodded.&#160;<br/>“Somebody else on this train?”&#160;<br/>‘Yes.”&#160;<br/>“Whose is it?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“I told you just now: I don’t know. I woke up this&#160;morning about five o’clock with the feeling&#160;<br/>
that the train had been standing still for a long time. I opened the door and looked out into the&#160;<br/>corridor, thinking we might be&#160;at a station. I saw someone in&#160;a scarlet kimono some way down&#160;<br/>the corridor.”&#160;<br/>
“And you don’t know who it was?&#160;Was she&#160;fair, or dark, or grey-haired?”&#160;<br/>“I can’t say. She had on a shingle cap and I only saw the back of her head.”&#160;<br/>“And in build?”&#160;<br/>“Tallish and slim, I should judge, but it’s difficult to say. The kimono was embroidered with&#160;<br/>
dragons.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, yes, that is right—dragons.” He was silent a minute. He&#160;murmured to himself. “I cannot&#160;<br/>
understand. I cannot understand. None of this makes sense.”&#160;<br/>
Then, looking up, he said: “I need not&#160;keep you further, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“Oh!” She seemed rather taken aback but rose promptly.&#160;<br/>In the doorway, however, she hesitated a minute and then came&#160;back.&#160;<br/>“The Swedish lady—Miss Ohlsson, is it?—seems rather worried. She says you told her she&#160;<br/>
was the last person to see this man alive.&#160;She&#160;thinks, I believe, that&#160;you suspect her on that&#160;<br/>account. Can’t I tell her that she has made a mistake?&#160;Really, you know, she is the kind of&#160;<br/>creature who wouldn’t hurt a fly.”&#160;She smiled a little as she spoke.&#160;<br/>
“What time was it that she went to fetch the aspirin from&#160;Mrs. Hubbard?”&#160;<br/>“Just after half-past ten.”&#160;<br/>“She was away—how long?”&#160;<br/>“About five minutes.”&#160;<br/>“Did she leave the compartment again during the night?”&#160;<br/>“No.”&#160;<br/>Poirot turned to the doctor. “Could Ratchett have&#160;been killed&#160;as early as that?”&#160;<br/>The doctor shook his head.&#160;<br/>“Then I think you can reassure&#160;your friend, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“Thank you.” She smiled suddenly at him,&#160;a smile&#160;that invited sympathy.&#160;“She’s like a sheep,&#160;<br/>
you know. She gets anxious and bleats.”&#160;<br/>
She turned and went out.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE GERMAN LADY’S-MAID&#160;</b><br/>
M. Bouc was looking at&#160;his friend curiously.&#160;<br/>
“I do not quite understand you,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>. You were trying to do—what?”&#160;<br/>“I was searching for a flaw, my friend.”&#160;<br/>“A flaw?”&#160;<br/>“Yes—in the armour of a young lady’s self-possession. I wished to shake her&#160;<i>sang-froid</i>. Did&#160;<br/>
I succeed?&#160;I do not know. But I know&#160;this: she did not expect me&#160;to tackle the matter as I did.”&#160;<br/>
“You suspect her,” said M.&#160;Bow slowly. “But why? She seems a very charming young lady—<br/>
the last person in the world to be&#160;mixed up in a crime of this kind.”&#160;<br/>
“I agree,” said Constantine. “She is cold.&#160;She has not emotions. She would not stab a man—<br/>
she would sue him&#160;in the law courts.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot sighed.&#160;<br/>“You must, both of you, get rid&#160;of your obsession that this&#160;is an unpremeditated and sudden&#160;<br/>
crime. As for the reasons why I suspect Miss&#160;Debenham,&#160;there are two. One is because of&#160;<br/>something that I overheard, and that you do not as yet know.”&#160;<br/>
He retailed to them&#160;the curious interchange of&#160;phrases he had overheard on the journey from&#160;<br/>
Aleppo.&#160;<br/>
“That is curious, certainly,” said M. Bouc when he had finished. “It needs explaining. If it&#160;<br/>
means what&#160;you suspect it means, then they are&#160;both of them in it together—she and the stiff&#160;<br/>Englishman.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot nodded.&#160;<br/>“And that is just what is not borne out by the&#160;facts,” he said. “See you,&#160;if they were both in&#160;<br/>
this together, what should we expect to find?&#160;That each of them would provide an alibi for the&#160;<br/>other. Is not that so?&#160;But&#160;no—that does not happen. Miss Debenham’s&#160;alibi is provided by a&#160;<br/>Swedish woman whom&#160;she has never seen before, and Colonel Arbuthnot’s&#160;alibi is vouched for&#160;<br/>by MacQueen, the dead mans secretary. No, that solution of the puzzle is too easy.”&#160;<br/>
“You said there was another reason for your suspicions of her,” M. Bouc, reminded him.&#160;<br/>Poirot smiled.&#160;<br/>“Ah! but that is only psychological.&#160;I ask myself, is it possible for Miss Debenham&#160;to have&#160;<br/>
planned this crime? Behind this business, I am&#160;convinced, there is a cool, intelligent, resourceful&#160;<br/>brain. Miss Debenham&#160;answers&#160;to that description.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc shook his head. “I think you are wrong, my friend. I do not&#160;see that young English&#160;<br/>
girl as a criminal.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah! Well,” said Poirot, picking up the last passport. “To&#160;the final name&#160;on our list.&#160;<br/>
Hildegarde Schmidt, lady’s-maid.”&#160;<br/>
Summoned by the attendant, Hildegarde Schmidt came into the restaurant car and stood&#160;<br/>
waiting respectfully.&#160;<br/>
Poirot motioned her to sit down.&#160;<br/>She did so, folding her hands and waiting placidly till he questioned her. She seemed a placid&#160;<br/>
creature altogether—eminently respectable, perhaps not over-intelligent.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
82<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=83></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
Poirot’s methods with Hildegarde Schmidt were&#160;a complete contrast to his handling of Mary&#160;<br/>
Debenham.&#160;<br/>
He was at his kindest and most&#160;genial, setting the woman at her ease. Then, having got her to&#160;<br/>
write down her name&#160;and address, he slid gently into his questions.&#160;<br/>
The interview took place in German.&#160;<br/>“We want to know as much as possible about&#160;what happened last night,” he said. “We know&#160;<br/>
that you cannot give us much information bearing on the crime itself, but you may have seen or&#160;<br/>heard something that, while conveying nothing to&#160;you, may be valuable to us. You understand?”&#160;<br/>
She did not seem&#160;to. Her broad, kindly face remained set in its expression&#160;of placid stupidity&#160;<br/>
as she answered:&#160;<br/>
“I do not know anything, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Well, for instance you know that your&#160;mistress sent for you last night.”&#160;<br/>“That, yes.”&#160;<br/>“Do you remember the time?”&#160;<br/>“I do not, Monsieur. I was asleep, you see,&#160;when the attendant came and told me.”&#160;<br/>“Yes, yes. Was it usual for you to be sent for in this way?”&#160;<br/>“It was not unusual, Monsieur. The gracious lady&#160;often required attention&#160;at night. She did not&#160;<br/>
sleep well.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Eh bien</i>, then, you received the summons and you&#160;got up. Did you put on a dressing-gown?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur, I put on a few clothes. I would&#160;not like to go in to her Excellency in my&#160;<br/>
dressing-gown.”&#160;<br/>
“And yet it is a very nice dressing-gown—scarlet,&#160;is it not?”&#160;<br/>She stared at him.&#160;“It is a dark&#160;blue flannel dressing-gown, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Ah! continue. A little pleasantry on&#160;my&#160;part,&#160;that is all. So you went along to Madame&#160;la&#160;<br/>
Princesse. And what did you do when you got there?”&#160;<br/>
“I gave her massage, Monsieur, and then I read&#160;aloud. I do not read aloud very well, but her&#160;<br/>
Excellency says that&#160;is all the better—so it sends her better to sleep. When she became&#160;sleepy,&#160;<br/>Monsieur, she told me&#160;to go, so I closed the&#160;book and I returned to my&#160;own compartment.”&#160;<br/>
“Do you know what time that was?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Well, how long had you been with Madame&#160;la Princesse?”&#160;<br/>“About half an hour, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Good, continue.”&#160;<br/>“First,&#160;I&#160;fetched her&#160;Excellency an&#160;extra&#160;rug from&#160;my compartment. It was very&#160;cold in&#160;spite&#160;<br/>
of the heating. I arranged the rug over her, and&#160;she wished me good night. I poured her out some&#160;<br/>mineral water. Then I turned&#160;out the light and left her.&#160;<br/>
“And then?”&#160;<br/>“There is nothing more, Monsieur. I returned to my carriage and went to sleep.”&#160;<br/>“And you met no one in the corridor?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“You did not, for instance, see a lady in&#160;a scarlet kimono with dragons on it?”&#160;<br/>Her mild eyes bulged at him.&#160;“No, indeed, Monsieur. There was&#160;nobody about except the&#160;<br/>
attendant. Everyone was asleep.”&#160;<br/>
“But you did see the conductor?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“What was he doing!”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
83<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=84></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“He came out of one of the&#160;compartments, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“What?” M.&#160;Bouc leaned forward. “Which one?”&#160;<br/>Hildegarde Schmidt looked frightened again, and Poirot cast a reproachful glance at his&#160;<br/>
friend.&#160;<br/>
“Naturally,” he said. “The conductor often has&#160;to answer bells at night. Do you remember&#160;<br/>
which compartment it was?”&#160;<br/>
“It was about the middle of the coach, Monsieur. Two or three doors from&#160;Madame&#160;la&#160;<br/>
Princesse.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah! tell us, if you please, exactly&#160;where this was and what happened?”&#160;<br/>“He nearly ran into me, Monsieur. It was when&#160;I was returning from&#160;my&#160;compartment to that&#160;<br/>
of the Princess with the rug.”&#160;<br/>
“And he came out of a compartment and almost&#160;collided with you. In which direction was he&#160;<br/>
going?”&#160;<br/>
“Towards me, Monsieur. He apologised and passed on down the corridor towards the dining-<br/>
car. A bell began ringing, but I do not think he answered it.” She paused and then said: “I do not&#160;<br/>understand. How is it—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot spoke reassuringly.&#160;<br/>“It is just a question of time,” he said. “All a&#160;matter of routine. This poor conductor, he seems&#160;<br/>
to have had a busy night—first waking you and then answering bells.”&#160;<br/>
“It was not &#160;the same&#160;conductor who woke&#160;me, Monsieur. It was another one.”&#160;<br/>“Ah! another one! Had you seen him&#160;before?”&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Ah!—do you think you would recognise him&#160;if you saw him?”&#160;<br/>“I think so, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>Poirot murmured something in M. Bouc’s ear. The latter got up and went to the door to give&#160;<br/>
an order.&#160;<br/>
Poirot was continuing his questions in an easy, friendly manner.&#160;<br/>“Have you ever been to America, Fräulein Schmidt?”&#160;<br/>“Never, Monsieur. It must be a fine country.”&#160;<br/>“You have heard, perhaps, who this man who was&#160;killed really was—that he was responsible&#160;<br/>
for the death&#160;of&#160;a little child?”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, I have heard, Monsieur. It was abominable—wicked. The good God should not allow&#160;<br/>
such things. We are not so wicked as that in Germany.”&#160;<br/>
Tears had come into the woman’s eyes.&#160;Her strong, motherly soul was moved.&#160;<br/>“It was an abominable crime,” said Poirot gravely.&#160;<br/>He drew a scrap of cambric from&#160;his pocket and handed it to her.&#160;<br/>“Is this your handkerchief, Fräulein Schmidt?”&#160;<br/>There was a moment’s silence as the woman examined it. She looked up after a minute. The&#160;<br/>
colour had mounted a&#160;little in her face.&#160;<br/>
“Ah! no, indeed. It is not mine, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“It has the initial H, you see. That is why I thought it was yours.”&#160;<br/>“Ah! Monsieur, it is a lady’s handkerchief, that. A very expensive handkerchief. Embroidered&#160;<br/>
by hand. It comes from&#160;Paris, I should say.”&#160;<br/>
“It is not yours and you&#160;do not know whose it is?”&#160;<br/>“I?&#160;Oh! no, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>Of the three listening, only&#160;Poirot caught the nuance of&#160;hesitation in the reply.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

M. Bouc whispered in his ear. Poirot nodded and said to the woman:&#160;<br/>“The three sleeping-car attendants&#160;are coming in. Will you be so kind&#160;as to tell me&#160;which is&#160;<br/>
the one you met last night as you were&#160;going with the rug to the Princess?”&#160;<br/>
The three men entered. Pierre&#160;Michel, the big blond conductor of the Athens-Paris coach, and&#160;<br/>
the stout burly conductor&#160;of the Bucharest one.&#160;<br/>
Hildegarde Schmidt looked at them&#160;and immediately shook her head.&#160;<br/>“No, Monsieur,” she said. “None of these is the man I saw last night.”&#160;<br/>“But these are the only conductors on&#160;the train. You must be mistaken.”&#160;<br/>“I am quite sure, Monsieur. These are all tall,&#160;big men. The&#160;one I saw was small and dark. He&#160;<br/>
had a little moustache. His voice when he said ‘<i>Pardon</i>’ was weak, like a woman’s. Indeed, I&#160;<br/>remember him very well, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>

<b>SUMMARY OF THE PASSENGERS’ EVIDENCE&#160;</b><br/>
“A small dark man with a womanish voice,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>
The three conductors and Hildegarde Schmidt had been dismissed.&#160;<br/>M. Bouc made a despairing gesture. “But I&#160;understand nothing—but nothing, of all of this!&#160;<br/>
The enemy that this Ratchett spoke of, he was then on the train after all? But where is he now?&#160;<br/>How can he have vanished into thin air?&#160;My&#160;head, it whirls. Say something, then, my friend, I&#160;<br/>implore you. Show me how the impossible can be possible!”&#160;<br/>
“It is a good phrase that,” said&#160;Poirot. “The impossible cannot&#160;have happened, therefore the&#160;<br/>
impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.”&#160;<br/>
“Explain to me, then, quickly, what actually happened&#160;on the train last night.”&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;not a magician,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>. I am, like you, a very puzzled man. This&#160;affair advances in a&#160;<br/>
very strange manner.”&#160;<br/>
“It does not advance at all. It stays where it was.”&#160;<br/>Poirot shook his head. “No, that&#160;is not true. We&#160;are more advanced. We&#160;know certain things.&#160;<br/>
We have heard the evidence of the passengers.”&#160;<br/>
“And what has that told us?&#160;Nothing at all.”&#160;<br/>“I would not say that, my&#160;friend.”&#160;<br/>“I exaggerate, perhaps. The American Hardman, and the German maid—yes, they have added&#160;<br/>
something to our knowledge. That is to say, they have made the whole business more&#160;<br/>unintelligible than it was.”&#160;<br/>
“No, no, no,” said Poirot soothingly.&#160;<br/>M. Bouc turned upon him. “Speak, then, let&#160;us hear the wisdom&#160;of Hercule Poirot.”&#160;<br/>“Did I not tell you that I was, like you, a very puzzled man?&#160;But at least we can face our&#160;<br/>
problem. We can arrange such facts as&#160;we have with order and method.”&#160;<br/>
“Pray continue, Monsieur,”&#160;said Dr. Constantine.&#160;<br/>Poirot cleared his throat and straightened a piece&#160;of&#160;blotting-paper.&#160;<br/>“Let us review the case as it stands at this moment. First, there are certain indisputable facts.&#160;<br/>
This man, Ratchett or Cassetti, was stabbed in twelve places and died last night. That is fact&#160;<br/>one.”&#160;<br/>
“I grant it you—I grant it,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>,” said M. Bouc with a gesture of irony.&#160;<br/>Hercule Poirot was not at all put out. He continued calmly.&#160;<br/>“I will pass&#160;over for the moment certain rather&#160;peculiar appearances which Dr. Constantine&#160;<br/>
and I have already discussed together.&#160;I will come&#160;to them&#160;presently. The next fact of&#160;<br/>importance, to my&#160;mind, is the&#160;<i>time</i>&#160;of&#160;the crime.”&#160;<br/>
“That, again,&#160;is one of&#160;the few things we&#160;do know,” said M. Bouc. “The crime was committed&#160;<br/>
at a quarter past one this&#160;morning. Everything goes to show that that was so.”&#160;<br/>
“Not&#160;<i>everything</i>. You exaggerate. There is, certainly, a fair amount of evidence to support that&#160;<br/>
view.”&#160;<br/>
“I am&#160;glad you admit that at least.”&#160;<br/>Poirot went on calmly, unperturbed by the interruption. “We have before us three&#160;<br/>
possibilities.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“(1)—that the crime was committed, as you say, at&#160;a quarter past one. This is supported by the&#160;<br/>
evidence of the watch, by the&#160;evidence of Mrs. Hubbard, and by&#160;the evidence of the German&#160;<br/>woman, Hildegarde Schmidt. It agrees&#160;with the evidence of&#160;Dr. Constantine.&#160;<br/>
“(2)—that the crime was committed&#160;<i>later</i>, and that the evidence of the watch was deliberately&#160;<br/>
faked in order to mislead.&#160;<br/>
“(3)—that the crime was committed&#160;<i>earlier</i>, and the evidence faked for&#160;the same&#160;reason as&#160;<br/>
above.&#160;<br/>
“Now if we accept possibility (1) as the most likely to have&#160;occurred, and the one supported&#160;<br/>
by most evidence, we must also accept certain facts arising&#160;from&#160;it. If&#160;the crime was committed&#160;<br/>at a quarter past one, the murderer cannot have left the train, and the questions arise: Where is&#160;<br/>he?&#160;And&#160;<i>who</i>&#160;is he?&#160;<br/>
“To begin with, let us examine the evidence carefully. We first hear&#160;of&#160;the existence of&#160;this&#160;<br/>
man—the small dark man with a womanish&#160;voice—from the man Hardman. He says that&#160;<br/>Ratchett told him&#160;of this person and employed him&#160;to watch out for the man. There is no&#160;<br/><i>evidence</i>&#160;to support this; we have only Hardman’s word&#160;for it. Let us next examine the question:&#160;<br/>Is Hardman the person he pretends to be an&#160;operative of a New York detective agency?&#160;<br/>
“What to my mind is so interesting in this case&#160;is that we have none of the facilities afforded&#160;<br/>
to the police. We&#160;cannot investigate the&#160;<i>bona fides&#160;</i>of any of these people. We&#160;have to rely solely&#160;<br/>on deduction. That, to me, makes the matter very&#160;much more interesting. There is no routine&#160;<br/>work. It is all a matter of the intellect. I ask myself: Can we accept Hardman’s account of&#160;<br/>himself? I make my&#160;decision and&#160;I answer&#160;‘Yes.’ I am&#160;of the opinion that we&#160;<i>can</i>&#160;accept&#160;<br/>Hardman’s account of himself.”&#160;<br/>
“You rely on the intuition?&#160;What the Americans call ‘the hunch’?”&#160;asked Dr. Constantine.&#160;<br/>“Not at all. I regard the probabilities.&#160;Hardman is travelling with&#160;a&#160;false&#160;passport—that will at&#160;<br/>
once make him&#160;an object of suspicion. The first thing that the police will do when they do arrive&#160;<br/>upon the scene is to detain Hardman and cable as to&#160;whether his account of himself is true. In the&#160;<br/>case of many of the passengers, to establish their&#160;<i>bona fides&#160;</i>will be&#160;difficult; in&#160;most cases&#160;it will&#160;<br/>probably not be attempted, especially&#160;since there seems&#160;nothing in the way of&#160;suspicion attaching&#160;<br/>to them. But in Hardman’s case it is&#160;simple. Either he is the person he represents himself to be,&#160;<br/>or he is not. Therefore I say that&#160;all will prove to&#160;be in order.”&#160;<br/>
“You acquit him&#160;of suspicion?”&#160;<br/>“Not at all. You misunderstand me. For all&#160;I know, any American detective might&#160;have his&#160;<br/>
own private reasons for wishing to&#160;murder Ratchett.&#160;No, what I&#160;am&#160;saying is that I think we&#160;<i>can</i>&#160;<br/>accept Hardman’s own account of&#160;<i>himself</i>. This story, then, that he&#160;tells of&#160;Ratchett’s seeking&#160;<br/>him out and employing him&#160;is not unlikely,&#160;and is most probably—though not of course&#160;<br/>certainly—true. If&#160;we are&#160;going to accept it as true, we must see if&#160;there is&#160;any confirmation of&#160;it.&#160;<br/>We find it in&#160;rather&#160;an unlikely place—in the evidence of Hildegarde Schmidt. Her description of&#160;<br/>the man she saw in Wagon Lit uniform&#160;tallies exactly. Is there any further confirmation of&#160;these&#160;<br/>two stories? There is. There is the button that&#160;Mrs. Hubbard found in her compartment. And&#160;<br/>there is also another corroborating statement which you may not have noticed.”&#160;<br/>
“What is that?”&#160;<br/>“The fact that both Colonel&#160;Arbuthnot and Hector MacQueen mention that the conductor&#160;<br/>
passed their carriage. They attached no&#160;importance to the fact, but, Messieurs,&#160;<i>Pierre Michel has&#160;<br/>declared that he did not leave his&#160;seat except on certain specified occasions</i>—none of which&#160;<br/>would take him&#160;down to the far&#160;end of the coach past the compartment in which Arbuthnot and&#160;<br/>MacQueen were sitting.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
87<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=88></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Therefore this story, the story of a small dark&#160;man&#160;with&#160;a&#160;womanish&#160;voice dressed in Wagon&#160;<br/>
Lit uniform, rests on the testimony, direct&#160;or indirect, of&#160;four witnesses.”&#160;<br/>
“One small point,” said Dr. Constantine. “If Hildegarde Schmidt’s story is true, how is it that&#160;<br/>
the real conductor did not mention having seen her when he came to answer Mrs. Hubbard’s&#160;<br/>bell?”&#160;<br/>
“That is explained, I think. When he arrived to&#160;answer Mrs. Hubbard, the maid was in with&#160;<br/>
her mistress.&#160;When she finally returned to her own compartment, the conductor was in with Mrs.&#160;<br/>Hubbard.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc had been waiting with difficulty until they had finished.&#160;<br/>“Yes, yes, my friend,” he said impatiently to&#160;Poirot. “But whilst I&#160;admire your caution, your&#160;<br/>
method of advancing a step at a&#160;time, I submit that you have not yet touched the point at issue.&#160;<br/>We are all agreed that this&#160;person exists. The point is,&#160;<i>where did he go</i>?”&#160;<br/>
Poirot shook his head reprovingly.&#160;<br/>“You are in&#160;error. You are inclined&#160;to put the&#160;cart before&#160;the horse. Before I ask myself,&#160;<br/>
‘<i>Where did this man vanish to</i>?’ I ask myself, ‘<i>Did such a man really exist</i>?’&#160;Because, you see, if&#160;<br/>the man were an invention—a fabrication—how much&#160;easier to make him&#160;disappear! So I try to&#160;<br/>establish first that&#160;there really&#160;<i>is</i>&#160;such a flesh-and-blood person.”&#160;<br/>
“And having arrived at the fact that there is—<i>eh bien</i>, where is he now?”&#160;<br/>“There are only two answers to that,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>. Either he is still hidden on the train in a place&#160;<br/>
of such extraordinary ingenuity that we cannot even&#160;think of&#160;it; or else he is, as one might say,&#160;<br/><i>two persons</i>. That is, he is both himself—the man feared by M. Ratchett—and a passenger on the&#160;<br/>train so well disguised that M.&#160;Ratchett did not recognise him.”&#160;<br/>
“It is an idea, that,”&#160;said&#160;M. Bouc, his face&#160;lighting up. Then it clouded over again. “But there&#160;<br/>
is one objection—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot took the words out of his mouth.&#160;<br/>“The height of the man. It is&#160;that you would say? With the exception of Mr. Ratchett’s valet,&#160;<br/>
all the passengers are big men—the Italian, Colonel Arbuthnot, Hector MacQueen, Count&#160;<br/>Andrenyi. Well, that leaves us the valet—not&#160;a very likely supposition. But there is another&#160;<br/>possibility. Remember the ‘womanish’ voice. That&#160;gives us&#160;a choice of alternatives. The man&#160;<br/>may be disguised as a woman, or,&#160;alternatively,&#160;he may actually&#160;<i>be</i>&#160;a woman. A tall woman&#160;<br/>dressed in men’s clothes would look small.”&#160;<br/>
“But surely Ratchett would have known—”&#160;<br/>“Perhaps he&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;know. Perhaps, already, this woman had attempted his life, wearing a mares&#160;<br/>
clothes the better to accomplish her purpose. Ratchett may have guessed that she would use the&#160;<br/>same trick again, so he tells Hardman to look&#160;for a man. But he mentions, however, a womanish&#160;<br/>voice.”&#160;<br/>
“It is a possibility,”&#160;said M. Bouc. “But—”&#160;<br/>“Listen, my&#160;friend, I think that I should now tell you of certain inconsistencies noticed by Dr.&#160;<br/>
Constantine.”&#160;<br/>
He retailed at length the&#160;conclusions&#160;that he&#160;and the doctor had arrived at together from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
nature of the dead man’s wounds. M. Bouc groaned and held his head again. “I know,” said&#160;<br/>Poirot sympathetically. “I know exactly how&#160;you feel. The head spins, does it not?”&#160;<br/>
“The whole thing is a fantasy!” cried M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Exactly. It is absurd—improbable—it cannot be.&#160;So I myself have said. And yet, my friend,&#160;<br/>
<i>there it is</i>! One cannot escape from&#160;the facts.”&#160;<br/>
“It is madness!”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“Is it not?&#160;It is so mad, my friend, that sometimes&#160;I am&#160;haunted by the sensation that really it&#160;<br/>
must be very simple. ... But that is&#160;only one of my ‘little ideas’!”&#160;<br/>
“Two murderers,” groaned M. Bouc. “And on the Orient Express—”&#160;<br/>The thought almost made him&#160;weep.&#160;<br/>“And now let us make the fantasy more fantastic,” said Poirot cheerfully. “Last night on the&#160;<br/>
train, there are two mysterious strangers. There is the Wagon Lit attendant answering to the&#160;<br/>description given us by M. Hardman, and seen&#160;by Hildegarde Schmidt, Colonel Arbuthnot and&#160;<br/>M. MacQueen. There is also&#160;a woman in a red kimono—a tall slim&#160;woman, seen by Pierre&#160;<br/>Michel, Miss Debenham, M. MacQueen and&#160;myself (and smelt, I may say, by Colonel&#160;<br/>Arbuthnot!). Who was she? No one on the train admits to having a scarlet kimono. She, too, has&#160;<br/>vanished. Was she one and the same&#160;with the spurious Wagon Lit attendant?&#160;Or was she some&#160;<br/>quite distinct personality? Where are they, these two?&#160;And incidentally, where are the Wagon Lit&#160;<br/>uniform&#160;and the scarlet kimono?”&#160;<br/>
“Ah! that is something definite.” M. Bouc&#160;sprang up eagerly. “We&#160;must search all the&#160;<br/>
passengers’ luggage. Yes, that will be something.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot rose also. “I will make a prophecy,” he said.&#160;<br/>“You know where they are?”&#160;<br/>“I have a little idea.”&#160;<br/>“Where, then?”&#160;<br/>“You will find the scarlet kimono in&#160;the baggage&#160;of one&#160;of the men, and you will find the&#160;<br/>
uniform&#160;of the Wagon Lit conductor in the baggage of Hildegarde Schmidt.”&#160;<br/>
“Hildegarde Schmidt?&#160;You think—”&#160;<br/>“Not what you are thinking. I will&#160;put it like this. If Hildegarde&#160;Schmidt is guilty, the uniform&#160;<br/>
may be found in her baggage. But if she is innocent, it&#160;<i>certainly</i>&#160;will be.”&#160;<br/>
“But how—” began M. Bouc and stopped. “What is&#160;this noise that approaches?”&#160;he cried. “It&#160;<br/>
resembles a locomotive in motion.”&#160;<br/>
The noise drew nearer. It consisted of&#160;shrill cries and protests in a woman’s voice. The door at&#160;<br/>
the end of the dining-car burst&#160;open. Mrs. Hubbard burst in.&#160;<br/>
“It’s too horrible!” she cried.&#160;It’s just too horrible. In&#160;my sponge-bag. My sponge-bag! A&#160;<br/>
great knife—all over blood?”&#160;<br/>
And suddenly toppling forward, she fainted heavily on M. Bouc’s shoulder.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE WEAPON&#160;</b><br/>
With&#160;more vigour than chivalry, A Bouc deposited&#160;the fainting lady with her head on the table.&#160;<br/>Dr. Constantine yelled for one of the restaurant attendants, who came at a run.&#160;<br/>
“Keep her head so,” said the&#160;doctor. “If she revives give her a little cognac. You understand?”&#160;<br/>Then he hurried off after the other two. His interest lay wholly in the crime—swooning&#160;<br/>
middle-aged ladies did not interest him at all.&#160;<br/>
It is possible that Mrs. Hubbard&#160;revived rather more quickly by&#160;these methods than she might&#160;<br/>
otherwise have done. A few minutes later she was sitting up, sipping cognac from&#160;a glass&#160;<br/>proffered by the attendant, and talking once more.&#160;<br/>
“I just can’t tell you how terrible it was! I don’t suppose anybody on this train can understand&#160;<br/>
my feelings. I’ve always been very, very sensitive ever since I was a child. The mere sight of&#160;<br/>blood—<i>ugh</i>! Why, even now I get faint when I think about it!”&#160;<br/>
The attendant proffered the glass again. “<i>Encore un peu, Madame</i>?”&#160;<br/>“D’you think I’d better? I’m&#160;a lifelong teetotaller.&#160;I never touch spirits&#160;or wine at any time.&#160;<br/>
All my&#160;family are abstainers. Still,&#160;perhaps as this is only medicinal—”&#160;<br/>
She sipped once more.&#160;<br/>In the meantime Poirot and M. Bouc, closely followed by Dr. Constantine, had hurried out of&#160;<br/>
the restaurant car and along the corridor of&#160;the Stamboul coach towards Mrs. Hubbard’s&#160;<br/>compartment.&#160;<br/>
Every traveller on the train seemed to be congregated outside the door. The conductor, a&#160;<br/>
harassed look on his face, was keeping them&#160;back.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Mais il n’y a rien à voir</i>,” he said, and repeated the sentiment in several other languages.&#160;<br/>“Let me&#160;pass if you please,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>Squeezing his rotundity past the&#160;obstructing passengers he&#160;entered the compartment, Poirot&#160;<br/>
close behind him.&#160;<br/>
“I am&#160;glad you have come, Monsieur,” said the conductor with a sigh of&#160;relief. “Everyone has&#160;<br/>
been trying to enter. The American lady—such screams as she gave—<i>ma&#160;foi</i>, I thought she too&#160;<br/>had been murdered! I came&#160;at a run, and there she was screaming like a mad woman; and she&#160;<br/>cried out that she must fetch you,&#160;and she departed screeching at the top of&#160;her voice and telling&#160;<br/>everybody whose carriage she passed what had occurred.”&#160;<br/>
He added, with a gesture of the hand: “<i>It</i>&#160;is in there, Monsieur. I have not touched it.”&#160;<br/>Hanging on the handle of the door that gave&#160;access to the next compartment was a large-<br/>
checked rubber sponge-bag. Below it on the floor, just where it had fallen from&#160;Mrs. Hubbard’s&#160;<br/>hand, was a straight-bladed dagger—a cheap affair, sham&#160;Oriental with an embossed hilt and a&#160;<br/>tapering blade. The blade was stained with patches of what looked like rust.&#160;<br/>
Poirot picked it up delicately.&#160;<br/>“Yes,” he murmured. “There is no mistake. Here is our missing weapon all right—eh,&#160;<br/>
doctor?”&#160;<br/>
The doctor examined it.&#160;<br/>“You need not be so careful,” said Poirot. “There will be no&#160;fingerprints on it save those of&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard.” Constantine’s examination did not take long.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
90<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=91></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“It is the weapon all right,” he said. “It would account for any of the wounds.”&#160;<br/>“I implore you, my friend, do not say that!” The doctor&#160;looked astonished.&#160;<br/>“Already we are heavily overburdened by coincidence. Two people decided to stab M.&#160;<br/>
Ratchett last night. It is too much of a good thing that both of them&#160;should select the same&#160;<br/>weapon.”&#160;<br/>
“As, to that, the coincidence is not perhaps so&#160;great as it seems,” said the doctor. “Thousands&#160;<br/>
of these sham Eastern daggers are made and shipped to the bazaars of Constantinople.”&#160;<br/>
“You console me&#160;a little,&#160;but&#160;only a little,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>He looked thoughtfully at the door in front of&#160;him, then, lifting off the sponge-bag, he tried&#160;<br/>
the handle. The door did not budge. About a foot above the handle was the door bolt. Poirot drew&#160;<br/>it back and tried again, but still the door remained fast.&#160;<br/>
“We locked it from&#160;the other side,&#160;you remember,” said the doctor.&#160;<br/>“That is true,” said Poirot absently. He seemed&#160;to be thinking about&#160;something else. His brow&#160;<br/>
was furrowed as though in perplexity.&#160;<br/>
“It agrees, does it not?” said M.&#160;Bouc. “The man passes through this carriage. As he shuts the&#160;<br/>
communicating door behind him&#160;he feels the&#160;sponge-bag. A thought comes to him&#160;and he&#160;<br/>quickly slips the blood-stained knife inside. Then, all unwitting that&#160;he has awakened Mrs.&#160;<br/>Hubbard, he slips out through the&#160;other door into the corridor.”&#160;<br/>
“As you say,” murmured Poirot. “That is how it&#160;must have happened.” But the puzzled look&#160;<br/>
did not leave his face.&#160;<br/>
“But what is it?”&#160;demanded M. Bouc. “There is&#160;something, is there not, that does not satisfy&#160;<br/>
you?”&#160;<br/>
Poirot darted a quick took at him.&#160;<br/>“The same&#160;point does not strike you? No,&#160;evidently not. Well, it is a small matter.”&#160;<br/>The conductor looked into the carriage.&#160;“The American lady is coming back.”&#160;<br/>Dr. Constantine looked rather guilty. He had, he felt, treated Mrs. Hubbard rather cavalierly.&#160;<br/>
But she had no reproaches for him.&#160;Her energies were concentrated on another matter.&#160;<br/>
“I’m&#160;going to say one thing right out,” she said&#160;breathlessly as she arrived in the doorway.&#160;<br/>
“I’m&#160;not going on any longer in this compartment! Why, I wouldn’t&#160;sleep in it to-night if you&#160;<br/>paid me&#160;a million dollars.”&#160;<br/>
“But, Madame—”&#160;<br/>“I know what you are going to say, and I’m telling you right now that I won’t do any such&#160;<br/>
thing! Why, I’d rather sit up all night in the&#160;corridor.” She began to&#160;cry. “Oh, if my daughter&#160;<br/>could only know—if she could see me&#160;now, why—”&#160;<br/>
Poirot interrupted firmly.&#160;<br/>“You misunderstand, Madame. Your demand is most reasonable. Your baggage shall be&#160;<br/>
changed at once to another compartment.”&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard lowered her handkerchief. “is that so?&#160;Oh! I feel&#160;better right away. But surely&#160;<br/>
it’s all full, unless one of the gentlemen—”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc spoke.&#160;<br/>“Your baggage, Madame, shall be moved out of&#160;this coach altogether. You shall have a&#160;<br/>
compartment in the next coach,&#160;which was put on at Belgrade.”&#160;<br/>
“Why, that’s splendid. I’m&#160;not an extra nervous&#160;woman, but to sleep in that compartment next&#160;<br/>
door to a dead man!” She shivered. “It would drive me&#160;plumb crazy.”&#160;<br/>
“Michel,” called M. Bouc. “Move this baggage into a vacant compartment in the Athens-Paris&#160;<br/>
coach.”&#160;<br/>

“Yes, Monsieur. The same&#160;one as this—the No. 3?”&#160;<br/>“No,” said Poirot before his friend could reply. “I think it would be better&#160;for Madame to have&#160;<br/>
a different number altogether. The No. 12, for instance.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Bien, Monsieur</i>.”&#160;<br/>The conductor seized the luggage. Mrs. Hubbard turned gratefully to Poirot.&#160;<br/>“That’s very kind and delicate of&#160;you. I appreciate it, I assure you.”&#160;<br/>“Do not mention it, Madame. We will come&#160;with you and see you comfortably installed.”&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard was escorted by the three men&#160;to her new home. She looked round her happily.&#160;<br/>
“This is fine.”&#160;<br/>
“It suits you, Madame?&#160;It is, you see, exactly like the compartment you have left.”&#160;<br/>“That’s so—only it faces the other way. But that&#160;doesn’t matter, for these trains go first one&#160;<br/>
way and then the other. I said to my daughter, ‘I&#160;want a carriage facing the engine.’ and she said,&#160;<br/>‘Why, Mamma, that’ll be no good to you, for if you go to sleep one way, when you wake up, the&#160;<br/>train’s going the other!’ And it was quite true what she said. Why, last evening we&#160;went into&#160;<br/>Belgrade one way and out the other.”&#160;<br/>
“At any rate, Madame, you are&#160;quite happy and contented now?”&#160;<br/>“Well, no, I wouldn’t say that.&#160;Here we are stuck in a snowdrift and nobody doing anything&#160;<br/>
about it, and my boat sailing the day after to-morrow.”&#160;<br/>
“Madame,” said M. Bouc, “we are all in the same&#160;case—every one of us.”&#160;<br/>“Well, that’s true,” admitted Mrs. Hubbard. “But nobody else has had a murderer walking&#160;<br/>
right through her compartment in the middle of the night.&#160;<br/>
“What still puzzles me, Madame,” said Poirot,&#160;“is how the man got into your compartment if&#160;<br/>
the communicating door was bolted as&#160;you say. You are sure that it&#160;<i>was</i>&#160;bolted?”&#160;<br/>
“Why, the Swedish lady tried it before my eyes.”&#160;<br/>“Let us just reconstruct that little scene.&#160;You were&#160;lying in your bunk—so—and you could not&#160;<br/>
see for yourself, you say?”&#160;<br/>
“No, because&#160;of the sponge-bag. Oh! my, I shall have to get a new sponge-bag. It makes me&#160;<br/>
feel sick at my stomach to look at this one.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot picked up the sponge-bag and hung it on the handle of the communicating door into the&#160;<br/>
next carriage.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Précisément</i>. I see,” he said. “The bolt is just underneath the handle—the sponge-bag masks&#160;<br/>
it. You could not see from where you were lying whether the bolt was turned or not.”&#160;<br/>
“Why, that’s just what I’ve been telling you!”&#160;<br/>“And the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson, stood so, between you and the door. She tried it and&#160;<br/>
told you it was bolted.”&#160;<br/>
“That’s so.”&#160;<br/>“All the same, Madame, she may have made an error. You see what I mean.” Poirot seemed&#160;<br/>
anxious to explain. “The bolt is just a projection of&#160;metal—so.&#160;When&#160;it is turned to the right, the&#160;<br/>door is locked. When it is left straight, the door&#160;is unlocked. Possibly she merely tried the door,&#160;<br/>and as it was locked on the other side she may&#160;have assumed that it was locked on your side.”&#160;<br/>
“Well, I guess that would be&#160;rather stupid of her.”&#160;<br/>“Madame, the most kind, the most amiable, are not always the cleverest.”&#160;<br/>“That’s so, of course.”&#160;<br/>“By the way, Madame, did you travel out to Smyrna this way?”&#160;<br/>“No. I sailed right to Stamboul, and a friend of my daughter’s, Mr.&#160;Johnson (a perfectly lovely&#160;<br/>
man, I’d like to have you know him), met me&#160;and showed me&#160;all round Stamboul. But it was a&#160;<br/>

very disappointing city—all tumbling down; and as for those mosques, and putting on those&#160;<br/>great shuffling things over your shoes—where was I?”&#160;<br/>
“You were saying that Mr. Johnson met you.”&#160;<br/>“That’s so, and he saw me&#160;on board a French Messageries boat for Smyrna, and my&#160;<br/>
daughter’s husband was waiting right on the quay. What he’ll say when he hears about all this!&#160;<br/>My daughter said this would be just the safest, easiest way imaginable. ‘You just sit in your&#160;<br/>carriage,’ she said, ‘and you land right in Parrus, and there the American Express will meet you.’&#160;<br/>And, oh, dear, what am&#160;I to do about cancelling my&#160;steamship&#160;passage?&#160;I ought to let them&#160;know.&#160;<br/>I can’t possibly make it now. This is&#160;just too terrible—”&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard showed signs of tears once more.&#160;<br/>Poirot, who had been fidgeting&#160;slightly, seized his opportunity.&#160;<br/>“You have had a shock, Madame. The restaurant&#160;attendant shall be instructed to bring you&#160;<br/>
along some&#160;tea and some&#160;biscuits.”&#160;<br/>
“I don’t know that I’m&#160;so&#160;set on tea,” said Mrs.&#160;Hubbard tearfully. “That’s more an English&#160;<br/>
habit.”&#160;<br/>
“Coffee, then, Madame. You need some&#160;stimulant—”&#160;<br/>“That cognac’s made my&#160;head feel mighty funny. I think I would like some coffee.”&#160;<br/>“Excellent. You must revive your forces.”&#160;<br/>“My, what a funny expression!”&#160;<br/>“But first, Madame, a little&#160;matter of routine. You permit that I make&#160;a search of your&#160;<br/>
baggage!”&#160;<br/>
“What for?”&#160;<br/>“We are about to commence a search of all the passengers’ luggage. I do not want to remind&#160;<br/>
you of an unpleasant experience,&#160;but your sponge-bag—remember.”&#160;<br/>
“Mercy! Perhaps you’d better! I just&#160;couldn’t bear to get any more surprises of that kind.”&#160;<br/>The examination was quickly over. Mrs. Hubbard was travelling with the minimum&#160;of&#160;<br/>
luggage—a hat-box, a cheap suitcase, and a well-burdened travelling bag. The contents of all&#160;<br/>three were simple and straightforward, and the&#160;examination would not have taken more than a&#160;<br/>couple of minutes had not Mrs. Hubbard delayed&#160;matters by insisting on due attention being paid&#160;<br/>to photographs of “my daughter”&#160;and of two rather ugly children—“my daughter’s children.&#160;<br/>Aren’t they cunning?”&#160;<br/>

<b>THE EVIDENCE OF THE PASSENGERS’ LUGGAGE&#160;</b><br/>
Having delivered himself of various polite insincerities, and having told&#160;Mrs. Hubbard that he&#160;<br/>would order coffee to be&#160;brought to&#160;her, Poirot&#160;was able to take his leave accompanied by his&#160;<br/>two friends.&#160;<br/>
“Well, we have made a start and drawn, a blank,” observed M. Bouc. “Whom shall we attack&#160;<br/>
next?”&#160;<br/>
“It would be simplest, I think, just to proceed&#160;along the train, carriage&#160;by carriage. That means&#160;<br/>
that we start with No. 16—the amiable Mr. Hardman.”&#160;<br/>
Mr. Hardman, who was smoking a cigar, welcomed them&#160;affably.&#160;<br/>“Come right in, gentlemen. That is, if it’s humanly&#160;possible. It’s just a mite cramped in here&#160;<br/>
for a party.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc explained the object of their visit, and the big detective nodded comprehendingly.&#160;<br/>“That’s O.K. To tell the truth I’ve been wondering you didn’t get down to it sooner. Here are&#160;<br/>
my keys, gentlemen, and if you like to search&#160;my pockets too, why, you’re welcome. Shall I&#160;<br/>reach the grips down for you?”&#160;<br/>
“The conductor will do that. Michel!”&#160;<br/>The contents of Mr. Hardman’s two “grips” were&#160;soon examined and passed. They contained,&#160;<br/>
perhaps, an undue proportion of spirituous liquor. Mr. Hardman winked.&#160;<br/>
“It’s not often they search your grips at the frontiers—not if&#160;you fix the conductor. I handed&#160;<br/>
out a wad of Turkish notes right away, and there’s been no trouble so far.”&#160;<br/>
“And at Paris?”&#160;<br/>Mr. Hardman winked again. “By the time I get to&#160;Paris,” he said, “what’s left over of this&#160;<br/>
little lot will go into a bottle labelled hairwash.”&#160;<br/>
“You are not a believer in Prohibition, Monsieur Hardman,” said M. Bouc with a smile.&#160;<br/>“Well,” said Hardman, “I&#160;can’t say Prohibition has ever worried me&#160;any.”&#160;<br/>“Ah!” said M. Bouc. “The speakeasy.” He&#160;pronounced the word with&#160;care, savouring it.&#160;<br/>
“Your American terms are so quaint, so expressive,” he said.&#160;<br/>
“Me, I would much like to go&#160;to America,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>“You’d learn a few go-ahead methods over there,” said Hardman. “Europe needs waking up.&#160;<br/>
She’s half asleep.”&#160;<br/>
“It is true that America is the country of progress,” agreed Poirot.&#160;“There is&#160;much that I&#160;<br/>
admire about Americans. Only—I am&#160;perhaps old-fashioned—but me, I find the American&#160;<br/>women less charming than my&#160;own countrywomen.&#160;The French or the Belgian girl, coquettish,&#160;<br/>charming—I think there is no one to touch her.”&#160;<br/>
Hardman turned away to peer out at the snow for a minute.&#160;<br/>“Perhaps you’re right, M. Poirot,” he said. “But I guess every&#160;nation likes its own girls best.”&#160;<br/>
He blinked as though the snow hurt his eyes.&#160;<br/>
“Kind of dazzling, isn’t it?”&#160;he remarked. “Say, gentlemen, this business is getting on my&#160;<br/>
nerves. Murder and the snow and all. And nothing&#160;<i>doing</i>. Just hanging about and killing time. I’d&#160;<br/>like to get busy after someone or something.”&#160;<br/>
“The true Western spirit of hustle,” said Poirot&#160;with a smile.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

The conductor replaced the bags and they moved on to the next compartment. Colonel&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot was sitting in a corner smoking a pipe and reading a magazine.&#160;<br/>
Poirot explained their errand. The Colonel&#160;made no demur. He had two heavy leather&#160;<br/>
suitcases.&#160;<br/>
“The rest of my kit has gone by long sea,” he explained.&#160;<br/>Like most Army&#160;men the Colonel was a neat&#160;packer. The examination of his baggage took&#160;<br/>
only a few minutes. Poirot noted a packet of pipe-cleaners.&#160;<br/>
“You always use the same&#160;kind?” he&#160;asked. “Usually. If I can get ’em.”&#160;<br/>“Ah!” Poirot nodded. These pipe-cleaners corresponded exactly with the one he had found on&#160;<br/>
the floor of the dead man’s compartment.&#160;<br/>
Dr. Constantine remarked as much when&#160;they were out in the corridor again.&#160;<br/>“<i>Tout de même</i>,” murmured Poirot, “I can hardly believe it. It is not&#160;<i>dans son caractère</i>, and&#160;<br/>
when you have said that, you&#160;have said everything.”&#160;<br/>
The door of the next compartment was closed. It&#160;was that occupied by Princess Dragomiroff.&#160;<br/>
They knocked on the door and the Princess’s deep voice called “<i>Entrez</i>!”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc was spokesman. He was very deferential and polite as he explained their errand.&#160;<br/>The Princess listened to him&#160;in silence, her small toad-like face quite impassive.&#160;<br/>“If&#160;it is necessary, Messieurs,” she said quietly when he had finished, “that is all there is to it.&#160;<br/>
My maid has the keys. She will attend&#160;to it with you.”&#160;<br/>
“Does your maid always carry your keys, Madame?”&#160;asked Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Certainly, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“And if, during the night at one of the frontiers,&#160;the customs officials should require a&#160;piece of&#160;<br/>
luggage to be opened?”&#160;<br/>
The old lady shrugged her shoulders. “It is very unlikely. But&#160;in such a case,&#160;the conductor&#160;<br/>
would fetch her.”&#160;<br/>
“You trust her, then, implicitly, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“I have told you so already,” said the Princess quietly. “I do not employ people whom I do not&#160;<br/>
trust.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully.&#160;“Trust is indeed something in&#160;these days. It is perhaps better&#160;<br/>
to have a homely woman whom&#160;one can trust than a more&#160;<i>chic</i>&#160;maid—for example, some smart&#160;<br/>Parisienne.”&#160;<br/>
He saw the dark intelligent eyes come&#160;slowly round and fasten themselves upon his face.&#160;<br/>
“What exactly are you implying, M. Poirot?”&#160;<br/>
“Nothing, Madame. I?&#160;Nothing.”&#160;<br/>“But yes. You think, do you not, that I should&#160;have a smart Frenchwoman to attend to my&#160;<br/>
toilet?”&#160;<br/>
“It would be perhaps more usual, Madame.” She shook her head. “Schmidt&#160;is devoted to me.”&#160;<br/>
Her voice dwelt lingeringly on the words. “Devotion—<i>c’est impayable</i>.”&#160;<br/>
The German woman had arrived with the keys. The Princess spoke to her in her own&#160;<br/>
language, telling her to&#160;open the valises and help&#160;the gentlemen in their search. She herself&#160;<br/>remained in the corridor looking out at the snow,&#160;and Poirot remained with&#160;her, leaving M. Bouc&#160;<br/>to the task of searching the luggage.&#160;<br/>
She regarded him&#160;with a grim&#160;smile.&#160;<br/>“Well, Monsieur, do you not wish to&#160;see what my valises contain?”&#160;<br/>He shook his head. “Madame, it is a formality, that is all.”&#160;<br/>“Are you so sure?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
95<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=96></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“In your case, yes.”&#160;<br/>“And yet I knew and loved Sonia Armstrong. What&#160;do you think, then?&#160;That I would not soil&#160;<br/>
my hands with killing such&#160;<i>canaille</i>&#160;as that man Cassetti?&#160;Well, perhaps you are right.”&#160;<br/>
She was silent a minute or two. Then she said:&#160;<br/>“With such a man as that, do you know what I should have liked to do?&#160;I should have liked to&#160;<br/>
call to my&#160;servants: ‘Flog this man to death and fling him out on the rubbish heap!’ That is the&#160;<br/>way things were done when I was young, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>
Still he did not speak, just listened attentively.&#160;<br/>She looked at him&#160;with a sudden impetuosity. “You&#160;do not say anything, M. Poirot. What is it&#160;<br/>
that you are thinking, I wonder?”&#160;<br/>
He looked at her with a very direct glance.&#160;“I think, Madame, that your strength is in your&#160;<br/>
will—not in your arm.”&#160;<br/>
She glanced down at her thin,&#160;black-clad arms ending in those claw-like&#160;yellow hands with&#160;<br/>
the rings on the fingers.&#160;<br/>
“It is true,” she said. “I have&#160;no strength in these—none. I do not know whether I am sorry or&#160;<br/>
glad.”&#160;<br/>
Then she turned abruptly&#160;back towards her carriage where the maid was busily packing up the&#160;<br/>
cases.&#160;<br/>
The Princess cut short&#160;M. Bouc’s apologies.&#160;<br/>“There is no&#160;need for you to apologise, Monsieur,” she said. “A murder has been committed.&#160;<br/>
Certain actions have to be performed. That is all there is to it.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Vous êtes bien aimable, Madame</i>.”&#160;<br/>She inclined&#160;her head slightly as they departed.&#160;<br/>The doors of the next two carriages were shut. M. Bouc paused and scratched his head.&#160;<br/>“<i>Diable</i>!” he said. “This may be awkward. These are diplomatic passports. Their luggage is&#160;<br/>
exempt.”&#160;<br/>
“From&#160;customs examination, yes. But a murder is different.”&#160;<br/>“I know. All the same—we do not want to have complications.”&#160;<br/>“Do not distress yourself, my friend. The Count&#160;and Countess will be reasonable. See how&#160;<br/>
amiable Princess Dragomiroff was about it.”&#160;<br/>
“She is truly&#160;<i>grande dame</i>. These two are also of the same&#160;position, but the Count impressed&#160;<br/>
me as a man of somewhat truculent disposition. He was not pleased&#160;when you insisted on&#160;<br/>questioning his wife. And this&#160;will annoy him&#160;still further.&#160;Suppose—eh?—we omit them. After&#160;<br/>all, they can have nothing to do with the matter. Why should I stir up needless trouble for&#160;<br/>myself?”&#160;<br/>
“I do not agree with you,” said Poirot. “I feel&#160;sure that Count Andrenyi will be reasonable. At&#160;<br/>
any rate let us make the attempt.”&#160;<br/>
And before M. Bouc could reply, he&#160;rapped sharply on the door of No. 13.&#160;<br/>A voice from within cried “<i>Entrez</i>!”&#160;<br/>The Count was sitting in the corner near the door reading a newspaper. The Countess was&#160;<br/>
curled up in the opposite corner near the window. There was a pillow behind her head and she&#160;<br/>seemed to have been asleep.&#160;<br/>
“Pardon, Monsieur le Comte,” began Poirot. “pray forgive this intrusion. It is that we are&#160;<br/>
making a search of all the baggage&#160;on the&#160;train.&#160;In most cases a&#160;mere formality. But it has&#160;to be&#160;<br/>done. M. Bouc suggests that, as you have a diplomatic passport, you might reasonably claim&#160;to&#160;<br/>be exempt from&#160;such a search.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
96<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=97></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
The Count considered for a moment.&#160;<br/>“Thank you,” he said. “But I do not think that I&#160;care to have an exception made in my case. I&#160;<br/>
should prefer that our baggage should be examined like that of the other passengers.”&#160;<br/>
He turned to his wife. “You do not object, I hope, Elena?”&#160;<br/>“Not at all,” said the Countess without hesitation.&#160;<br/>A rapid and somewhat perfunctory search followed. Poirot seemed to be trying to mask an&#160;<br/>
embarrassment by making various small pointless remarks, such as:&#160;<br/>
“Here is a label all wet on your suitcase, Madame,” as he&#160;lifted down a blue morocco case&#160;<br/>
with initials on it and a coronet.&#160;<br/>
The Countess did not reply to this observation. She seemed, indeed, rather bored by the whole&#160;<br/>
proceeding,&#160;remaining curled up in her corner&#160;and staring dreamily out through&#160;the window&#160;<br/>whilst the men searched her luggage&#160;in the compartment next door.&#160;<br/>
Poirot finished his search by opening the little cupboard above the washbasin and taking a&#160;<br/>
rapid glance at its contents—a sponge, face cream, powder and a small bottle labelled trional.&#160;<br/>
Then with polite remarks on either&#160;side, the search party withdrew.&#160;<br/>Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment, that of the dead man, and Poirot’s own came next.&#160;<br/>They now came&#160;to the second-class carriages. The first one, Nos. 10 and 11, was occupied by&#160;<br/>
Mary Debenham,&#160;who was reading a book, and Greta Ohlsson, who was fast asleep but woke&#160;<br/>with a start at their entrance.&#160;<br/>
Poirot repeated his formula. The Swedish&#160;lady seemed agitated, Mary Debenham&#160;calmly&#160;<br/>
indifferent. He addressed himself to the Swedish lady.&#160;<br/>
“If you permit, Mademoiselle, we will examine your baggage first, and then perhaps you&#160;<br/>
would be so good as to see how the American lady is getting on. We&#160;have moved her into one of&#160;<br/>the carriages in the next coach, but she is still very much upset as the result of her discovery. I&#160;<br/>have ordered coffee to be sent to&#160;her, but I think she is of those to&#160;whom someone to talk to is a&#160;<br/>necessity of the first order.”&#160;<br/>
The good lady was instantly sympathetic. She&#160;would go immediately. It must have been&#160;<br/>
indeed a&#160;terrible shock&#160;to the nerves, and already the poor lady was upset by the journey and&#160;<br/>leaving her daughter. Ah, yes, certainly she would go at once—her case was not locked—and she&#160;<br/>would take with her some&#160;sal ammoniac.&#160;<br/>
She bustled off. Her possessions were soon examined. They were meagre in the extreme. She&#160;<br/>
had evidently not yet noticed the missing wires from&#160;the hat-box.&#160;<br/>
Miss Debenham&#160;had put her book down. She was watching Poirot. When he asked her, she&#160;<br/>
handed over her keys. Then, as he lifted down a case and opened it, she said:&#160;<br/>
“Why did you send her away, M. Poirot?”&#160;<br/>“I, Mademoiselle! Why, to minister to the American lady.”&#160;<br/>“An excellent pretext—but a pretext all the same.”&#160;<br/>“I don’t understand you, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“I think you understand me very well.” She smiled. “You wanted to get me&#160;alone. Wasn’t that&#160;<br/>
it?”&#160;<br/>
“You are putting words into my mouth, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“And ideas into your head? No, I don’t think so. The ideas are already&#160;there. That is right,&#160;<br/>
isn’t it?”&#160;<br/>
“Mademoiselle, we have a proverb—”&#160;<br/>“<i>Qui s’excuse s’accuse</i>—is that what you were&#160;going to say? You must give me&#160;the credit for&#160;<br/>
a certain amount of observation and common sense.&#160;For some&#160;reason or other you have got it&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>

into your head that I know something about this&#160;sordid business—this murder of a man I never&#160;<br/>saw before.”&#160;<br/>
“You are imagining things, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“No, I am&#160;not imagining things at&#160;all. But it seems to&#160;me that&#160;a lot of time is wasted by not&#160;<br/>
speaking the truth—by beating about the bush instead of coming straight out with things.”&#160;<br/>
“And you do not like the waste of time. No, you like to come straight to the point. You like&#160;<br/>
the direct method.&#160;<i>Eh bien</i>, I will give it to you,&#160;the direct method. I will ask you the meaning of&#160;<br/>certain words that I overheard on the journey from&#160;Syria. I had got&#160;out of&#160;the train&#160;to&#160;do what the&#160;<br/>English call ‘stretch the legs’ at the station of Konya. Your voice&#160;and the Colonel’s,&#160;<br/>Mademoiselle, they came to&#160;me out of&#160;the night. You&#160;said&#160;to&#160;him,&#160;‘<i>Not now. Not now. When it’s&#160;<br/>all over. When it’s behind us</i>.’ What&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;you mean by those words, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>
She asked very quietly, “Do you think I meant—murder?”&#160;<br/>“It is I who am&#160;asking you, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>She sighed—was lost a minute in thought. Then, as though rousing herself, she said:&#160;<br/>“Those words had a meaning, Monsieur, but not&#160;one that I can tell you. I can only give you&#160;<br/>
my solemn&#160;word of&#160;honour that I had never set eyes on this&#160;man Ratchett in my&#160;life until I saw&#160;<br/>him&#160;on this train.”&#160;<br/>
“And—you refuse to explain those words?”&#160;<br/>“Yes, if you like to put it that way—I refuse. They had to do with—with a task I had&#160;<br/>
undertaken.”&#160;<br/>
“A task that is now ended?”&#160;<br/>“What do you mean?”&#160;<br/>“It is ended, is it not?”&#160;<br/>“Why should you think so?”&#160;<br/>“Listen, Mademoiselle, I will recall to you another incident. There was a delay to the train on&#160;<br/>
the day we were to reach Stamboul. You were very agitated, Mademoiselle. You, so calm, so&#160;<br/>self-controlled. You lost that calm.”&#160;<br/>
“I did not want to miss my connection.”&#160;<br/>“So you said. But, Mademoiselle, the Orient Express leaves Stamboul every day of the week.&#160;<br/>
Even if you had missed the connection it would only have been a matter&#160;of twenty-four hours’&#160;<br/>delay.”&#160;<br/>
Miss Debenham&#160;for the first time showed signs of losing her temper.&#160;<br/>“You do not seem&#160;to realise that one may have&#160;friends awaiting one’s&#160;arrival in London, and&#160;<br/>
that a day’s delay upsets arrangements and causes a lot of annoyance.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah, it is like that? There are friends awaiting your arrival? You do not want to cause them&#160;<br/>
inconvenience?”&#160;<br/>
“Naturally.”&#160;<br/>“And yet—it is curious—”&#160;<br/>“What is curious?”&#160;<br/>“On this train—again we have a delay. And this&#160;time a more serious delay, since there is no&#160;<br/>
possibility of sending a telegram&#160;to your friends or of getting them&#160;on the long—the long—”&#160;<br/>
“Long distance?&#160;The telephone, you mean.”&#160;<br/>“Ah, yes, the portmanteau call,&#160;as you say in England.”&#160;<br/>Mary Debenham smiled a little in spite of herself. “Trunk call,” she corrected. “Yes, as you&#160;<br/>
say, it is extremely annoying not to be able to&#160;get any word through, either by telephone or by&#160;<br/>telegraph.”&#160;<br/>

“And yet, Mademoiselle,&#160;<i>this</i>&#160;time your manner is quite different. You no longer betray the&#160;<br/>
impatience. You are calm and philosophical.”&#160;<br/>
Mary Debenham&#160;flushed and bit her lip.&#160;She no longer felt inclined to smile.&#160;<br/>“You do not answer, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;sorry. I did not know that&#160;there was anything to answer.”&#160;<br/>“Your change of attitude, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“Don’t you think that you are making rather a fuss about nothing, M. Poirot?”&#160;<br/>Poirot spread out his hands in an apologetic gesture.&#160;<br/>“It is perhaps a fault with us detectives. We expect the behaviour to be always consistent. We&#160;<br/>
do not allow for changes of mood.”&#160;<br/>
Mary Debenham&#160;made no reply.&#160;<br/>“You know Colonel Arbuthnot well, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>He fancied that she was relieved by the change of subject.&#160;<br/>“I met him&#160;for the first time on this journey.”&#160;<br/>“Have you any reason to suspect that he&#160;may have known this man Ratchett?”&#160;<br/>She shook her head decisively. “I&#160;am quite sure he didn’t.”&#160;<br/>“Why are you sure?”&#160;<br/>“By the way he spoke.”&#160;<br/>“And yet, Mademoiselle, we found a pipe-cleaner on the floor of the dead man’s&#160;<br/>
compartment. And Colonel Arbuthnot is the only man on the train who smokes a pipe.”&#160;<br/>
He watched her narrowly, but she displayed&#160;neither surprise nor&#160;emotion, merely said:&#160;<br/>“Nonsense. It’s absurd. Colonel&#160;Arbuthnot is the last man in&#160;the world to be mixed up in a&#160;<br/>
crime—especially a theatrical kind of&#160;crime like this.”&#160;<br/>
It was so much what Poirot himself thought that he found himself on the point of agreeing&#160;<br/>
with her. He&#160;said instead:&#160;<br/>
“I must remind you that you do not know him&#160;very well, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>She shrugged her shoulders. “I know&#160;the type well enough.”&#160;<br/>He said very gently:&#160;<br/>“You still refuse to tell me the meaning&#160;of those words: ‘When it’s behind us’?”&#160;<br/>She replied coldly, “I have nothing more to say.”&#160;<br/>“It does not matter,” said&#160;Hercule Poirot. “I shall find out.”&#160;<br/>He bowed and left the compartment, closing the door after him.&#160;<br/>“Was that wise, my&#160;friend?” asked M. Bouc. “You have put her on her guard—and through&#160;<br/>
her, you have put the Colonel on his guard also.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Mon ami</i>, if you wish to catch a rabbit you put a ferret into the hole, and if the rabbit is&#160;<br/>
there—he runs. That is all I have done.”&#160;<br/>
They entered the compartment of Hildegarde&#160;Schmidt.&#160;<br/>The woman was standing&#160;in readiness,&#160;her face respectful but unemotional.&#160;<br/>Poirot took&#160;a quick glance through the contents of the small case on&#160;the seat. Then he&#160;<br/>
motioned to the attendant to get down the bigger suitcase from the rack.&#160;<br/>
“The keys?”&#160;he said.&#160;<br/>“It is not locked, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>Poirot undid the hasps and lifted the lid.&#160;<br/>“Aha!” he said, and turning to M. Bouc, “You remember what I said?&#160;Look here a little&#160;<br/>
moment!”&#160;<br/>
<i>On the top of the suitcase was a hastily rolled-up brown Wagon Lit uniform</i>.&#160;<br/>

The stolidity of the German woman underwent a sudden change.&#160;<br/>“<i>Ach</i>!” she cried. “That is not mine. I did not put&#160;it there. I have never looked in that case&#160;<br/>
since we left Stamboul. Indeed, indeed, it is true!” She looked from&#160;one&#160;to another of the men&#160;<br/>pleadingly.&#160;<br/>
Poirot took her gently by the arm&#160;and soothed her.&#160;<br/>“No, no, all is well. We believe you. Do not be agitated. I am&#160;sure you did not hide the&#160;<br/>
uniform&#160;there as I am&#160;sure that you are a good cook. See. You&#160;<i>are</i>&#160;a good cook, are you not?”&#160;<br/>
Bewildered,&#160;the woman smiled in spite of&#160;herself,&#160;“Yes, indeed, all my&#160;ladies have said so.&#160;<br/>
I—”&#160;<br/>
She stopped, her mouth open, looking frightened again.&#160;<br/>“No, no,” said Poirot. “I assure you all is well. See, I will tell you&#160;how this happened. This&#160;<br/>
man, the man you saw in Wagon Lit uniform, comes out of the dead man’s compartment. He&#160;<br/>collides with you. That is bad&#160;luck&#160;for him. He&#160;has hoped&#160;that no&#160;one will see him. What to do&#160;<br/>next?&#160;He must get rid of his uniform. It&#160;is now not a safeguard, but a danger.”&#160;<br/>
His glance went to M. Bow and Dr. Constantine, who were listening attentively.&#160;<br/>“There is the snow, you see. The snow which confuses all his plans. Where can he hide these&#160;<br/>
clothes?&#160;All the compartments are full. No, he&#160;passes one whose door is open, showing it to be&#160;<br/>unoccupied. It must be the one belonging to&#160;the&#160;woman with whom&#160;he has just&#160;collided. He slips&#160;<br/>in, removes the uniform&#160;and jams it hurriedly into a suitcase on the rack. It may be some&#160;time&#160;<br/>before it is discovered.”&#160;<br/>
“And then?”&#160;said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“That we must discuss,” Poirot&#160;said with a warning glance.&#160;<br/>He held up the tunic. A button, the third down, was missing. Poirot slipped his hand into the&#160;<br/>
pocket and took out a conductor’s pass-key, used to unlock the doors of the compartments.&#160;<br/>
“Here is the explanation of how one man was&#160;able to pass through locked doors,” said M.&#160;<br/>
Bouc. “Your questions to Mrs. Hubbard were unnecessary. Locked or not locked, the man could&#160;<br/>easily get through the communicating door. After all, if a Wagon Lit uniform, why not a Wagon&#160;<br/>Lit key?”&#160;<br/>
“Why not indeed?”&#160;returned Poirot.&#160;<br/>“We might have known it, really. You remember&#160;that Michel said that the door into the&#160;<br/>
corridor of Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment was locked when he came in answer to her bell.”&#160;<br/>
“That is so, Monsieur,” said the conductor. “That is why I thought the lady must have been&#160;<br/>
dreaming.”&#160;<br/>
“But now it is easy,” continued M. Bouc. “Doubtless he meant to relock&#160;the communicating&#160;<br/>
door, also, but perhaps he heard some&#160;movement&#160;from&#160;the bed and it startled him.”&#160;<br/>
“We have now,” said Poirot, “only to find the scarlet kimono.”&#160;<br/>“True. And these last two compartments are occupied by men.”&#160;<br/>“We will search all the same.”&#160;<br/>“Oh! assuredly. Besides, I remember&#160;what you said.”&#160;<br/>Hector MacQueen acquiesced willingly in the search. “I’d just as soon you did,” he said with&#160;<br/>
a rueful smile. “I&#160;feel I’m&#160;definitely the&#160;most&#160;suspicious&#160;character on&#160;the train. You’ve only got&#160;<br/>to find a will in which the old man left me&#160;all his money, and that’ll just about fix things.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc bent a suspicious glance upon him.&#160;<br/>“That’s only my fun,” added MacQueen hastily. “He’d never have&#160;left me&#160;a cent, really. I was&#160;<br/>
just useful to him—languages and so on. You’re&#160;likely to be out of&#160;luck, you know, if you don’t&#160;<br/>

speak anything but good American. I’m&#160;no linguist&#160;myself, but I know what I call Shopping and&#160;<br/>Hotel—snappy bits in French and German and Italian.”&#160;<br/>
His voice was a little louder than usual. It was as though he&#160;were slightly&#160;uneasy over the&#160;<br/>
search in spite of his expressed willingness.&#160;<br/>
Poirot emerged. “Nothing,” he said.&#160;“Not even a compromising bequest!”&#160;<br/>MacQueen sighed. “Well, that’s a load&#160;off my mind,” he&#160;said humorously.&#160;<br/>They moved on to the last compartment. The examination of&#160;the&#160;luggage of the big Italian and&#160;<br/>
of the valet yielded no result.&#160;<br/>
The three men stood at the end of the coach looking at each other.&#160;<br/>“What next?” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“We will go back to the dining-car,” said Poirot. “We&#160;know now all that we can know. We&#160;<br/>
have the evidence of the passengers, the evidence&#160;of their baggage, the evidence of our eyes. ...&#160;<br/>We can expect no further help. It must&#160;be our part now to use our brains.”&#160;<br/>
He felt in his pocket for his&#160;cigarette case. It was empty.&#160;<br/>“I will join you in a moment,” he said. “I shall&#160;need the cigarettes. This&#160;is a very difficult, a&#160;<br/>
very curious, affair. Who wore that scarlet kimono?&#160;Where is it now?&#160;I wish I knew. There is&#160;<br/>something in this&#160;case—some&#160;factor—that escapes me! It is difficult because it has been&#160;<i>made</i>&#160;<br/>difficult. But we will discuss it. Pardon me a moment.”&#160;<br/>
He went hurriedly along the corridor to his own compartment. He had, he knew, a further&#160;<br/>
supply of cigarettes in one of his valises.&#160;<br/>
He got it down and snapped back the lock.&#160;<br/>Then he sat back on his heels and stared.&#160;<br/><i>Neatly folded on the top of the case was a thin scarlet silk kimono&#160;embroidered with dragons.&#160;<br/></i>“So,” he murmured. “It is like that. A&#160;defiance. Very well, I take it up.”&#160;<br/>

<i><b>HERCULE POIROT SITS&#160;BACK AND THINKS&#160;</b></i><br/>
<b>1&#160;</b><br/>
<b>WHICH OF THEM?&#160;</b><br/>
M. Bouc. and Dr. Constantine were talking together&#160;when Poirot entered the dining-car. M. Bouc&#160;<br/>was looking depressed.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Le voilà</i>,” said the latter&#160;when he saw Poirot. Then&#160;he added, as his friend sat down, “If you&#160;<br/>
solve this case,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>, I shall indeed believe in&#160;miracles!”&#160;<br/>
“It worries you, this case?”&#160;<br/>“Naturally it worries me. I cannot&#160;make head or tail of it.”&#160;<br/>“I agree,” said the doctor. He looked at Poirot&#160;with interest. “To be frank,” he said, “I cannot&#160;<br/>
see what you are going to do next.”&#160;<br/>
“No!” said Poirot thoughtfully.&#160;<br/>He took out his cigarette case and lit one of&#160;his tiny cigarettes. His eyes were dreamy.&#160;<br/>“That, to me, is the interest of&#160;this case,” he&#160;said. “We are cut off from all the normal routes&#160;<br/>
of procedure. Are these people whose evidence we&#160;have taken speaking&#160;the truth, or lying?&#160;We&#160;<br/>have no means of finding out—except such means as&#160;we can devise ourselves.&#160;It is&#160;an exercise,&#160;<br/>this, of the brain.”&#160;<br/>
“That is all very fine,” said M.&#160;Bouc. “But what have you to go upon?”&#160;<br/>“I told you just now. We&#160;have&#160;the evidence of the passengers and the evidence of our own&#160;<br/>
eyes.”&#160;<br/>
“Pretty evidence—that of&#160;the passengers!&#160;It told us just&#160;nothing at all.”&#160;<br/>Poirot shook his head.&#160;<br/>“I do not agree, my friend. The evidence of the passengers gave us several points of interest.”&#160;<br/>“Indeed,” said M. Bouc sceptically. “I did not observe it.”&#160;<br/>“That is because you did not listen.”&#160;<br/>“Well, tell me, what did I miss?”&#160;<br/>“I will just&#160;take one instance—the first evidence we heard, that of the young MacQueen. He&#160;<br/>
uttered, to my&#160;mind, one very significant phrase.”&#160;<br/>
“About the letters?”&#160;<br/>“No, not about the letters. As far as I can remember, his words were: ‘<i>We travelled about. Mr.&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Ratchett wanted to see the world. He&#160;was hampered by knowing no languages. I acted more as a&#160;<br/>courier than a secretary</i>.’&#160;”&#160;<br/>
He looked from&#160;the doctor’s face to that of M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“What? You still do not see?&#160;That is inexcusable—for you had a second chance again just&#160;<br/>
now when he said, ‘<i>You’re likely to be out of luck&#160;if you don’t speak anything but good&#160;<br/>American</i>.’ ”&#160;<br/>
“You mean—?”&#160;M. Bouc&#160;still looked puzzled.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=103></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Ah, it is that you want it given to you in words of one syllable. Well, here it is!&#160;<i>M. Ratchett&#160;</i><br/>
<i>spoke no French</i>. Yet, when the conductor came in answer&#160;to his bell last night, it was a voice&#160;<br/>speaking in&#160;<i>French</i>&#160;that&#160;told&#160;him&#160;that it was a&#160;mistake&#160;and that he was not wanted. It was,&#160;<br/>moreover, a perfectly idiomatic phrase that was used, not one that a man knowing only a few&#160;<br/>words of French would have selected. ‘<i>Ce n’est rien Je me suis trompé</i>.’ ”&#160;<br/>
“It is true,” cried Constantine excitedly. “We should have seen&#160;that! I remember your laying&#160;<br/>
stress on the words when you repeated them&#160;to us. Now I understand your reluctance to rely&#160;<br/>upon the evidence of the dented watch. Already, at twenty-three&#160;minutes to one, Ratchett was&#160;<br/>dead—”&#160;<br/>
“And it was his murderer speaking!”&#160;finished M. Bouc impressively.&#160;<br/>Poirot raised a deprecating hand.&#160;<br/>“Let us not go too fast. And do&#160;not let us assume more than we actually know. It is safe, I&#160;<br/>
think, to say that at that time—twenty-three minutes to one—<i>some other person&#160;</i>was in&#160;<br/>Ratchett’s compartment, and that that person&#160;either was French or could speak the French&#160;<br/>language fluently.”&#160;<br/>
“You are very cautious,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>—”&#160;<br/>“One should advance only a step at a time. We&#160;have no actual&#160;<i>evidence</i>&#160;that Ratchett was dead&#160;<br/>
at that time.”&#160;<br/>
“There is the cry that awakened you.”&#160;<br/>“Yes, that is true.”&#160;<br/>“In one way,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully, “this discovery does not&#160;affect things very much.&#160;<br/>
You heard someone moving about next door. That someone was not&#160;Ratchett, but&#160;the other man.&#160;<br/>Doubtless he is washing blood from&#160;his hands, clearing up after the crime, burning the&#160;<br/>incriminating letter. Then he waits&#160;till all is still, and, when he thinks it is safe and the coast is&#160;<br/>clear, he locks and chains Ratchett’s door on the inside, unlocks the communicating door through&#160;<br/>into Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment&#160;and slips out that way. In fact, it is exactly as we thought,&#160;<i>with&#160;<br/>the difference that Ratchett was&#160;killed about half an hour earlier&#160;</i>and the watch put on to a&#160;<br/>quarter past one to create an alibi.”&#160;<br/>
“Not such a famous alibi,” said Poirot. “The&#160;hands of the watch pointed to 1.15—the exact&#160;<br/>
time when the intruder actually left the scene of the crime.”&#160;<br/>
“True,” said M. Bouc, a little confused. “What then does the watch convey to you?”&#160;<br/>“If the hands were altered—I say&#160;<i>if</i>—then the time at which they were set&#160;<i>must</i>&#160;have a&#160;<br/>
significance.&#160;The natural reaction&#160;would be to suspect anyone who had a reliable alibi for the&#160;<br/>time indicated—in this case, 1.15.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, yes,” said the doctor.&#160;“That reasoning is good.”&#160;<br/>“We must also pay a little attention to the time the intruder&#160;<i>entered</i>&#160; the&#160;compartment. When&#160;<br/>
had he an opportunity of doing so?&#160;Unless we are to&#160;assume the complicity&#160;of the real conductor,&#160;<br/>there was only one time when he could have&#160;done so—during the time&#160;the train stopped at&#160;<br/>Vincovci. After the train left Vincovci the conductor was sitting facing the corridor, and whereas&#160;<br/>any one of the passengers would pay little&#160;attention to a Wagon Lit attendant, the&#160;<i>one</i>&#160;person&#160;<br/>who&#160;&#160;<i>would</i>&#160;notice an impostor is the real conductor. But during the halt at Vincovci the&#160;<br/>conductor is out on the platform. The&#160;coast is clear.”&#160;<br/>
“And by our former reasoning, it&#160;<i>must</i>&#160;be one of the passengers,” said M. Bouc. “We come&#160;<br/>
back to where we were. Which of them?”&#160;<br/>
Poirot smiled.&#160;<br/>“I have made a list,” he said. “If you like to&#160;see it, it will perhaps refresh your memory.”&#160;<br/>

The doctor and M. Bouc pored over the list together. It was written out&#160;neatly in a methodical&#160;<br/>
manner in the order in which the passengers had been interviewed.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
HECTOR MACQUEEN, American subject, Berth No. 6, Second Class.&#160;<br/>
<i>Motive</i>—Possibly arising out of association with dead man?&#160;<br/><i>Alibi</i>—From&#160;midnight to 2 A.M. (Midnight to&#160;1.30 vouched for by Col. Arbuthnot, and 1. 15&#160;<br/>
to 2 vouched for by conductor.)&#160;<br/>
<i>Evidence against him</i>—None.&#160;<br/><i>Suspicious circumstances</i>—None.&#160;<br/>
CONDUCTOR PIERRE&#160;MICHEL, French subject.&#160;<br/>
<i>Motive</i>—None.&#160;<br/><i>Alibi</i>—From&#160;midnight to 2 A.M. (Seen by H. P. in&#160;corridor at same&#160;time as voice spoke from&#160;<br/>
Ratchett’s compartment at 12.37. From&#160;1 A.M. to 1.16 vouched for by other two&#160;<br/>conductors.)&#160;<br/>
<i>Evidence against him</i>—None.&#160;<br/><i>Suspicious circumstances</i>—The Wagon Lit uniform found is&#160;a point in his favor since it&#160;<br/>
seems to have been intended&#160;to throw suspicion on him.&#160;<br/>
EDWARD MASTERMAN, English subject, Berth No. 4, Second Class.&#160;<br/>
<i>Motive</i>—Possibly arising out of connection with&#160;deceased, whose valet he&#160;was.&#160;<br/><i>Alibi</i>—From&#160;midnight to 2 A.M. (Vouched for by Antonio Foscarelli.)&#160;<br/><i>Evidence against him of&#160;suspicious circumstances</i>—None, except that he&#160;is the only&#160;man of&#160;<br/>
the right height or size to have worn the Wagon Lit uniform. On the other hand, it is&#160;<br/>unlikely that he speaks French well.&#160;<br/>
MRS. HUBBARD, American subject, Berth No. 3, First Class.&#160;<br/>
<i>Motive</i>—None.&#160;<br/><i>Alibi</i>—From&#160;midnight to 2 A.M.—None.&#160;<br/><i>Evidence against her or suspicious circumstances</i>—Story of man in&#160;her compartment is&#160;<br/>
substantiated by the evidence of Hardman and that of the woman Schmidt.&#160;<br/>
GRETA OHLSSON, Swedish subject, Berth No. 10, Second Class.&#160;<br/>
<i>Motive</i>—None.&#160;<br/><i>Alibi</i>—From&#160;midnight to 2 A.M. (Vouched for by Mary Debenham.)&#160;<br/>
Note: Was last to see Ratchett alive.&#160;<br/>
PRINCESS DRAGOMIROFF, Naturalised French subject, Berth No. 14, First Class.&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>NOTE:—The evidence of the passengers is supported by the statement of&#160;the conductor that&#160;<br/>
no one entered or left Mr. Ratchett’s compartment from&#160;midnight to 1 o’clock (when he himself&#160;<br/>went into the next coach)&#160;and from&#160;1.15 to 2 o’clock.&#160;<br/>
“That document, you understand,” said Poirot, “is a mere&#160;<i>précis</i>&#160;of the evidence we heard,&#160;<br/>

With a grimace, M. Bouc handed it back. “It is not illuminating,” he said.&#160;<br/>“Perhaps you may find this more&#160;to your taste,” said Poirot, with&#160;a slight smile as he handed&#160;<br/>
him&#160;a second sheet of paper.&#160;<br/>

<b>TEN QUESTIONS&#160;</b><br/>
On the paper was written:&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
THINGS NEEDING EXPLANATION&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
1.&#160;&#160;The handkerchief marked with&#160;the initial H. Whose is it?&#160;<br/>2.&#160;&#160;The pipe-cleaner. Was it dropped by Colonel Arbuthnot?&#160;Or by someone else?&#160;<br/>3.&#160;&#160;Who wore the scarlet kimono?&#160;<br/>4.&#160;&#160;Who was the man or woman masquerading in Wagon Lit uniform?&#160;<br/>5.&#160;&#160;Why do the hands of the watch point to 1.15?&#160;<br/>6.&#160;&#160;Was the murder committed at that time?&#160;<br/>7.&#160;&#160;Was it earlier?&#160;<br/>8.&#160;&#160;Was it later?&#160;<br/>9.&#160;&#160;Can we be sure that Ratchett was stabbed by more&#160;than one person?&#160;<br/>10.&#160;What other explanation of&#160;his wounds can there be?&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>“Well, let us see what we can do,” said M. Bouc, brightening a little at&#160;this challenge to his&#160;<br/>
wits. The handkerchief, to begin with. Let us by all means&#160;be orderly and methodical.”&#160;<br/>
“Assuredly,” said Poirot, nodding his head in a satisfied fashion.&#160;<br/>M. Bouc continued somewhat didactically.&#160;<br/>The initial H is connected with three people—Mrs. Hubbard, Miss Debenham, whose second&#160;<br/>
name&#160;is Hermione, and the maid Hildegarde Schmidt.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah! And of those three?”&#160;<br/>“It is&#160;difficult to say. But I&#160;<i>think</i>&#160;I should vote for Miss Debenham.&#160;For all one knows she may&#160;<br/>
be called by her second name and not her first. Also there is already some&#160;suspicion attaching to&#160;<br/>her. That conversation you overheard,&#160;<i>mon cher</i>, was certainly a little curious, and&#160;so is her&#160;<br/>refusal to explain it.”&#160;<br/>
“As for me, I plump for the American,” said&#160;Dr. Constantine. “It is a very expensive&#160;<br/>
handkerchief, that; and Americans, as all the world knows, do not care what they pay.”&#160;<br/>
“So you both eliminate the maid?”&#160;asked Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Yes. As she herself said, it is the handkerchief of a member&#160;of the upper classes.”&#160;<br/>And the second question—the pipe-cleaner.&#160;Did Colonel Arbuthnot drop it, or somebody&#160;<br/>
else?”&#160;<br/>
“That is more&#160;difficult. The English, they do not stab. You are right there. I incline to the view&#160;<br/>
that someone else dropped the pipe-cleaner—and did so to incriminate the long-legged&#160;<br/>Englishman.”&#160;<br/>
“As you said, M. Poirot,” put in the doctor, “<i>two</i>&#160;clues is too much carelessness. I agree with&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc. The handkerchief was a genuine oversight—hence none of the women will admit that&#160;<br/>it is hers. The pipe-cleaner is&#160;a faked clue. In support of that&#160;theory, you notice that Colonel&#160;<br/>Arbuthnot shows no embarrassment and admits freely to smoking a pipe and&#160;using that type of&#160;<br/>cleaner.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<a name=107></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“You reason well,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Question No. 3—Who wore the scarlet kimono!” went on M. Bouc. “As to that, I will&#160;<br/>
confess I have not the slightest idea. Have you any views on the subject, Dr. Constantine?”&#160;<br/>
“None.”&#160;<br/>“Then we confess ourselves beaten&#160;there. The&#160;next question has, at&#160;any rate, possibilities.&#160;<br/>
Who was the man or the woman masquerading in&#160;Wagon Lit uniform?&#160;Well, one can list with&#160;<br/>certainty a number of people that it could not have been. Hardman, Colonel Arbuthnot,&#160;<br/>Foscarelli, Count Andrenyi and&#160;Hector MacQueen are all too tall. Mrs. Hubbard, Hildegarde&#160;<br/>Schmidt and Greta Ohlsson are&#160;too broad. That leaves&#160;the valet, Miss Debenham, Princess&#160;<br/>Dragomiroff and Countess Andrenyi—and none of&#160;them&#160;sounds likely! Greta Ohlsson in one&#160;<br/>case, and Antonio Foscarelli in the other, both swear that Miss Debenham and the valet never left&#160;<br/>their compartments. Hildegarde&#160;Schmidt swears that the Princess was in hers, and Count&#160;<br/>Andrenyi has told us that his wife took a sleeping draught. Therefore it seems impossible that it&#160;<br/>can be anybody—which is absurd!”&#160;<br/>
“As our old friend Euclid says,” murmured Poirot.&#160;<br/>“It must be one of those four,” said Dr. Constantine. “Unless it is someone from&#160;outside who&#160;<br/>
has found a hiding-place—and that&#160;we agreed was impossible.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc had passed on to the next question on the list.&#160;<br/>“No. 5—Why do the hands of the broken watch point&#160;to 1.15?&#160;I can see&#160;two explanations of&#160;<br/>
that. Either it was done by the murderer to establish an alibi, and afterwards, when he meant to&#160;<br/>leave the compartment, he was prevented by&#160;hearing people moving about; or else—wait—I&#160;<br/>have an idea coming—”&#160;<br/>
The other two waited respectfully while&#160;M. Bouc struggled in mental agony.&#160;<br/>“I have it,” he said at last. “It was not the Wagon Lit murderer who tampered with the watch!&#160;<br/>
It was the person we have called the Second Murderer—the left-handed person—in other words&#160;<br/>the woman in the scarlet kimono.&#160;She arrives later and moves back&#160;the hands of the watch in&#160;<br/>order to make an alibi for herself.”&#160;<br/>
“Bravo said Dr. Constantine.&#160;“It is well imagined, that.”&#160;<br/>“In fact,” said Poirot, “she stabbed him&#160;in the&#160;dark, not realizing that&#160;he was dead already, but&#160;<br/>
somehow deduced that he had a watch in his&#160;pyjama pocket, took it out, put back the hands&#160;<br/>blindly, and gave it the requisite dent.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc looked at him&#160;coldly. “Have you anything better to suggest,&#160;yourself?” he asked. “At&#160;<br/>
the moment—no,” admitted Poirot. “All the same,” he&#160;went on, “I do&#160;not think you have either&#160;<br/>of you appreciated the most interesting point about that watch.”&#160;<br/>
“Does question No. 6 deal with it?” asked the doctor. “To that question—Was the murder&#160;<br/>
committed at that time, 1.15?—I&#160;answer&#160;<i>No</i>.”&#160;<br/>
“I agree,” said M. Bouc. “’Was it&#160;earlier?’ is the next question. I say—Yes! You, too,&#160;<br/>
doctor?”&#160;<br/>
The doctor nodded. “Yes, but the&#160;question ‘Was it later?’ can&#160;also be answered in the&#160;<br/>
affirmative. I agree with your theory, M. Bouc,&#160;and so, I think, does M.&#160;Poirot, although he does&#160;<br/>not wish to commit himself. The First Murderer came earlier than 1. 15, but the Second&#160;<br/>Murderer came&#160;<i>after</i>&#160;1.15. And as regards the question of left-handedness, ought we not to take&#160;<br/>steps to ascertain which of the passengers is left-handed?”&#160;<br/>
“I have not completely neglected that point,”&#160;said Poirot. “You may have noticed that I made&#160;<br/>
each passenger write either a signature or an address. That is not conclusive, because some&#160;<br/>people do certain actions with the right hand and&#160;others with the left.&#160;Some&#160;write right-handed,&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
107<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=108></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
but play golf left-handed. Still, it is something. Every person questioned took the pen in his or&#160;<br/>her right hand—with the exception of Princess Dragomiroff, who refused to write.”&#160;<br/>
“Princess Dragomiroff—impossible,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“I doubt if&#160;she would have had the strength to&#160;inflict that left-handed blow,” said Dr.&#160;<br/>
Constantine dubiously. ‘That particular wound had&#160;been inflicted with considerable force.”&#160;<br/>
“More force than a woman could use?”&#160;<br/>“No, I would not say that. But I think more force than an elderly woman could display, and&#160;<br/>
Princess Dragomiroff’s physique is particularly frail.”&#160;<br/>
“It might be a question of the influence&#160;of mind over body,” said Poirot. “Princess&#160;<br/>
Dragomiroff has great personality and immense&#160;will-power.&#160;But let us pass from&#160;that for the&#160;<br/>moment.”&#160;<br/>
“To questions Nos. 9 and 10?&#160;Can we be sure&#160;that&#160;Ratchett was&#160;stabbed by more than one&#160;<br/>
person, and what other explanation of the wounds can there be?&#160;In&#160;my&#160;opinion, medically&#160;<br/>speaking, there can be&#160;<i>no other&#160;</i>explanation of those wounds. To&#160;suggest that one man struck&#160;<br/>first feebly and then&#160;with violence, first with the right hand and&#160;then with the left, and after&#160;an&#160;<br/>interval of perhaps half an hour&#160;inflicted fresh wounds on a dead&#160;body—well, it does not make&#160;<br/>sense.”&#160;<br/>
“No,” said Poirot. “It does not make sense.&#160;And you think that two murderers do make&#160;<br/>
sense?”&#160;<br/>
“As you yourself have said, what other explanation can there be?”&#160;<br/>Poirot stared straight ahead of him. “That is what I ask myself,” he said. “That is what I never&#160;<br/>
cease to ask myself.”&#160;<br/>
He leaned back in his seat.&#160;<br/>“From&#160;now on, it is all here.” He tapped himself on the forehead. “We have thrashed it all out.&#160;<br/>
The facts are all in front of us—neatly arranged with order and&#160;method.&#160;The passengers have sat&#160;<br/>here, one by one, giving their evidence. We&#160;know all that can be known—<i>from outside&#160;</i>...&#160;<br/>
He gave M. Bouc an affectionate smile.&#160;<br/>“It has been&#160;a little joke&#160;between us,&#160;has it not—this business of sitting back and&#160;<i>thinking</i>&#160;out&#160;<br/>
the truth? Well, I am&#160;about to put my&#160;theory into practice—here before&#160;your eyes. You two must&#160;<br/>do the same. Let us all three close our eyes and&#160;<i>think</i>. ...&#160;<br/>
“One or more&#160;of those passengers killed Ratchett.&#160;<i>Which of&#160;them</i>?”&#160;<br/>

<b>3&#160;</b><br/>
<b>CERTAIN SUGGESTIVE POINTS&#160;</b><br/>
It was quite a quarter of an hour before anyone spoke.&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine had started by trying to&#160;obey Poirot’s instructions. They had&#160;<br/>
endeavoured&#160;to see through a maze of conflicting&#160;particulars to a clear and&#160;outstanding&#160;solution.&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc’s thoughts had run something as follows:&#160;<br/>“Assuredly I must think. But as far as that&#160;goes I have already thought. ... Poirot obviously&#160;<br/>
thinks that this English girl is&#160;mixed up in the matter. I cannot help feeling that&#160;that is most&#160;<br/>unlikely. ... The English&#160;are extremely cold.&#160;Probably&#160;it is because they have no figures. ...&#160;But&#160;<br/>that is not the point. It seems&#160;that the Italian could not have done it—a pity. I suppose the&#160;<br/>English valet is not lying when&#160;he said the other never left the compartment?&#160;But why should he!&#160;<br/>It is not easy to&#160;bribe&#160;the&#160;English; they are so unapproachable. The whole thing is most&#160;<br/>unfortunate. I wonder when we shall&#160;get out of this. There must be&#160;<i>some</i>&#160;rescue work in progress.&#160;<br/>They are so slow in these countries ... it is hours&#160;before anyone thinks&#160;of doing anything. And the&#160;<br/>police of these countries, they will be most&#160;trying to deal with—puffed up with importance,&#160;<br/>touchy, on their dignity.&#160;They will make a&#160;grand affair of all this. It is not often that such a&#160;<br/>chance comes their way. It will&#160;be in all the newspapers. ...”&#160;<br/>
And from there on, M. Bouc’s thoughts went&#160;along a well-worn course which they had&#160;<br/>
already traversed some&#160;hundred times.&#160;<br/>
Dr. Constantine’s thoughts ran thus:&#160;<br/>“He is queer, this little man. A genius? Or a crank?&#160;Will he solve this mystery?&#160;Impossible—I&#160;<br/>
can see no way out of it. It is all too confusing. ... Everyone is lying, perhaps. ... But even then,&#160;<br/>that does not help one. If they are all lying, it is&#160;just as confusing as if they were speaking the&#160;<br/>truth. Odd about those wounds. I cannot understand it.&#160;... It would be easier to understand if he&#160;<br/>had been shot—after all, the term&#160;‘gunman’ must mean that they shoot with a gun. A curious&#160;<br/>country, America. I should like to&#160;go there. It is so progressive. When I get home I must get hold&#160;<br/>of Demetrius Zagone—he has been to America,&#160;he has all the modern ideas. ... I wonder what&#160;<br/>Zia is doing at this moment.&#160;If my wife ever finds out—”&#160;<br/>
His thoughts went on to entirely private matters. ...&#160;<br/>Hercule Poirot sat very still.&#160;<br/>One might have thought he was asleep.&#160;<br/>And then, suddenly, after a quarter of an hour’s complete immobility his eyebrows began to&#160;<br/>
move slowly up his forehead. A little sigh escaped him. He murmured beneath his breath.&#160;<br/>
“But after all, why not?&#160;And if so—why, if so, that would explain everything.”&#160;<br/>His eyes opened. They were green&#160;like a cat’s. He said softly: “<i>Eh bien</i>. I have thought. And&#160;<br/>
you?”&#160;<br/>
Lost in their reflections,&#160;both men started violently.&#160;<br/>“I have thought also,” said M. Bouc, just&#160;a shade guiltily.&#160;“But I have arrived at no&#160;<br/>
conclusion. The elucidation of crime is your&#160;<i>métier</i>, not mine, my friend.”&#160;<br/>
“I, too, have&#160;reflected&#160;with great earnestness,” said&#160;the doctor,&#160;unblushingly&#160;recalling&#160;his&#160;<br/>
thoughts from&#160;certain pornographic&#160;details. “I have thought of&#160;many possible theories, but not&#160;<br/>one that really satisfies me.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
109<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
Poirot nodded amiably. His nod seemed to say:&#160;<br/>“Quite right.&#160;That is the proper thing&#160;to say. You have given me&#160;the cue I expected.”&#160;<br/>He sat very upright, threw out his chest, caressed his moustache and spoke in the manner of a&#160;<br/>
practised speaker addressing a public meeting.&#160;<br/>
“My friends, I have reviewed the facts in my&#160;mind, and have also gone over to myself the&#160;<br/>
evidence&#160;of&#160;the passengers—with&#160;this result: I see, nebulously as&#160;yet,&#160;a certain explanation&#160;that&#160;<br/>would cover the facts as we know them. It is a very curious explanation, and I cannot be sure as&#160;<br/>yet that it is the true one. To&#160;find out definitely I shall have&#160;to make certain experiments.&#160;<br/>
“I would like first to mention certain points which appear to me&#160;suggestive. Let us start with a&#160;<br/>
remark&#160;made&#160;to&#160;me&#160;by&#160;M.&#160;Bouc&#160;in this very place on the occasion of our first lunch together on&#160;<br/>the train. He commented on the fact that we were&#160;surrounded by people of all&#160;classes, of&#160;all ages,&#160;<br/>of&#160;all nationalities.&#160;That is a&#160;fact somewhat rare&#160;at this time of year. The Athens-Paris and&#160;the&#160;<br/>Bucharest-Paris coaches, for instance, are almost empty. Remember also, the passenger who&#160;<br/>failed to turn up. He is, I think,&#160;significant. Then there are some&#160;minor points that strike me&#160;as&#160;<br/>suggestive—for instance, the position of Mrs.&#160;Hubbard’s sponge-bag, the name&#160;of Mrs.&#160;<br/>Armstrong’s mother, the detective methods of M.&#160;Hardman, the suggestion of M. MacQueen that&#160;<br/>Ratchett himself destroyed the charred note we&#160;found, Princess Dragomiroff’s Christian name,&#160;<br/>and a grease spot on a Hungarian passport.”&#160;<br/>
The two men stared at him.&#160;<br/>“Do they suggest anything to you, those points?” asked Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Not a thing,” said M. Bouc frankly.&#160;<br/>“And&#160;<i>M. le docteur</i>?”&#160;<br/>“I do not understand in the least what you are talking of.”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc, meanwhile, seizing upon the one tangible thing his friend had mentioned, was&#160;<br/>
sorting through the passports. With a grunt he picked up that of Count and Countess Andrenyi&#160;<br/>and opened it.&#160;<br/>
“Is this what you mean?&#160;This dirty mark?”&#160;<br/>“Yes. It is a fairly fresh grease&#160;spot. You notice where it occurs?”&#160;<br/>“At the beginning of the description of the Count’s wife—her Christian name, to be exact. But&#160;<br/>
I confess that&#160;I still&#160;do not see the point.”&#160;<br/>
“I am&#160;going to approach it from&#160;another angle. Let us go back to the handkerchief found at the&#160;<br/>
scene of the crime. As we stated&#160;not long ago, three people are associated with&#160;the letter H: Mrs.&#160;<br/>Hubbard, Miss Debenham&#160;and the maid, Hildegarde Schmidt. Now let us regard that&#160;<br/>handkerchief from&#160;another point of view. It&#160;is, my friends, an extremely expensive&#160;<br/>handkerchief—an&#160;&#160;<i>objet de luxe</i>, hand-made, embroidered in Paris. Which of the passengers,&#160;<br/>apart from&#160;the initial, was likely to own such a handkerchief?&#160;Not Mrs. Hubbard, a worthy&#160;<br/>woman with no pretensions to reckless extravagance in dress. Not Miss Debenham—that class of&#160;<br/>Englishwoman has a dainty linen handkerchief,&#160;not an expensive wisp of cambric costing&#160;<br/>perhaps two hundred francs. And certainly not the maid. But there&#160;<i>are</i>&#160;two women on the tram&#160;<br/>who would be likely to own such a handkerchief. Let us see&#160;if we can connect them&#160;in any way&#160;<br/>with the letter H. The two women I refer to are Princess Dragomiroff—”&#160;<br/>
“Whose Christian name&#160;is Natalia,” put in M. Bouc ironically.&#160;<br/>“Exactly. And her Christian name, as I said&#160;just now, is decidedly&#160;suggestive. The other&#160;<br/>
woman is Countess Andrenyi. And&#160;at once something strikes us—”&#160;<br/>
“<i>You</i>!”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“<i>Me</i>, then. Her Christian name&#160;on her passport is&#160;disfigured by a blob&#160;of grease. just an&#160;<br/>
accident, anyone would say. But consider that Christian name. Elena. Suppose that, instead of&#160;<br/>Elena, it were&#160;<i>Helena</i>. That capital H could be turned into&#160;a capital E and then run over the small&#160;<br/><i>e&#160;</i>next to it quite easily—and then a spot of&#160;grease dropped to cover up the alteration.”&#160;<br/>
“Helena!” cried M. Bouc.&#160;“It is an idea, that.”&#160;<br/>“Certainly it is an idea! I look about for any&#160;confirmation, however slight, of my idea—and I&#160;<br/>
find it. One of the luggage labels on the Countess’s baggage is slightly damp. It is one that&#160;<br/>happens to run over the first initial on top of the case. That label has been soaked off and put on&#160;<br/>again in a different place.”&#160;<br/>
“You begin to convince me,” said M. Bouc. “But the Countess Andrenyi—surely—”&#160;<br/>“Ah, now,&#160;<i>mon vieux</i>, you must turn yourself round and approach an entirely different angle&#160;<br/>
of the case. How was this murder intended to appear to everybody?&#160;Do not forget that the snow&#160;<br/>has upset all the murderer’s original plan. Let us imagine, for a&#160;little minute, that there is no&#160;<br/>snow, that the train proceeded on its normal&#160;course. What, then, would have happened?&#160;<br/>
“The murder, let us say, would still have been&#160;discovered in all probability at&#160;the&#160;Italian&#160;<br/>
frontier early this morning. Much of the same&#160;evidence would have been given to the Italian&#160;<br/>police. The threatening letters would have been&#160;produced by M. MacQueen; M. Hardman would&#160;<br/>have told his story; Mrs. Hubbard would have&#160;been eager to&#160;tell how&#160;a man passed through her&#160;<br/>compartment; the button would have been found. I imagine that two things only would have been&#160;<br/>different. The man would have&#160;passed through Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment just before one&#160;<br/>o’clock—and the Wagon Lit uniform would have&#160;been found cast off in one of the toilets.”&#160;<br/>
“You mean?”&#160;<br/>“I mean that the murder was&#160;<i>planned to look like an outside job</i>. It would have been presumed&#160;<br/>
that the assassin had left the train at Brod where it is timed to arrive at 0.58. Somebody would&#160;<br/>probably have passed a strange Wagon Lit conductor in&#160;the corridor. The uniform&#160;would be left&#160;<br/>in a conspicuous place so as to&#160;show clearly just how the trick had been played. No suspicion&#160;<br/>would have attached to the passengers. That,&#160;my friends, was how the affair was intended to&#160;<br/>appear to the outside world.&#160;<br/>
“But the accident to the train&#160;changes everything. Doubtless we&#160;have here the reason why the&#160;<br/>
man remained in the compartment with his victim so long. He was waiting for the train to go on.&#160;<br/>But at last he realised that&#160;<i>the train was not going on</i>. Different plans would have to be made.&#160;<br/>The murderer would now be&#160;<i>known</i>&#160;to be still on the train.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, yes,” said M. Bouc impatiently. “I see&#160;all that. But where does&#160;the handkerchief come&#160;<br/>
in?”&#160;<br/>
“I am&#160;returning to it by a somewhat circuitous route. To begin&#160;with, you must realise that the&#160;<br/>
threatening letters were in the nature of a blind. They might have been lifted bodily out of an&#160;<br/>indifferently written American&#160;crime&#160;novel. They are not&#160;<i>real</i>. They are, in fact, simply intended&#160;<br/>for the police. What we have to ask ourselves is:&#160;‘Did they deceive Ratchett?’ On the face of it,&#160;<br/>the answer&#160;seems to be No. His instructions to&#160;Hardman seem&#160;to point to a definite ‘private’&#160;<br/>enemy, of whose identity he was well aware. That&#160;is, if we accept Hardman’s story as true. But&#160;<br/>Ratchett certainly received&#160;<i>one</i>&#160;letter of a very different&#160;character—the one containing a&#160;<br/>reference to the Armstrong baby, a fragment of&#160;which we found in his compartment. In case&#160;<br/>Ratchett had not realised it sooner, this was to&#160;make sure that he understood the reason of the&#160;<br/>threats against his life. That letter, as I have said all along, was&#160;<i>not</i>&#160;intended to be found. The&#160;<br/>murderer’s first care was&#160;to destroy it. This, then, was the second hitch in his plans. The first was&#160;<br/>the snow, the second was our reconstruction of that fragment.&#160;<br/>

“That the note was destroyed so&#160;carefully can mean only one thing.&#160;<i>There must be on the train&#160;</i><br/>
<i>someone so intimately connected&#160;with the Armstrong family that&#160;the finding of that note would&#160;<br/>immediately direct suspicion upon that person.</i>&#160;<br/>
“Now we come&#160;to the other two clues that&#160;we found. I pass over the pipe-cleaner. We have&#160;<br/>
already said a good deal about that. Let us pass on to the handkerchief. Taken at its simplest it is&#160;<br/>a clue which directly incriminates someone whose initial is H, and it was dropped there&#160;<br/>unwittingly by that person.”&#160;<br/>
“Exactly,” said Dr. Constantine. “She finds&#160;out that she has dropped the handkerchief and&#160;<br/>
immediately takes steps to conceal her Christian name.”&#160;<br/>
“How fast you go! You arrive at a conclusion much sooner than I would permit myself to do.”&#160;<br/>“Is there any&#160;other alternative?”&#160;<br/>‘Certainly there is.&#160;Suppose, for instance, that you have committed a crime and wish to cast&#160;<br/>
the blame for it on someone else.&#160;Well, there is on the&#160;train a certain person connected intimately&#160;<br/>with the Armstrong family—a woman. Suppose,&#160;then, that you leave there a handkerchief&#160;<br/>belonging to&#160;that woman. She will be questioned,&#160;her connection with the Armstrong family will&#160;<br/>be brought out—<i>et voilà</i>: motive—<i>and</i>&#160;an incriminating article of evidence.”&#160;<br/>
“But in such a case,” objected the doctor, “the person indicated, being innocent, would not&#160;<br/>
take steps to&#160;conceal her identity.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah, really? That is what you think?&#160;That is, truly, the opinion of the&#160;police court. But I know&#160;<br/>
human nature, my friend, and I tell you that, suddenly confronted with the possibility of being&#160;<br/>tried for murder, the most innocent person will lose his head and&#160;do the most absurd things. No,&#160;<br/>no, the grease spot and the changed label do not prove guilt—they only prove that the Countess&#160;<br/>Andrenyi is anxious for some&#160;reason to conceal her identity.”&#160;<br/>
“What do you think her connection with the Armstrong family can be? She has never been in&#160;<br/>
America, she says.”&#160;<br/>
“Exactly, and she speaks&#160;English with a foreign accent, and she has a very foreign appearance&#160;<br/>
which she exaggerates. But it should not be difficult to guess who she is. I mentioned just now&#160;<br/>the name&#160;of Mrs. Armstrong’s mother. It was ‘Linda Arden,’ and she was a very celebrated&#160;<br/>actress—among other things a Shakespearean actress. Think of&#160;<i>As&#160;You Like It</i>, with the Forest of&#160;<br/>Arden and Rosalind. It was there&#160;she got the inspiration for her&#160;acting name. ‘Linda Arden,’ the&#160;<br/>name&#160;by which she was known all over the world,&#160;was not her real name. It may have been&#160;<br/>Goldenberg; it is quite likely that she had Central European blood in her veins—a strain of&#160;<br/>Jewish, perhaps. Many nationalities drift to America. I suggest to you, gentlemen, that that&#160;<br/>young sister of Mrs. Armstrong’s, little more than&#160;a child at the time&#160;of the tragedy, was Helena&#160;<br/>Goldenberg, the younger daughter of Linda Arden,&#160;and that she married Count Andrenyi when&#160;<br/>he was an attaché in Washington.”&#160;<br/>
“But Princess Dragomiroff says that the girl married an Englishman.”&#160;<br/>“Whose name she cannot remember! I ask you, my&#160;friends, is that really likely? Princess&#160;<br/>
Dragomiroff loved Linda Arden as great ladies do&#160;love great artists. She was godmother to one&#160;<br/>of the actress’s daughters. Would she forget so&#160;quickly the married name&#160;of the other daughter?&#160;<br/>It is not likely. No, I think we can safely say that Princess Dragomiroff was lying. She knew&#160;<br/>Helena was on the train, she had seen her. She&#160;realised at once, as soon as she heard who&#160;<br/>Ratchett really was, that Helena would be suspected. And so, when we&#160;question her as to the&#160;<br/>sister, she promptly lies—is vague, cannot&#160;remember, but ‘thinks Helena married an&#160;<br/>Englishman’—a suggestion as far away from&#160;the truth as possible.”&#160;<br/>

One of the restaurant attendants came through&#160;the door at the end and&#160;approached them.&#160;He&#160;<br/>
addressed M. Bouc. &#160;<br/>
“The dinner,&#160;Monsieur, shall I serve&#160;it? It&#160;is ready&#160;some little time.”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc looked at Poirot.

his voice upraised:&#160;<br/>
“<i>Premier service. Le dîner est servi. Premier dîner</i>—First&#160;service.”&#160;<br/>

<b>THE GREASE&#160;SPOT ON&#160;A HUNGARIAN PASSPORT&#160;</b><br/>
Poirot shared a table with M. Bouc and the doctor.&#160;<br/>
The company assembled in the restaurant car was a very subdued one. They spoke little. Even&#160;<br/>
the loquacious Mrs. Hubbard was unnaturally quiet. She murmured as she sat:&#160;<br/>
“I don’t feel as though I had the heart to eat anything,” and then partook of everything offered&#160;<br/>
her, encouraged by the Swedish lady who seemed to regard her as a special charge.&#160;<br/>
Before the meal was served, Poirot had caught the chief attendant by the sleeve and&#160;<br/>
murmured something to him.&#160;Constantine made a&#160;pretty good guess as to&#160;what the instructions&#160;<br/>had been when he noticed that the Count and Countess Andrenyi were always served last and&#160;<br/>that at the end of the meat there was a delay in making out their bill. It therefore came about that&#160;<br/>the Count and Countess were the last&#160;left in the restaurant car.&#160;<br/>
When they rose at length and moved in the direction of the door, Poirot sprang up and&#160;<br/>
followed them.&#160;<br/>
“Pardon, Madame, you have dropped your handkerchief.”&#160;<br/>He was holding out to her the tiny monogrammed square.&#160;<br/>She took it, glanced at it, then handed it back to&#160;him. “You are mistaken, Monsieur, that is not&#160;<br/>
my handkerchief.”&#160;<br/>
“Not your handkerchief?&#160;Are you sure?”&#160;<br/>“Perfectly sure, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“And yet, Madame, it has your initial—the initial H.”&#160;<br/>The Count made a sudden movement. Poirot&#160;ignored him. His eyes were fixed on the&#160;<br/>
Countess’s face.&#160;<br/>
Looking steadily at him&#160;she replied:&#160;<br/>“I do not understand, Monsieur. My initials are E. A.”&#160;<br/>“I think not. Your name&#160;is Helena—not Elena. Helena Goldenberg, the younger daughter of&#160;<br/>
Linda Arden—Helena Goldenberg,&#160;the sister of Mrs. Armstrong.”&#160;<br/>
There was a dead silence for a minute or two. Both the Count and the Countess had gone&#160;<br/>
deadly white.&#160;<br/>
Poirot said in a gentler tone: “It is of&#160;no&#160;use denying. That is the truth, is it not?”&#160;<br/>The Count burst out furiously, “I demand, Monsieur, by what right you—”&#160;<br/>She interrupted him,&#160;putting up a small hand towards his mouth.&#160;<br/>“No, Rudolph. Let me&#160;speak. It is useless to deny&#160;what this gentleman says. We had better sit&#160;<br/>
down and talk the matter out.”&#160;<br/>
Her voice had changed. It still had the southern&#160;richness of tone, but it had become&#160;suddenly&#160;<br/>
more clear cut and incisive. It was, for the first time, a definitely American voice.&#160;<br/>
The Count was silenced. He obeyed the gesture of her hand and they both sat down opposite&#160;<br/>
Poirot.&#160;<br/>
“Your statement, Monsieur, is quite true,” said&#160;the Countess. “I am Helena Goldenberg, the&#160;<br/>
younger sister of Mrs. Armstrong.”&#160;<br/>
“You did not acquaint me with that fact&#160;this morning, Madame&#160;la Comtesse.”&#160;<br/>“No.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=115></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“In fact, all that your husband and you told me&#160;was a tissue of lies.”&#160;<br/>“Monsieur!” cried the Count angrily.&#160;<br/>“Do not be angry, Rudolph. M. Poirot puts the fact rather brutally, but what he says is&#160;<br/>
undeniable.”&#160;<br/>
“I am&#160;glad you admit the fact so freely, Madame. Will you now tell me&#160;your reasons for that,&#160;<br/>
and also for altering your Christian name&#160;on your&#160;passport?”&#160;<br/>
“That was my doing entirely,” put in the Count.&#160;<br/>Helena said quietly: “Surely, M. Poirot, you&#160;can guess my reason—our reason. This man who&#160;<br/>
was killed is&#160;the man who murdered my baby niece,&#160;who killed my&#160;sister,&#160;who broke my brother-<br/>in-law’s heart. Three of the people I loved best and who&#160;made&#160;up my home—my world!”&#160;<br/>
Her voice rang out passionately. She was a true daughter of that mother&#160;the emotional force of&#160;<br/>
whose acting had moved huge audiences to tears.&#160;<br/>
She went on more quietly.&#160;<br/>“Of all the people on the train I alone had&#160;probably the best motive for killing him.”&#160;<br/>“And you did not kill him, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“I swear to&#160;you, M. Poirot—and my husband knows—and will swear also—that much as I&#160;<br/>
may have been tempted to do so, I never lifted a hand against that man.”&#160;<br/>
“I, too, gentlemen.” said the Count. “I give you my word of honour that last night Helena&#160;<br/>
never left her compartment. She took a sleeping&#160;draught exactly as I said. She is utterly and&#160;<br/>entirely innocent.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked from&#160;one to the other of them.&#160;<br/>“On my word of honour,” repeated the Count.&#160;<br/>Poirot shook his head slightly.&#160;<br/>“And yet you took it upon yourself to alter the name&#160;in the passport?”&#160;<br/>“Monsieur&#160;Poirot,” the Count said earnestly and&#160;passionately, “consider my position. Do you&#160;<br/>
think I could stand the thought of my wife&#160;dragged through a sordid&#160;police case? She was&#160;<br/>innocent, I knew it, but what she said was true—because of&#160;her connection with the Armstrong&#160;<br/>family she would have been immediately suspected. She would have been questioned—attested,&#160;<br/>perhaps. Since some&#160;evil chance had taken us on the same&#160;train as this man Ratchett, there was, I&#160;<br/>felt sure, but one thing for it. I admit, Monsieur, that I lied to you—all, that is, save&#160;in one thing.&#160;<br/>My wife never left her compartment last night.”&#160;<br/>
He spoke with an earnestness&#160;that it was hard to gainsay.&#160;<br/>“I do not say that I disbelieve&#160;you, Monsieur,” said Poirot slowly. “Your family is, I know, a&#160;<br/>
proud and ancient one. It would be bitter indeed&#160;for you to have your wife dragged into an&#160;<br/>unpleasant police case. With that I can sympathise. But how then do you explain the presence of&#160;<br/>your wife’s handkerchief actually in&#160;the dead man’s compartment?”&#160;<br/>
“That handkerchief is not mine,&#160;Monsieur,” said the Countess.&#160;<br/>“In spite of the initial H?”&#160;<br/>“In spite of the initial.&#160;I have handkerchiefs not unlike that, but&#160;not one that is exactly of that&#160;<br/>
pattern. I know, of course, that&#160;I cannot hope to make you believe me, but I assure&#160;you that it is&#160;<br/>so. That handkerchief is not mine.”&#160;<br/>
“It may have been placed there by someone in order to incriminate you?”&#160;<br/>She smiled a little. “You are enticing me to admit&#160;that, after all, it is mine? But indeed, M.&#160;<br/>
Poirot, it isn’t.” She spoke with great earnestness.&#160;<br/>
“Then why, if the handkerchief was not yours,&#160;did you alter the name&#160;in the passport?”&#160;<br/>The Count answered this.&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=116></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Because we&#160;heard&#160;that a handkerchief had been&#160;found with the initial H on it. We&#160;talked the&#160;<br/>
matter over together&#160;before we came to be interviewed. I pointed out to Helena that if&#160;it were&#160;<br/>seen that her Christian name&#160;began with an H she would immediately be subjected to much more&#160;<br/>rigorous questioning. And the thing&#160;was so simple—to alter Helena&#160;to Elena, was easily done.”&#160;<br/>
“You have, M. le Comte, the makings of a very&#160;fine criminal,” remarked Poirot dryly. “A&#160;<br/>
great natural ingenuity, and an apparently remorseless determination to mislead justice.”&#160;<br/>
“Oh, no, no.” The girl leaned forward. “M. Poirot, he’s explained to you how it was.” She&#160;<br/>
broke from&#160;French into English. “I was scared—absolutely dead scared, you understand. It had&#160;<br/>been so awful—that time—and to&#160;have it all raked up again. And to be suspected and perhaps&#160;<br/>thrown into prison. I was just scared stiff,&#160;M. Poirot. Can’t you understand at all?”&#160;<br/>
Her voice was lovely—deep—rich—pleading, the voice of&#160;the&#160;daughter of Linda Arden the&#160;<br/>
actress.&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked gravely at her.&#160;<br/>“If I am to believe you, Madame—and I do not say that I will&#160;<i>not</i>&#160;believe you—then you must&#160;<br/>
help me.”&#160;<br/>
“Help you?”&#160;<br/>“Yes. The reason for the murder lies in the past—in that tragedy which broke up your home&#160;<br/>
and saddened your young life. Take me&#160;back into&#160;the past, Mademoiselle, that I may find there&#160;<br/>the link that explains the whole thing.”&#160;<br/>
“What can there be to tell you? They are all dead.” She repeated mournfully: “All dead—all&#160;<br/>
dead—Robert, Sonia—darling, darling Daisy.&#160;She was so sweet—so happy—she had such&#160;<br/>lovely curls. We&#160;were all just crazy about her.”&#160;<br/>
“There was another victim, Madame.&#160;An indirect victim, you might say.”&#160;<br/>“Poor Susanne?&#160;Yes, I had forgotten about her. The police questioned her. They were&#160;<br/>
convinced that she had something to do with it.&#160;Perhaps she had—but if&#160;so only innocently. She&#160;<br/>had, I&#160;believe, chatted&#160;idly with&#160;someone, giving information as&#160;to the time&#160;of&#160;Daisy’s outings.&#160;<br/>The poor thing got terribly wrought up—she thought she was being held responsible.” She&#160;<br/>shuddered. “She threw herself out of&#160;the window. Oh! it was horrible.”&#160;<br/>
She buried her face in her hands.&#160;<br/>“What nationality was she, Madame?”&#160;<br/>“She was French.”&#160;<br/>“What was her last&#160;name?”&#160;<br/>“It’s absurd, but I can’t remember—we all called her Susanne.&#160;A pretty, laughing girl. She&#160;<br/>
was devoted to Daisy.”&#160;<br/>
“She was the nursery-maid, was she not?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“Who was the nurse?”&#160;<br/>“She was a trained hospital nurse. Stengelberg her name&#160;was. She too was devoted to Daisy—<br/>
and to my&#160;sister.”&#160;<br/>
“Now, Madame, I want you to think carefully&#160;before you answer this question. Have you,&#160;<br/>
since you were on this train, seen&#160;anyone that you recognised?”&#160;<br/>
She stared at him. “I?&#160;No, no one at all.”&#160;<br/>“What about Princess Dragomiroff?”&#160;<br/>“Oh! her. I know her, of&#160;course. I thought you meant anyone—anyone from—from&#160;that time.”&#160;<br/>“So I did, Madame. Now think carefully. Some&#160;years have passed, remember. The person&#160;<br/>
might have altered his or her appearance.”&#160;<br/>

Helena pondered deeply. Then she said: “No—I am sure—there is no one.”&#160;<br/>“You yourself—you were a young girl at the time—did you have no one to superintend your&#160;<br/>
studies or to look after you?”&#160;<br/>
“Oh! yes, I had a dragon—a sort of&#160;governess to me&#160;and secretary to Sonia combined. She&#160;<br/>
was English—or rather Scotch; a big red-haired woman.”&#160;<br/>
“What was her name?”&#160;<br/>“Miss Freebody.”&#160;<br/>“Young or old?”&#160;<br/>“She seemed frightfully old to me. I suppose&#160;she couldn’t have been more than forty.&#160;<br/>
Susanne, of course, used to look&#160;after my&#160;clothes and maid me.”&#160;<br/>
“And there were no other inmates of the house?”&#160;<br/>“Only servants.”&#160;<br/>“And you are certain, quite certain, Madame, that&#160;you have recognised no&#160;one on the train?”&#160;<br/>She replied earnestly: “No one,&#160;Monsieur. No one at all.”&#160;<br/>

When the Count and Countess had departed, Poirot looked across at the other two.&#160;<br/>
“You see,” he said “we make progress.”&#160;<br/>“Excellent work,” said M. Bouc cordially.&#160;“On my&#160;part, I should never have dreamed of&#160;<br/>
suspecting Count and Countess Andrenyi. I will admit I thought them&#160;quite&#160;<i>hors de combat</i>. I&#160;<br/>suppose there is no doubt that she committed the crime?&#160;It is&#160;rather sad.&#160;Still, they will not&#160;<br/>guillotine her. There are extenuating circumstances. A few years’ imprisonment—that will be&#160;<br/>all.”&#160;<br/>
“In fact you are quite certain of her guilt.”&#160;<br/>“My dear friend—surely there is no doubt of it?&#160;I thought your reassuring manner was only to&#160;<br/>
smooth things over till we&#160;are dug out of the snow and&#160;the police take charge.”&#160;<br/>
“You do not believe&#160;the Count’s positive assertion—on his word of honor—that his&#160;wife is&#160;<br/>
innocent?”&#160;<br/>
“<i>Mon cher</i>—naturally—what else&#160;<i>could</i>&#160;he say? He adores his wife. He wants to save her! He&#160;<br/>
tells his lie very well—quite in the grand seigneur&#160;manner. But what else than a lie could it be?”&#160;<br/>
“Well, you know, I had the preposterous&#160;idea that it might be the truth.”&#160;<br/>“No, no. The handkerchief, remember. The&#160;handkerchief clinches the matter.”&#160;<br/>“Oh, I am&#160;not so sure about&#160;the handkerchief. You remember, I always told you that there&#160;<br/>
were two possibilities as to the&#160;ownership of the handkerchief.”&#160;<br/>
“All the same—”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc broke off. The door at the end had&#160;opened, and Princess Dragomiroff entered the&#160;<br/>
dining-car. She came straight to them and all three men rose to their feet.&#160;<br/>
She spoke to Poirot,&#160;ignoring the others.&#160;<br/>“I believe, Monsieur,”&#160;she said, “that you have a handkerchief of mine.”&#160;<br/>Poirot shot a glance of&#160;triumph at the other two.&#160;<br/>“Is this it, Madame?”&#160;<br/>He produced the little square of fine cambric.&#160;<br/>“That is it. It has my&#160;initial in the corner.”&#160;<br/>“But, Madame&#160;la Princesse, that&#160;is&#160;the letter H,” said M. Bouc. “Your Christian name—<br/>
pardon me—is Natalia.”&#160;<br/>
She gave him a cold stare.&#160;<br/>“That is correct, Monsieur. My&#160;handkerchiefs are always initialled in the Russian characters.&#160;<br/>
H is N in Russian.”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc was somewhat&#160;taken aback. There was something about this indomitable old lady&#160;<br/>
which made him&#160;feel flustered and uncomfortable.&#160;<br/>
“You did not tell us that this handkerchief was yours at&#160;the inquiry this morning.”&#160;<br/>“You did not ask me,” said the Princess drily.&#160;<br/>“Pray be seated, Madame,” said Poirot.&#160;<br/>She sighed. “I may as well, I suppose.” She sat down.&#160;<br/>“You need not make a long business of this, Messieurs.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

Your next question will be—How did my handkerchief come to be lying by a murdered man’s&#160;<br/>
body! My reply to that is&#160;that I have no idea.”&#160;<br/>
“You have really no idea?”&#160;<br/>“None whatever.”&#160;<br/>“You will excuse me, Madame, but how much&#160;can we rely upon the truthfulness&#160;of your&#160;<br/>
replies?”&#160;<br/>
Poirot said the words very softly.&#160;<br/>Princess Dragomiroff answered contemptuously.&#160;“I suppose you mean because I did not tell&#160;<br/>
you that Helena Andrenyi was Mrs. Armstrong’s sister?”&#160;<br/>
“In fact you deliberately lied to us in the matter.”&#160;<br/>“Certainly. I would do the same&#160;again. Her mother was my friend. I believe, Messieurs, in&#160;<br/>
loyalty—to one’s friends and one’s family and one’s caste.”&#160;<br/>
“You do not believe in doing your utmost&#160;to further the ends of justice?”&#160;<br/>“In this case I consider that justice—strict justice—has been done.”&#160;<br/>Poirot leaned forward.&#160;<br/>“You see my difficulty, Madame. In this matter&#160;of the handkerchief, even, am I to believe&#160;<br/>
you?&#160;Or are you shielding your friend’s daughter?”&#160;<br/>
“Oh! I see what you mean.” Her face broke&#160;into a grim smile. “Well, Messieurs, this&#160;<br/>
statement of mine can be easily proved. I will&#160;give you the address of&#160;the people in Paris who&#160;<br/>make my handkerchiefs. You have only to show&#160;them the one in question and they will inform&#160;<br/>you that it was made to my order over a year&#160;ago. The handkerchief is mine, Messieurs.”&#160;<br/>
She rose.&#160;<br/>“Have you anything further you wish to ask me?”&#160;<br/>“Your maid, Madame, did she recognise this handkerchief when&#160;we showed it to her this&#160;<br/>
morning?”&#160;<br/>
“She must have done so. She saw it and said nothing?&#160;Ah, well, that shows that she too can be&#160;<br/>
loyal.”&#160;<br/>
With a slight inclination of her head she passed out of the dining-car.&#160;<br/>“So that was it,” murmured Poirot softly. “I noticed just a trifling hesitation when I asked the&#160;<br/>
maid if she knew to whom&#160;the&#160;handkerchief belonged. She was uncertain whether or not to admit&#160;<br/>that it was her mistress’s. But how does that&#160;fit in&#160;with that&#160;strange central&#160;idea of mine?&#160;Yes, it&#160;<br/>might well be.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah!” said M. Bouc with a characteristic gesture. “She is a terrible old lady, that!”&#160;<br/>“Could she have murdered Ratchett?” asked Poirot of the doctor.&#160;<br/>He shook his head.&#160;<br/>“Those blows—the ones delivered with great&#160;force penetrating the muscle—never, never&#160;<br/>
could anyone with so frail&#160;a physique inflict them.”&#160;<br/>
“But the feebler ones?”&#160;<br/>“The feebler ones, yes.”&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;thinking,” said Poirot, “of&#160;the incident this morning when&#160;I said to her that the strength&#160;<br/>
was in her will rather than in her arm.&#160;It was in the nature of&#160;a trap, that remark. I wanted to see&#160;<br/>if she would look down at her right or her left arm. She did neither. She looked at them both. But&#160;<br/>she made a strange reply. She said, ‘No, I have no strength in these. I do&#160;not know whether to be&#160;<br/>sorry or glad.’ A curious remark that. It&#160;confirms me&#160;in my&#160;belief about the crime.”&#160;<br/>
“It did not settle the point&#160;about the left-handedness.”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“No. By the way, did you notice that Count Andrenyi keeps his&#160;handkerchief in his right-hand&#160;<br/>
breast pocket?”&#160;<br/>
M. Bouc shook his head. His mind reverted to the&#160;astonishing revelations&#160;of the last half-hour.&#160;<br/>
He murmured:&#160;<br/>
“Lies—and again lies. It amazes me, the number&#160;of lies we had told to us this morning.”&#160;<br/>“There are more still to discover,” said Poirot cheerfully.&#160;<br/>“You think so?”&#160;<br/>“I shall be very much disappointed if it is not so.”&#160;<br/>“Such duplicity is terrible,” said M. Bouc. “But it seems to please you,” he added&#160;<br/>
reproachfully.&#160;<br/>
“It has this advantage,” said Poirot. “If you confront anyone who has lied with the truth, he&#160;<br/>
will usually admit it—often out of sheer&#160;surprise. It is only necessary to&#160;guess&#160;<i>right</i>&#160;to produce&#160;<br/>your effect.&#160;<br/>
“That is the only way to conduct this case. I select each passenger in turn, consider his or her&#160;<br/>
evidence, and say to myself, ‘<i>If</i>&#160;so and so is lying, on what&#160;<i>point</i>&#160;is he lying, and what is the&#160;<br/><i>reason</i>&#160;for the lie?’ And I answer, ‘If he is lying—if, you mark—it could only be for such a&#160;<br/>reason and on such a point.’ We&#160;have done that&#160;once very successfully&#160;with Countess Andrenyi.&#160;<br/>We shall now proceed to try the same&#160;method on several other persons.”&#160;<br/>
“And supposing, my friend, that your guess happens to be wrong?”&#160;<br/>“Then one person, at any rate, will be&#160;completely freed from&#160;suspicion.”&#160;<br/>“Ah!—a process of elimination.”&#160;<br/>“Exactly.”&#160;<br/>“And whom do we tackle next?”&#160;<br/>“We are going to tackle that&#160;<i>pukka sahib</i>, Colonel Arbuthnot.”&#160;<br/>

<b>A SECOND INTERVIEW WITH&#160;COLONEL ARBUTHNOT&#160;</b><br/>
Colonel Arbuthnot was clearly annoyed at being summoned to the dining-car for a second&#160;<br/>interview. His face wore a most forbidding expression as he sat down and said:&#160;<br/>
“Well?”&#160;<br/>“All my&#160;apologies for troubling you a second time,” said Poirot. “But there is still some&#160;<br/>
information that I think you might be able to give us.”&#160;<br/>
“Indeed?&#160;I hardly think so.”&#160;<br/>“To begin with, you see this pipe-cleaner?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“Is it one of yours?”&#160;<br/>“Don’t know. I don’t put a private mark on them, you know.”&#160;<br/>“Are you aware, Colonel Arbuthnot, that you are the only man amongst the passengers in the&#160;<br/>
Stamboul-Calais carriage who smokes a pipe?”&#160;<br/>
“In that case it probably is one of mine.”&#160;<br/>“Do you know where it was found?”&#160;<br/>“Not the least idea.”&#160;<br/>“It was found by the body of the murdered man.”&#160;<br/>Colonel Arbuthnot raised his eyebrows.&#160;<br/>“Can you tell us, Colonel Arbuthnot, how&#160;it is likely to have got there?”&#160;<br/>“If you mean, did I drop it there myself, no, I didn’t.”&#160;<br/>“Did you go into Mr. Ratchett’s compartment at any time?”&#160;<br/>“I never even spoke to the man.”&#160;<br/>“You never spoke to him and you did not murder him?”&#160;<br/>The colonel’s eyebrows went up again sardonically.&#160;<br/>“If I had, I should hardly be likely to acquaint you with the fact. As&#160;a matter of fact I&#160;<i>didn’t</i>&#160;<br/>
murder the fellow.”&#160;<br/>
“Ah, well,” murmured Poirot. “It is of no consequence.”&#160;<br/>“I beg your pardon?”&#160;<br/>“I said that it was of no consequence.”&#160;<br/>“Oh!” Arbuthnot looked taken aback.&#160;He eyed Poirot uneasily.&#160;<br/>“Because, you see,” continued the little man, “the&#160;pipe-cleaner, it is of no importance. I can&#160;<br/>
myself think&#160;of eleven other excellent explanations of its presence.”&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot stared at him.&#160;<br/>“What I really wished to see you about was&#160;quite another matter,” went on Poirot. “Miss&#160;<br/>
Debenham&#160;may have told you, perhaps, that I overheard some&#160;words spoken&#160;to you at the station&#160;<br/>of Konya?”&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot did not reply.&#160;<br/>“She said, ‘<i>Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind us</i>!’ Do you know to what those&#160;<br/>
words referred?”&#160;<br/>
“I am&#160;sorry, M. Poirot, but I must refuse to answer that question.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Pourquoi</i>?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=122></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
The Colonel said stiffly, “I suggest that you&#160;ask Miss Debenham herself for the meaning of&#160;<br/>
those words.”&#160;<br/>
“I have done so.”&#160;<br/>“And she refused to tell you?”&#160;<br/>“Yes.”&#160;<br/>“Then I should think it would have been perfectly plain—even to you—that my lips are&#160;<br/>
sealed.”&#160;<br/>
“You will not give away&#160;a lady’s secret?”&#160;<br/>“You can put it that way, if you like.”&#160;<br/>“Miss Debenham&#160;told me that they referred to a private matter of her own.”&#160;<br/>“Then why not accept her word for it?”&#160;<br/>“Because, Colonel Arbuthnot, Miss Debenham&#160;is&#160;what one might call a highly suspicious&#160;<br/>
character.”&#160;<br/>
“Nonsense,” said the Colonel with warmth.&#160;<br/>“It is not nonsense.”&#160;<br/>“You have nothing whatever against her.”&#160;<br/>“Not the fact that Miss Debenham was companion governess; in the Armstrong household at&#160;<br/>
the time of&#160;the kidnapping of&#160;little Daisy Armstrong?”&#160;<br/>
There was a minute’s dead silence.&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded his head gently.&#160;<br/>“You see,” he said. “We know more than you think. If Miss Debenham is innocent, why did&#160;<br/>
she conceal that fact? Why&#160;did she tell me&#160;that she had never been in America?”&#160;<br/>
The Colonel cleared his throat. “Aren’t you possibly making a mistake?”&#160;<br/>“I am&#160;making no mistake. Why did Miss Debenham lie to me?”&#160;<br/>Colonel Arbuthnot shrugged his shoulders. “You&#160;had better ask her. I still think that you are&#160;<br/>
wrong.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot raised his voice and called. One of the restaurant attendants came from&#160;the far end of&#160;<br/>
the car.&#160;<br/>
“Go and ask the English lady in No. 11 if&#160;she will be good enough to come here.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Bien, Monsieur</i>.”&#160;<br/>The man departed. The four men sat in silence. Colonel Arbuthnot’s&#160;face looked as though it&#160;<br/>
were carved out of wood,&#160;rigid and impassive.&#160;<br/>
The man returned.&#160;<br/>“The lady is just coming, Monsieur.”&#160;<br/>“Thank you.”&#160;<br/>A minute or two later Mary Debenham entered the dining-car.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<b>THE IDENTITY OF&#160;MARY DEBENHAM&#160;</b><br/>
She wore no hat. Her head was thrown back as&#160;though in defiance. “The sweep of her hair back&#160;<br/>from&#160;her face, the curve of her nostril suggested&#160;the figure-head of a ship plunging gallantly into&#160;<br/>a rough sea. In that moment she was beautiful.&#160;<br/>
Her eyes went to Arbuthnot for a minute—just&#160;a minute. She said to Poirot, “You wished to&#160;<br/>
see me?”&#160;<br/>
“I wished to ask you, Mademoiselle, why you lied to us this morning?”&#160;<br/>“Lied to you?&#160;I don’t know what you mean.”&#160;<br/>“You concealed the fact that at the time of&#160;the Armstrong tragedy you were actually living in&#160;<br/>
the house. You told me&#160;that you had never been in America.”&#160;<br/>
He saw her flinch for a moment and then recover herself.&#160;<br/>“Yes,” she said. “That is true.”&#160;<br/>“No, Mademoiselle, it was false.”&#160;<br/>“You misunderstood me. I mean that it is true that I lied to you.”&#160;<br/>“Ah, you admit it?”&#160;<br/>Her lips curved into a smile. “Certainly, since you have found me&#160;out.”&#160;<br/>“You are at least frank, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>“There does not seem&#160;anything else for me&#160;to be.”&#160;<br/>“Well, of course, that is true. And now, Mademoiselle, may I ask you the reason for these&#160;<br/>
evasions?”&#160;<br/>
“I should have thought the reason leapt to the eye, M. Poirot.”&#160;<br/>“It does not leap to mine, Mademoiselle.”&#160;<br/>She said in a quiet even voice with a trace of&#160;hardness in it, “I have my living to get.”&#160;<br/>“You mean—?”&#160;<br/>She raised her eyes and looked him&#160;full in the face. “How much do you know, M. Poirot, of&#160;<br/>
the fight to&#160;get and&#160;keep decent employment?&#160;Do&#160;you think that a girl who had been detained&#160;in&#160;<br/>connection with a murder case, whose name&#160;and perhaps photograph were reproduced in the&#160;<br/>English papers—do you think that any nice ordinary&#160;middle-class woman would want to engage&#160;<br/>that girl as governess to her daughters?”&#160;<br/>
“I do not see why not—if no&#160;blame attached to you.”&#160;<br/>“Oh, blame—it is not&#160;<i>blame</i>—it is the publicity! So far, M. Poirot, I have succeeded in life. I&#160;<br/>
have had well-paid, pleasant posts. I was not going to risk the position&#160;I had attained when no&#160;<br/>good end could have been served.”&#160;<br/>
“I will venture to suggest, Mademoiselle, that I would have been&#160;the best judge of that, not&#160;<br/>
you.”&#160;<br/>
She shrugged her shoulders.&#160;<br/>“For instance, you could have helped&#160;me&#160;in the matter of identification.”&#160;<br/>“What do you mean?”&#160;<br/>“Is it possible, Mademoiselle,&#160;that you did not recognise in&#160;the Countess Andrenyi, Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Armstrong’s young sister whom&#160;you taught in New York?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
123<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=124></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“Countess Andrenyi?&#160;No.” She shook her head. “It may seem extraordinary to you—but I did&#160;<br/>
not recognise her. She was not&#160;grown up, you see, when I knew her. That was over three years&#160;<br/>ago. It is true that the Countess reminded me&#160;of someone; it&#160;puzzled me. But she looks so&#160;<br/>foreign—I never connected her with&#160;the little American&#160;schoolgirl. I only glanced at her casually&#160;<br/>when coming into the restaurant&#160;car,&#160;and I noticed her clothes more than her face.” She smiled&#160;<br/>faintly. “Women do! And then—well—I had my&#160;own preoccupations.”&#160;<br/>
“You will not tell me your secret, Mademoiselle?”&#160;<br/>Poirot’s voice was very&#160;gentle and persuasive.&#160;<br/>She said in a low voice, “I can’t—I can’t.”&#160;<br/>And suddenly, without warning, she broke down, dropping her face down upon her&#160;<br/>
outstretched arms&#160;and crying as&#160;though her heart would break.&#160;<br/>
The Colonel sprang up and stood awkwardly beside her.&#160;<br/>“I—look here—”&#160;<br/>He stopped and turning round scowled fiercely at Poirot.&#160;<br/>“I’ll break every bone in your damned body, you&#160;dirty little whipper-snapper,” he said.&#160;<br/>“Monsieur,” protested M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>Arbuthnot had turned back to the girl. “Mary—for God’s sake—”&#160;<br/>She sprang up. “It’s nothing. I’m&#160;all right. You don’t need me&#160;any more, do you, M. Poirot?&#160;If&#160;<br/>
you do, you must come&#160;and find me. Oh, what an idiot—what an idiot I’m&#160;making of myself!”&#160;<br/>She hurried out of the car.&#160;<br/>
Arbuthnot, before following her, turned once more on Poirot.&#160;<br/>“Miss Debenham’s got nothing to do with this&#160;business—nothing, do you hear?&#160;And if she’s&#160;<br/>
worried and interfered with, you’ll have&#160;me&#160;to deal with.” He strode out.&#160;<br/>
“I like to see an angry Englishman,” said&#160;Poirot. “They are very amusing. The more&#160;<br/>
emotional they feel, the less command they have of language.”&#160;<br/>
But M. Bouc was not interested in the emotional reactions of Englishmen. He was overcome&#160;<br/>
by admiration of his friend.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Mon cher, vous êtes épatant</i>!” he cried. “Another miraculous guess.”&#160;<br/>“It is incredible how you think of these&#160;things,” said Dr. Constantine admiringly.&#160;<br/>“Oh, I claim no credit this time. It was not a&#160;guess. Countess Andrenyi&#160;practically told me.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Comment</i>?&#160;Surely not?”&#160;<br/>“You remember, I asked her about her governess or companion?&#160;I had already decided in my&#160;<br/>
mind that&#160;<i>if</i>&#160;Mary Debenham&#160;were mixed up in the matter, she must have figured in the&#160;<br/>household in some&#160;such capacity.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes, but the Countess Andrenyi described a totally different person.”&#160;<br/>“Exactly. A&#160;tall middle-aged woman with red hair—in fact, the exact opposite in every&#160;<br/>
respect of Miss Debenham, so much so as to be&#160;quite&#160;remarkable. But then she had to invent&#160;a&#160;<br/>name&#160;quickly, and there it was that the unconscious&#160;association of ideas gave her away. She said,&#160;<br/>Miss Freebody, you remember.”&#160;<br/>
“Yes?”&#160;<br/>“<i>Eh bien</i>,&#160;you may not know it, but there is a shop&#160;in London that was called until recently&#160;<br/>
Debenham&#160;&amp; Freebody. With the name&#160;Debenham&#160;running in her head, the Countess clutches at&#160;<br/>another name quickly, and the first that comes is Freebody. Naturally I&#160;understood immediately.”&#160;<br/>
“That is yet another lie. Why did she do it?’&#160;<br/>“Possibly more loyalty. It makes things a little difficult.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Ma foi</i>!” said M. Bouc with violence. “But&#160;does everybody on this train tell lies?”&#160;<br/>

<b>FURTHER SURPRISING REVELATIONS&#160;</b><br/>
“Nothing would surprise me&#160;now,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>
“Nothing! Even if everybody in the train proved to have been in the Armstrong household, I&#160;<br/>
should not express surprise.”&#160;<br/>
“That is a very profound remark,” said Poirot. “Would you like to&#160;see what your favorite&#160;<br/>
suspect, the Italian, has to say for himself?”&#160;<br/>
“You are going to make another of&#160;these famous guesses of yours?”&#160;<br/>“Precisely.”&#160;<br/>“It is really a&#160;<i>most</i>&#160;extraordinary case,” said Constantine.&#160;<br/>“No, it is most natural.”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc flung up his arms&#160;in comic&#160;despair. “If this is what you call natural,&#160;<i>mon ami</i>—”&#160;<br/>
Words failed him.&#160;<br/>
Poirot had by this time&#160;requested the dining-car attendant to fetch Antonio Foscarelli.&#160;<br/>The big Italian had a wary look in his eye as he&#160;came in. He shot nervous&#160;glances from&#160;side to&#160;<br/>
side like a trapped animal.&#160;<br/>
“What do you want!” he said. “I have&#160;nothing more to tell you—nothing, do you hear?&#160;<i>Per&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Dio</i>—” He struck his hand on the table.&#160;<br/>
“Yes, you have something more to tell us,” said Poirot firmly. “The truth!”&#160;<br/>“The truth?” He shot an uneasy&#160;glance at&#160;Poirot.&#160;All the assurance and geniality had gone out&#160;<br/>
of his manner.&#160;<br/>
“<i>Mais oui</i>. It may be that I know it already. But it&#160;will be a point in your favour if it comes&#160;<br/>
from&#160;you spontaneously.”&#160;<br/>
“You talk like the American police. ‘Come clean’—that is what they say—‘come clean.’ ”&#160;<br/>“Ah! so you have had experience of the New York police?”&#160;<br/>“No, no, never. They could not prove a thing against me—but it was not for want of trying.”&#160;<br/>Poirot said quietly: “That was in the Armstrong case, was it not?&#160;You were the chauffeur?”&#160;<br/>His eyes met those of the Italian. The bluster&#160;went out of the big man. He was like a pricked&#160;<br/>
balloon.&#160;<br/>
“Since you know—why ask me?”&#160;<br/>“Why did you lie this morning?”&#160;<br/>“Business reasons. Besides, I do not trust the Jugo-Slav police. They hate the Italians. They&#160;<br/>
would not have given me&#160;justice.”&#160;<br/>
“Perhaps it is exactly justice that they&#160;<i>would</i>&#160;have given you!”&#160;<br/>“No, no, I had nothing to do with this business last&#160;night. I never left my carriage. The long-<br/>
faced Englishman, he can tell you&#160;so. It was not&#160;I who killed&#160;this pig—this Ratchett. You cannot&#160;<br/>prove anything against me.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot was writing something on a sheet of paper. He looked up and said quietly: “Very good.&#160;<br/>
You can go.”&#160;<br/>
Foscarelli lingered uneasily. “You realise that it was not I?&#160;That I could have had nothing to&#160;<br/>
do with it!”&#160;<br/>
“I said that you could go.”&#160;<br/>

“It is a conspiracy. You are going to frame me?&#160;All for a pig&#160;of a man who should have gone&#160;<br/>
to the chair! It was an infamy that he did not. If it had been me—if I had been arrested—”&#160;<br/>
“But it was not you. You had nothing to&#160;do with the kidnapping of the child.”&#160;<br/>“What is that you are saying?&#160;Why, that little one—she was the delight of the house. Tonio,&#160;<br/>
she called me. And she would sit in the car and pretend to&#160;hold the wheel. All the household&#160;<br/>worshipped her! Even the police came to understand that. Ah,&#160;the beautiful&#160;little one!”&#160;<br/>
His voice had softened. The tears came into his eyes. Then he wheeled round abruptly on his&#160;<br/>
heel and strode out of the dining-car.&#160;<br/>
“Pietro,” called Poirot.&#160;<br/>The dining-car attendant came at a run.&#160;<br/>“The No. 10—the Swedish lady.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Bien, Monsieur</i>.”&#160;<br/>“Another?” cried M. Bouc. “Ah, no—it is not&#160;possible. I tell you it is not possible.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Mon cher</i>—we have to&#160;<i>know</i>. Even if in the end everybody on&#160;the train proves to have had a&#160;<br/>
motive for killing Ratchett, we have to know. Once we know, we&#160;can settle once for all where&#160;<br/>the guilt lies.”&#160;<br/>
“My head is spinning,” groaned M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>Greta Ohlsson was ushered in sympathetically&#160;by the attendant. She was weeping bitterly.&#160;<br/>She collapsed on the seat facing Poirot and&#160;wept steadily into&#160;a&#160;large handkerchief.&#160;<br/>“Now do not distress yourself, Mademoiselle. Do&#160;not distress yourself,” Poirot patted her on&#160;<br/>
the shoulder. “Just a few little words of truth, that&#160;is all. You were the&#160;nurse who was in charge&#160;<br/>of little Daisy Armstrong?”&#160;<br/>
“It is true—it is true,” wept the wretched woman. “Ah, she was an angel—a little sweet&#160;<br/>
trustful angel. She knew nothing&#160;but kindness and love—and she was taken away by that wicked&#160;<br/>man—cruelly treated—and her poor mother—and the other little one who never lived&#160;at all.&#160;You&#160;<br/>cannot understand—you cannot know—if you had been&#160;there as I was—if you had seen the&#160;<br/>whole terrible tragedy! I ought to have told you&#160;the truth about myself this morning. But I was&#160;<br/>afraid—afraid. I did so rejoice that that evil man was dead—that&#160;he could not any more kill or&#160;<br/>torture little children. Ah! I cannot speak—I have no words. ...”&#160;<br/>
She wept with more vehemence than ever.&#160;<br/>Poirot continued to pat her gently on the shoulder. “There—there—I comprehend—I&#160;<br/>
comprehend everything—everything, I tell you. I will ask you no&#160;more questions. It is enough&#160;<br/>that you have&#160;admitted what I know to be the truth. I understand, I tell you.”&#160;<br/>
By now inarticulate with sobs, Greta Ohlsson&#160;rose and groped her way towards the door. As&#160;<br/>
she reached it she collided with a man coming in.&#160;<br/>
It was the valet—Masterman.&#160;<br/>He came straight up to Poirot and spoke&#160;in his usual quiet, unemotional voice’.&#160;<br/>“I hope I’m not intruding, sir. I thought it best to come&#160;along at once, sir,&#160;and tell you the&#160;<br/>
truth. I was Colonel Armstrong’s batman in the War,&#160;sir, and afterwards&#160;I was his valet in New&#160;<br/>York. I’m afraid I concealed that fact this morning. It was very wrong of me, sir, and I thought&#160;<br/>I’d better come&#160;and make a clean&#160;breast of it. But I hope, sir, that you’re not suspecting Tonio in&#160;<br/>any way. Old Tonio, sir, wouldn’t hurt a fly. And&#160;I can swear positively that he never left the&#160;<br/>carriage all last night. So, you see,&#160;sir, he couldn’t have done it.&#160;Tonio may be a foreigner, sir,&#160;<br/>but he’s a very gentle creature. Not like those nasty murdering Italians one reads about.”&#160;<br/>
He stopped.&#160;<br/>Poirot looked steadily at him. “Is that all you have to say?”&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

“That is all, sir.”&#160;<br/>He paused; then, as Poirot did not speak, he&#160;made an apologetic little bow and after a&#160;<br/>
momentary hesitation left the dining-car in the same&#160;quiet unobtrusive fashion as he had come.&#160;<br/>
“This,” said Dr. Constantine, “is&#160;more wildly improbable&#160;than&#160;any&#160;<i>roman policier&#160;</i>I have ever&#160;<br/>
read.”&#160;<br/>
“I agree,” said M. Bouc. “Of the twelve passengers in that coach, nine have been proved to&#160;<br/>
have had a connection with the Armstrong case. What next, I ask you? Or should I say, who&#160;<br/>next?”&#160;<br/>
“I can almost give you the answer to your question,” said Poirot. “Here comes our American&#160;<br/>
sleuth, Mr. Hardman.”&#160;<br/>
“Is he, too, coming to confess?”&#160;<br/>Before Poirot could reply the American had reached their table. He cocked an alert eye at&#160;<br/>
them&#160;and sitting down he drawled out: “Just exactly what’s up on this train?&#160;It seems bughouse&#160;<br/>to me.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot twinkled at him.&#160;<br/>“Are you quite sure, Mr. Hardman, that you yourself were not the gardener at the Armstrong&#160;<br/>
home?”&#160;<br/>
“They didn’t have a garden,” replied Mr. Hardman literally.&#160;<br/>“Or the butler?”&#160;<br/>“Haven’t got the fancy manners for a place like&#160;that. No, I never had any connection with the&#160;<br/>
Armstrong house—but I’m&#160;beginning to believe I’m&#160;about the only one on this train who hadn’t!&#160;<br/>Can you beat it? That’s what I say—can you beat it?”&#160;<br/>
“It is certainly a little surprising,” said Poirot mildly.&#160;<br/>“<i>C’est rigolo</i>,” burst from M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>“Have you any ideas of your own about the&#160;crime, Mr. Hardman?” inquired Poirot.&#160;<br/>“No, sir. It’s got me beat. I don’t know&#160;how to figure it out. They can’t&#160;<i>all</i>&#160;be in it—but which&#160;<br/>
one is the guilty party is beyond me. How did you get wise to all this?&#160;That’s what I want to&#160;<br/>know.”&#160;<br/>
“I just guessed.”&#160;<br/>“Then, believe me, you’re a pretty slick guesser. Yes, I’ll tell the world you’re a slick&#160;<br/>
guesser.”&#160;<br/>
Mr. Hardman leaned back and&#160;looked at Poirot admiringly.&#160;<br/>“You’ll excuse me,” he said, “but no one would&#160;believe it to look at you. I take off my hat to&#160;<br/>
you. I do indeed.”&#160;<br/>
“You are too kind, M. Hardman.”&#160;<br/>“Not at all. I’ve&#160;got to hand it to you.”&#160;<br/>“All the same,” said Poirot, “the problem&#160;is not&#160;yet quite solved. Can we say with authority&#160;<br/>
that we know who killed M. Ratchett?”&#160;<br/>
“Count me out,” said Mr. Hardman. “I’m&#160;not saying anything at all. I’m&#160;just full of natural&#160;<br/>
admiration. What about the other two you haven’t had a guess at yet?&#160;The old American dame,&#160;<br/>and the lady’s-maid?&#160;I suppose we&#160;can take it that they’re the only innocent parties on the train?”&#160;<br/>
“Unless,” said Poirot, smiling, “we can fit them&#160;into our little collection as—shall we say—<br/>
housekeeper and cook in the Armstrong household?”&#160;<br/>
“Well, nothing in the world would surprise&#160;me&#160;now,” said Mr. Hardman with quiet&#160;<br/>
resignation. “Bughouse—that’s what&#160;this business is—bughouse!”&#160;<br/>

“Ah!&#160;&#160;<i>mon cher</i>, that would be indeed stretching coincidence a little too&#160;far,” said M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>
“They cannot all be in it.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked at him. “You do not understand,” he said. “You do not understand at all. Tell&#160;<br/>
me, do you know who killed Ratchett?”&#160;<br/>
“Do you?” countered M. Bouc.&#160;<br/>Poirot nodded. “Oh, yes,” he said. “I have known&#160;for some time. It is so clear that I wonder&#160;<br/>
you have not seen it also.” He looked at Hardman and asked: “And you?”&#160;<br/>
The detective shook his head. He stared at Poirot curiously. “I don’t know,” he said. “I don’t&#160;<br/>
know at all. Which of them&#160;was it?”&#160;<br/>
Poirot was silent a minute. Then he said:&#160;<br/>“If you will be so good, M. Hardman, assemble everyone here. There are two possible&#160;<br/>
solutions of this case. I want to lay them&#160;both before you all.”&#160;<br/>

<b>POIROT PROPOUNDS&#160;TWO SOLUTIONS&#160;</b><br/>
The passengers came&#160;crowding into the restaurant&#160;car and took their seats round the tables. They&#160;<br/>all bore more or less the same expression, one&#160;of expectancy mingled with apprehension. The&#160;<br/>Swedish lady was still weeping, and Mrs. Hubbard was comforting her.&#160;<br/>
“Now you must just take a hold on yourself, my&#160;dear. Everything’s going to be perfectly all&#160;<br/>
right. You mustn’t lose your grip on yourself. If&#160;one of us is a nasty murderer, we know quite&#160;<br/>well it isn’t you. Why, anyone would be&#160;crazy even to think of such&#160;a thing. You sit here, and I’ll&#160;<br/>stay right by you—and don’t you worry any.” Her voice died away as Poirot stood up.&#160;<br/>
The Wagon Lit conductor was hovering in the doorway. “You permit that I stay, Monsieur?”&#160;<br/>“Certainly, Michel.”&#160;<br/>Poirot cleared his throat.&#160;<br/>“<i>Messieurs et mesdames</i>, I will speak in English since I think all of you know a little of that&#160;<br/>
language. We are here to investigate the death of Samuel Edward Ratchett—<i>alias</i>&#160;Cassetti. There&#160;<br/>are two possible solutions&#160;of the crime. I shall put them&#160;both before you, and I shall ask M.&#160;<br/>Bouc, and Dr. Constantine here to judge which solution is the right one.&#160;<br/>
“Now you all know the facts of&#160;the case. Mr. Ratchett was found stabbed this morning. He&#160;<br/>
was last known to be alive at&#160;12.37 last night when he spoke to&#160;the Wagon Lit conductor through&#160;<br/>the door. A watch in his pyjama pocket was found&#160;to be badly dented,&#160;and it had stopped at a&#160;<br/>quarter past one. Dr. Constantine, who examined&#160;the body when found, puts&#160;the time of death as&#160;<br/>having been between midnight and two in the morning. At half an hour after midnight, as you all&#160;<br/>know, the train ran into a snowdrift. After that time&#160;<i>it was impossible for anyone to leave the&#160;<br/>train</i>.&#160;<br/>
“The evidence of Mr. Hardman, who is a member of a New York detective agency—”&#160;<br/>
(Several heads turned, to look at Mr. Hardman.)—“shows that no one could have passed his&#160;<br/>compartment (No. 16 at the extreme end) without being seen by him. We&#160;are therefore forced to&#160;<br/>the conclusion that the murderer&#160;is to be found among the occupants of one particular coach—<br/>the Stamboul-Calais coach.&#160;<br/>
“That, I will say,&#160;<i>was</i>&#160;our theory.”&#160;<br/>“<i>Comment</i>?” ejaculated M. Bouc, startled.&#160;<br/>“But I will put before you an&#160;alternative&#160;theory.&#160;It is very simple. Mr. Ratchett had&#160;a certain&#160;<br/>
enemy whom he feared. He gave Mr. Hardman a description of&#160;this enemy and told him that the&#160;<br/>attempt, if made at all, would most probably be made on the second night out from&#160;Stamboul.&#160;<br/>
“Now I put it to you, ladies and&#160;gentlemen, that Mr. Ratchett knew a good deal more than he&#160;<br/>
told. The enemy, as Mr. Ratchett expected, joined&#160;the train&#160;<i>at Belgrade or else at Vincovci&#160;</i>by the&#160;<br/>door left open by Colonel Arbuthnot and Mr.&#160;MacQueen, who had just descended to the&#160;<br/>platform. He was provided with a suit of Wagon&#160;Lit uniform, which he wore over his ordinary&#160;<br/>clothes, and a pass-key&#160;which enabled him&#160;to gain&#160;access to Mr. Ratchett’s&#160;compartment in spite&#160;<br/>of the door’s being locked. Mr. Ratchett was under&#160;the influence of a sleeping draught. This man&#160;<br/>stabbed him&#160;with great ferocity and left&#160;the compartment through the communicating door&#160;<br/>leading to Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment—”&#160;<br/>
“That’s so,” said Mrs. Hubbard, nodding her head.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
130<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=131></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
“He thrust the dagger he had used into Mrs. Hubbard’s sponge-bag&#160;in passing. Without&#160;<br/>
knowing it, he lost a button of his uniform. Then&#160;he slipped out of the compartment and along&#160;<br/>the corridor.&#160;He hastily thrust the uniform into&#160;a suitcase in&#160;an empty compartment, and a few&#160;<br/>minutes later, dressed in ordinary&#160;clothes, he left the train just&#160;before it started off, using the&#160;<br/>same&#160;means for egress—the door near the dining-car.”&#160;<br/>
Everybody gasped.&#160;<br/>“What about that watch?” demanded Mr. Hardman.&#160;<br/>“There you have the explanation of the whole thing.&#160;<i>Mr. Ratchett had omitted to put his watch&#160;</i><br/>
<i>back an hour as he should have done at Tzaribrod</i>. His watch still registered Eastern European&#160;<br/>time, which is one hour ahead of&#160;Central European time. It was a&#160;quarter past twelve when Mr.&#160;<br/>Ratchett was stabbed—not a quarter past one.”&#160;<br/>
“But it is absurd, that explanation!” cried M. Bouc. “What of&#160;the voice that spoke from&#160;the&#160;<br/>
compartment at twenty-three minutes to one? It was&#160;either the voice of Ratchett—or else that of&#160;<br/>his murderer.”&#160;<br/>
“Not necessarily. It might have&#160;been—well—a third person. One who had gone in to speak to&#160;<br/>
Ratchett and found him dead. He rang the bell to&#160;summon the conductor; then, as you express it,&#160;<br/>the wind rose in him—he was afraid&#160;of being accused of the crime, and he spoke pretending to&#160;<br/>be Ratchett.”&#160;<br/>
“<i>C’est possible</i>,” admitted M. Bouc grudgingly.&#160;<br/>Poirot looked at Mrs. Hubbard. “Yes, Madame, you were going to say—”&#160;<br/>“Well, I don’t quite know what I was going to&#160;say. Do you think I forgot to put my&#160;watch&#160;<br/>
back too?”&#160;<br/>
“No, Madame. I think you heard the man pass through—but unconsciously. Later you had a&#160;<br/>
nightmare of a man being in your compartment and woke up with a start and rang for the&#160;<br/>conductor.”&#160;<br/>
“Well, I suppose that’s possible,” admitted Mrs. Hubbard.&#160;<br/>Princess Dragomiroff was looking&#160;at Poirot with a very direct glance. “How do you explain&#160;<br/>
the evidence of my&#160;maid, Monsieur?”&#160;<br/>
“Very simply, Madame. Your maid recognised&#160;the handkerchief I showed her as yours. She&#160;<br/>
somewhat clumsily tried to shield you. She did encounter the man, but&#160;earlier—while the train&#160;<br/>was at Vincovci station. She pretended to have seen him&#160;at a&#160;later hour, with a confused idea of&#160;<br/>giving you a water-tight alibi.”&#160;<br/>
The Princess bowed her head. “You have thought of everything, Monsieur. I—I admire you.”&#160;<br/>There was a silence.&#160;<br/>Then everyone jumped as Dr. Constantine suddenly hit the table a blow with his fist.&#160;<br/>“But no,” he said. “No, no, and again no! That is an&#160;explanation that will&#160;not hold water. It is&#160;<br/>
deficient in a dozen minor points. The crime was not committed so—M. Poirot must know that&#160;<br/>perfectly well.”&#160;<br/>
Poirot turned a curious glance on him.&#160;“I see,” he said, “that I shall have to give you my&#160;<br/>
second solution. But do not abandon this one too abruptly. You may agree with it later.”&#160;<br/>
He turned back again to face the others.&#160;<br/>“There is another possible solution of the crime. This is how I arrived at it.&#160;<br/>“When I had heard all the evidence, I leaned back and shut my&#160;eyes, and began to&#160;<i>think</i>.&#160;<br/>
Certain points presented themselves to me&#160;as worthy of attention. I enumerated these points to&#160;<br/>my two colleagues. Some I have already elucidated—such as a grease spot on a passport, and so&#160;<br/>on. I will run over the points that remain. The first&#160;and most important is&#160;a remark made to me by&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>

<a name=132></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
M. Bouc in the restaurant car at lunch on the first day after leaving Stamboul—to the effect that&#160;<br/>the company assembled was interesting&#160;because it&#160;was so varied—representing&#160;as it did&#160;all&#160;<br/>classes and nationalities.&#160;<br/>
“I agreed with him,&#160;but when this particular&#160;point came into my&#160;mind, I tried to&#160;imagine&#160;<br/>
whether such an assembly was ever likely to&#160;be collected under any&#160;other conditions. And the&#160;<br/>answer I made to myself was—only in America. In America there might be a household&#160;<br/>composed of just such varied nationalities—an Italian chauffeur, an English governess, a&#160;<br/>Swedish nurse, a German lady’s-maid, and so on.&#160;That led&#160;me to&#160;my&#160;scheme&#160;of ‘guessing’—that&#160;<br/>is, casting each person for a certain part in the&#160;Armstrong drama much as a producer casts a play.&#160;<br/>Well, that gave me an extremely&#160;interesting and satisfactory result.&#160;<br/>
“I had also examined in my&#160;own mind each separate person’s evidence, with some curious&#160;<br/>
results. Take first the evidence of&#160;Mr. MacQueen. My first interview with him&#160;was entirely&#160;<br/>satisfactory. But in my&#160;second he made rather&#160;a curious remark. I had described to him&#160;the&#160;<br/>finding of a note mentioning the Armstrong case. He&#160;said, ‘But surely—’&#160;and then paused and&#160;<br/>went on, ‘I mean—that was rather careless of the old man.’&#160;<br/>
“Now I could feel that that was not what he had started out to say.&#160;<i>Supposing what he had&#160;</i><br/>
<i>meant to say was ‘But surely that was burnt!’&#160;</i>In which case,&#160;<i>MacQueen knew of the note and of&#160;<br/>its destruction</i>—in other words, he was either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer.&#160;<br/>Very good.&#160;<br/>
“Then the valet. He said his master was in&#160;the habit of taking a sleeping draught when&#160;<br/>
travelling by train. That might be true,&#160;<i>but would Ratchett have&#160;taken one last night</i>? The&#160;<br/>automatic under his pillow gave the lie to that statement. Ratchett intended to be on the alert last&#160;<br/>night. Whatever narcotic was administered to&#160;him must have been given without his knowledge.&#160;<br/>By whom?&#160;Obviously by MacQueen or the valet.&#160;<br/>
“Now we come&#160;to the evidence of Mr. Hardman.&#160;I believed all that he&#160;told me&#160;about his own&#160;<br/>
identity, but when it came to the actual methods he had employed to&#160;guard Mr. Ratchett, his&#160;<br/>story was neither more nor less than absurd. The&#160;only way to have protected Ratchett effectively&#160;<br/>was to pass the night actually in his compartment&#160;or in some spot where&#160;he could watch the door.&#160;<br/>The one thing that his evidence&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;show plainly was that&#160;<i>no one in any other part of the train&#160;<br/>could possibly have murdered Ratchett</i>. It drew a clear circle&#160;round the Stamboul-Calais&#160;<br/>carriage. That seemed to me a rather curious and inexplicable fact, and I put it aside to think&#160;<br/>over.&#160;<br/>
“You probably all know by now of the few words I overheard between Miss Debenham&#160;and&#160;<br/>
Colonel Arbuthnot. The interesting thing to my mind was the fact that&#160;Colonel Arbuthnot called&#160;<br/>her&#160;<i>Mary</i>&#160;and was clearly on terms of&#160;intimacy with her. But the Colonel was supposed to have&#160;<br/>met her only a few days previously. And I know Englishmen of the Colonel’s type—even if he&#160;<br/>had fallen in love with the young lady at first sight, he would have advanced slowly and with&#160;<br/>decorum, not rushing things. Therefore I concluded that Colonel Arbuthnot and Miss Debenham&#160;<br/>were in reality well acquainted and&#160;were for&#160;some&#160;reason pretending to be strangers. Another&#160;<br/>small point was Miss&#160;Debenham’s easy familiarity&#160;with&#160;the term&#160;‘long distance’ for a telephone&#160;<br/>call. Yet Miss Debenham had told me&#160;that&#160;she had never been in the States.&#160;<br/>
“To pass to another witness. Mrs. Hubbard had told us that lying in bed she had been unable&#160;<br/>
to see whether the communicating door was bolted or not, and so had asked Miss Ohlsson to see&#160;<br/>for her. Now—though her statement would have been perfectly true if she had been occupying&#160;<br/>compartment No. 2, 4, 12 or any&#160;<i>even</i>&#160;number, in which the bolt is directly under the handle of&#160;<br/>the door—in the&#160;<i>uneven</i>&#160;numbers such as compartment No. 3 the bolt is well&#160;<i>above</i>&#160;the handle&#160;<br/>

and could not therefore be masked by the sponge-bag&#160;in the least. I was forced to the conclusion&#160;<br/>that Mrs. Hubbard was inventing an&#160;incident that had never occurred.&#160;<br/>
“And here let me&#160;say just a word or two about&#160;<i>times</i>. To my&#160;mind the really interesting point&#160;<br/>
about the dented watch, is the place where&#160;it was found—in Ratchett’s pyjama&#160;pocket, a&#160;<br/>singularly uncomfortable and unlikely place to keep&#160;one’s watch, especially&#160;as there is a watch&#160;<br/>‘hook’ provided just by the head of the bed. I&#160;felt sure, therefore, that the watch had been&#160;<br/>deliberately placed in the pocket—faked. The crime, then, was not committed at a quarter&#160;past&#160;<br/>one.&#160;<br/>
“Was it then&#160;committed earlier? To&#160;be exact, at twenty-three minutes to&#160;one? My friend M.&#160;<br/>
Bouc advanced as an argument in favour of it&#160;the loud cry which awoke me&#160;from&#160;sleep. But if&#160;<br/>Ratchett had been heavily drugged,&#160;<i>he could not have cried out</i>. If he had been capable of crying&#160;<br/>out, he would have been capable of making some&#160;kind of struggle to defend himself, and there&#160;<br/>were no signs of any such struggle.&#160;<br/>
“I remembered that MacQueen had called attention, not once but twice (and the second time&#160;<br/>
in a very blatant manner), to the&#160;fact that&#160;Ratchett could&#160;speak no French. I came to the&#160;<br/>conclusion that the whole business at twenty-three minutes to one was a&#160;comedy played for my&#160;<br/>benefit! Anyone might&#160;see through the watch business—it is a common enough device in&#160;<br/>detective stories. They assumed that I&#160;<i>should</i>&#160;see through it and that, pluming myself on my&#160;own&#160;<br/>cleverness, I would go on to assume&#160;that since&#160;Ratchett spoke no French, the voice I heard at&#160;<br/>twenty-three minutes to one could not have been&#160;his, and&#160;that Ratchett must have been already&#160;<br/>dead. But I am&#160;convinced that at twenty-three&#160;minutes to one Ratchett&#160;was still lying in his&#160;<br/>drugged sleep.&#160;<br/>
“But the device has succeeded! I have opened my&#160;door and looked out. I have actually heard&#160;<br/>
the French phrase used. If I am so unbelievably dense as not to realise the significance of that&#160;<br/>phrase, it must be brought to my&#160;attention. If necessary, MacQueen can come&#160;right out in the&#160;<br/>open. He can say, ‘Excuse me, M. Poirot,&#160;<i>that can’t have been Mr. Ratchett speaking</i>. He&#160;<br/>couldn’t speak French.’&#160;<br/>
“Now, what was the real time of&#160;the crime? And who killed him?&#160;<br/>“In my opinion—and this is only an opinion—Ratchett was killed at some time very close&#160;<br/>
upon two o’clock, the latest hour the doctor gives us as possible.&#160;<br/>
“As to who killed him—”&#160;<br/>He paused, looking at his audience. He could not&#160;complain of any lack of attention. Every eye&#160;<br/>
was fixed upon him. In the stillness you could have heard a pin drop.&#160;<br/>
He went on slowly:&#160;<br/>“I was particularly struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving a case against any one&#160;<br/>
person on the train, and by the rather curious coincidence that in&#160;each case the testimony giving&#160;<br/>an alibi came&#160;from what I might describe as&#160;an ‘unlikely’ person. Thus, Mr. MacQueen and&#160;<br/>Colonel Arbuthnot provided alibis for each&#160;other—two persons between&#160;whom&#160;it seemed most&#160;<br/>unlikely there should have been&#160;any prior acquaintanceship. The same&#160;thing happened with the&#160;<br/>English valet and the Italian, and with the Swedish lady and&#160;the English&#160;girl. I said to myself:&#160;<br/>This is extraordinary—they cannot&#160;<i>all</i>&#160;be in it!&#160;<br/>
“And then, Messieurs, I saw light. They&#160;<i>were</i>&#160;all in it. For so many people connected with the&#160;<br/>
Armstrong case to be travelling by the same&#160;train through coincidence was not only unlikely: it&#160;<br/>was&#160;&#160;<i>impossible</i>.&#160;It must be not chance, but&#160;<i>design</i>.&#160;I remembered a remark of Colonel&#160;<br/>Arbuthnot’s about trial by jury. A jury is composed of twelve people—there were twelve&#160;<br/>passengers—Ratchett was stabbed twelve times. And the thing that had worried me&#160;all along—<br/>
&#160;<br/>
133<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=134></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
the extraordinary crowd travelling in the Stamboul-Calais coach at a slack time&#160;of year—this was&#160;<br/>explained.&#160;<br/>
“Ratchett had escaped justice in America. There was no question as to his guilt. I visualised a&#160;<br/>
self-appointed jury of twelve people who&#160;had condemned him&#160;to death and who by the&#160;<br/>exigencies of&#160;the case had themselves been forced to be his executioners. And immediately, on&#160;<br/>that assumption, the whole case fell into beautiful shining order.&#160;<br/>
“I saw it as a perfect mosaic, each&#160;person playing his or&#160;her allotted part. It was so&#160;arranged&#160;<br/>
that, if suspicion should fall on any one person, the evidence of one&#160;or more of the others would&#160;<br/>clear the accused person and confuse the issue.&#160;Hardman’s evidence was necessary in&#160;case some&#160;<br/>outsider should be suspected of the crime and be&#160;unable to prove an alibi.&#160;The passengers in the&#160;<br/>Stamboul carriage were in no danger. Every minute detail of their evidence was worked out&#160;<br/>beforehand. The whole thing was a&#160;very cleverly planned jigsaw puzzle, so arranged that every&#160;<br/>fresh piece of knowledge that came&#160;to light made the solution&#160;of the whole more difficult. As my&#160;<br/>friend M. Bouc remarked, the case seemed fantastically&#160;impossible! That was&#160;exactly the&#160;<br/>impression intended to be conveyed.&#160;<br/>
“Did this solution explain everything? Yes, it&#160;did. The nature of the wounds—each inflicted&#160;<br/>
by a different person. The artificial threatening letters—artificial since they were unreal, written&#160;<br/>only to be produced as evidence.&#160;(Doubtless&#160;there&#160;<i>were</i>&#160;real letters,&#160;warning Ratchett of&#160;his fate,&#160;<br/>which MacQueen destroyed, substituting for them&#160;these others.) Then Hardman’s story of being&#160;<br/>called in by Ratchett—a lie, of course, from&#160;beginning to end. The description of the mythical&#160;<br/>‘small dark man with a womanish voice’—a convenient description since it&#160;had the merit of not&#160;<br/>incriminating any of the actual Wagon Lit conductors and would apply equally well to a man or&#160;<br/>a woman.&#160;<br/>
“The idea of stabbing is at first sight a curious one, but on reflection nothing else&#160;would fit the&#160;<br/>
circumstances so well. A dagger was a weapon&#160;that could be used by everyone—strong or&#160;<br/>weak—and it made no noise. I fancy, though I may&#160;be wrong, that each person in turn entered&#160;<br/>Ratchett’s darkened compartment through that&#160;of Mrs. Hubbard—and struck! They themselves&#160;<br/>would never know which blow actually killed him.&#160;<br/>
“The final letter which Ratchett had&#160;probably&#160;found on his pillow was carefully burnt. With&#160;<br/>
no clue pointing to the Armstrong&#160;case there would be&#160;absolutely no&#160;reason for suspecting any of&#160;<br/>the passengers on the train. It would be put down as&#160;an outside job, and the ‘small dark man with&#160;<br/>the womanish voice’ would actually have been seen&#160;by one or more of the passengers leaving the&#160;<br/>train, at Brod!&#160;<br/>
“I do not know exactly&#160;what happened when the conspirators&#160;discovered&#160;that&#160;this&#160;part of their&#160;<br/>
plan was impossible owing to the accident to&#160;the train. There was, I imagine, a hasty&#160;<br/>consultation, and then they decided to go through with it. It was true that&#160;now one and all of&#160;the&#160;<br/>passengers were bound to come&#160;under suspicion, but&#160;that possibility had already been foreseen&#160;<br/>and provided for. The only additional thing to be done was to confuse the issue even further.&#160;<br/>Two so-called ‘clues’ were dropped in the dead&#160;man’s compartment—one incriminating Colonel&#160;<br/>Arbuthnot (who had the strongest alibi and whose connection with the Armstrong family was&#160;<br/>probably the hardest to prove);&#160;and the second clue, the handkerchief, incriminating Princess&#160;<br/>Dragomiroff who, by virtue of her social position, her particularly frail physique and the alibi&#160;<br/>given her by her maid and the conductor, was practically in an unassailable position.&#160;<br/>
“Further to confuse the issue, a red&#160;herring&#160;was drawn across the trail—the mythical woman&#160;<br/>
in the red kimono. Again I am&#160;to&#160;bear witness to this woman’s existence. There is a heavy bang&#160;<br/>at my&#160;door. I get up and look out—and see the scarlet kimono disappearing in the distance. A&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
134<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=135></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
judicious selection of people—the conductor,&#160;Miss Debenham&#160;and MacQueen—will also have&#160;<br/>seen her. It was, I think, someone with a&#160;sense of humour who thoughtfully placed the scarlet&#160;<br/>kimono on the top of my suitcase whilst I was interviewing people in the&#160;dining-car. Where the&#160;<br/>garment came from&#160;in the first place, I do not know. I suspect it is the property of Countess&#160;<br/>Andrenyi, since her luggage contained only a chiffon negligee so elaborate as to be rather a tea-<br/>gown than a dressing-gown.&#160;<br/>
“When MacQueen first learned that the letter which had been so carefully burnt had in part&#160;<br/>
escaped destruction, and that the word Armstrong&#160;was exactly the word remaining, he must at&#160;<br/>once have communicated his news, to the others.&#160;It&#160;was at this minute that&#160;the&#160;position of&#160;<br/>Countess Andrenyi became&#160;acute, and her husband&#160;immediately took steps to alter the passport.&#160;<br/>It was their second piece of bad luck!&#160;<br/>
“They one and all agreed to deny utterly any connection with the Armstrong family. They&#160;<br/>
knew I had no immediate means of finding out the truth, and they did not believe that I should go&#160;<br/>into the matter unless my&#160;suspicions were&#160;aroused against one particular person.&#160;<br/>
“Now there was one further point to consider.&#160;Allowing that my&#160;theory of&#160;the crime was the&#160;<br/>
correct one, and I believed that it&#160;<i>must</i>&#160;be the correct one, then obviously the Wagon Lit&#160;<br/>conductor himself must be privy to&#160;the plot. But if so, that gave&#160;us thirteen persons, not twelve.&#160;<br/>Instead of the usual formula ‘Of so many people one&#160;is guilty,’ I was faced with the problem&#160;that&#160;<br/>of thirteen persons one and one only&#160;was innocent. Which was that person?&#160;<br/>
“I came to a&#160;very odd conclusion. I came&#160;to the conclusion that the person who had taken no&#160;<br/>
part in the crime was the person who would be considered the most likely to do so. I refer to&#160;<br/>Countess Andrenyi. I was impressed by the earnestness of her husband when he swore to me&#160;<br/>solemnly on his honour that his wife never left&#160;her compartment that night. I decided that Count&#160;<br/>Andrenyi took, so to speak, his wife’s place.&#160;<br/>
“If so, then Pierre Michel was definitely one&#160;of the twelve. But how could one explain his&#160;<br/>
complicity?&#160;He was a decent man who had been&#160;many years in the employ of the company—not&#160;<br/>the kind of man who could be bribed to assist in&#160;a crime. Then Pierre Michel must be involved in&#160;<br/>the Armstrong case. But that seemed very improbable. Then I remembered that the dead nursery-<br/>maid had been French. Supposing that that unfortunate girl had been Pierre Michel’s daughter.&#160;<br/>That would explain everything—it&#160;would also explain the place chosen for the staging of the&#160;<br/>crime. Were there any others whose part in the drama was not clear?&#160;Colonel Arbuthnot I put&#160;<br/>down as a friend of the Armstrongs. They had probably been through the War together. The&#160;<br/>maid, Hildegarde Schmidt—I could guess her place in the Armstrong household. I am, perhaps,&#160;<br/>over greedy, but I sense a good cook instinctively. I laid a&#160;trap for her—she fell&#160;into it. I said I&#160;<br/>knew she was a good cook. She answered: ‘Yes, indeed,&#160;all my&#160;ladies have said so.’ But if you&#160;<br/>are employed as a&#160;<i>lady’s-maid&#160;</i>your employers seldom&#160;have a chance of learning whether or not&#160;<br/>you are a good cook.&#160;<br/>
“Then there was Hardman. He seemed quite definitely not to belong to the Armstrong&#160;<br/>
household. I could only imagine that&#160;he had been in love with the&#160;French girl. I spoke to him&#160;of&#160;<br/>the charm&#160;of foreign women—and again I obtained the reaction I was looking for. Sudden tears&#160;<br/>came into his eyes, which he pretended were dazzled by the snow.&#160;<br/>
“There remains Mrs. Hubbard. Now Mrs. Hubbard,&#160;let me&#160;say, played the&#160;most important part&#160;<br/>
in the drama. By occupying the compartment communicating with that&#160;of&#160;Ratchett she was more&#160;<br/>open to suspicion than anyone&#160;else. In the nature of things she could not have an alibi to fall back&#160;<br/>upon. To play the part she played—the perfectly natural, slightly ridiculous American fond&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
135<br/>

<a name=136></a><b>Agatha&#160;Christie&#160;</b><b>&#160;MURDER ON&#160;THE ORIENT EXPRESS&#160;</b><br/>
mother—an artist was needed. But there&#160;<i>was</i>&#160;an artist connected with the Armstrong family: Mrs.&#160;<br/>Armstrong’s mother—Linda Arden, the actress . ...”&#160;<br/>
He stopped.&#160;<br/>Then in a soft rich dreamy voice, quite unlike the one she had used throughout the journey,&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Hubbard said:&#160;<br/>
“I always fancied myself in comedy parts.”&#160;<br/>She went on, still dreamily:&#160;<br/>“That slip about the sponge-bag was silly. It shows that you should always rehearse property.&#160;<br/>
We tried it on the way out—I was in an even-number compartment then, I suppose. I never&#160;<br/>thought of the bolts being in different places.”&#160;<br/>
She shifted her position a little and looked straight at Poirot.&#160;<br/>“You know all about it, M. Poirot. You’re a&#160;very wonderful man. But even you can’t quite&#160;<br/>
imagine what it was&#160;like—that awful day&#160;in&#160;New York. I was just&#160;crazy&#160;with grief;&#160;so were&#160;the&#160;<br/>servants. And Colonel Arbuthnot was there too. He was John Armstrong’s best friend.”&#160;<br/>
“He saved my life in the War,” said Arbuthnot.&#160;<br/>“We decided then and there (perhaps we were&#160;mad—I don’t know) that the sentence of death&#160;<br/>
that Cassetti had escaped had got to&#160;be carried&#160;out. There were twelve of&#160;us—or rather eleven;&#160;<br/>Susanne’s father was over in France, of course. First we thought we’d draw&#160;lots as to who should&#160;<br/>do it, but in the end we decided on this way.&#160;It was the chauffeur, Antonio, who suggested it.&#160;<br/>Mary worked&#160;out all the&#160;details later with Hector MacQueen. He’d always adored Sonia—my&#160;<br/>daughter—and it was he who explained to us exactly how Cassetti’s money had managed to get&#160;<br/>him off.&#160;<br/>
“It took a long time to perfect our plan. We&#160;had first to track Ratchett down. Hardman&#160;<br/>
managed that in the end. Then we had to&#160;try and get Masterman and Hector into his&#160;<br/>employment—or at any rate one of them. Well,&#160;we managed that. Then we had a consultation&#160;<br/>with Susanne’s father. Colonel Arbuthnot was very&#160;keen on having twelve of us. He seemed to&#160;<br/>think it made it more in&#160;order. He didn’t like&#160;the stabbing idea much, but he agreed&#160;that it did&#160;<br/>solve most of&#160;our difficulties. Well, Susanne’s&#160;father was willing.&#160;Susanne had been his only&#160;<br/>child. We knew from&#160;Hector that&#160;Ratchett would be coming back from the East sooner or later&#160;<br/>by the Orient Express. With Pierre Michel actually working on that train, the chance was too&#160;<br/>good to be missed. Besides, it would be a good&#160;way of not incriminating any outsiders.&#160;<br/>
“My daughter’s husband had to know, of course, and he insisted on coming on the train with&#160;<br/>
her. Hector&#160;wangled it so&#160;that Ratchett selected&#160;the right day&#160;for travelling, when Michel would&#160;<br/>be on duty. We meant to engage&#160;every carriage in&#160;the Stamboul-Calais coach, but unfortunately&#160;<br/>there was one carriage we&#160;couldn’t get. It had been&#160;reserved long beforehand for a director of the&#160;<br/>company. ‘Mr. Harris,’ of course, was a myth.&#160;But it would have been awkward to have any&#160;<br/>stranger in Hector’s compartment.&#160;And then, at the last minute,&#160;<i>you</i>&#160;came. ...”&#160;<br/>
She stopped.&#160;<br/>“Well,” she said, “you know everything now, M.&#160;Poirot. What&#160;are you going to do about it?&#160;If&#160;<br/>
it must all come&#160;out, can’t you lay the blame upon&#160;me&#160;and me&#160;only?&#160;I would have stabbed that&#160;<br/>man twelve times willingly. It wasn’t only that&#160;he was responsible for my daughter’s death and&#160;<br/>her child’s and that of the other child who might have been&#160;alive and happy now. It was more&#160;<br/>than that: there had&#160;been&#160;other&#160;children kidnapped before Daisy, and there might be others in the&#160;<br/>future. Society had condemned him—we were&#160;only carrying out the sentence.&#160;But it’s&#160;<br/>unnecessary to bring all these others into it.&#160;All these good faithful souls—and poor Michel-and&#160;<br/>Mary and Colonel Arbuthnot—they love each other. ...”&#160;<br/>

Her voice was wonderful, echoing through the crowded space—that deep, emotional, heart-<br/>
stirring voice that had thrilled many a New York audience.&#160;<br/>
Poirot looked at his friend.&#160;<br/>“You are a director of the company, M.&#160;Bouc,” he said. “What do you say?”&#160;<br/>M. Bouc cleared his throat.&#160;<br/>“In my opinion, M. Poirot,” he said, “the first theory you put forward was the correct one—<br/>
decidedly so. I suggest that that is the solution we offer to the Jugo-Slavian police when they&#160;<br/>arrive. You agree, doctor?”&#160;<br/>
“Certainly I agree,” said Dr.&#160;Constantine. “As regards the medical evidence, I think—er—that&#160;<br/>
I made one or two fantastic suggestions.”&#160;<br/>
“Then,” said&#160;Poirot, “having placed my solution&#160;before you, I have the honour to&#160;retire from&#160;<br/>
the case. ...”&#160;<br/>
