<b>Chapter 1</b><br/>
When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the&#160;<br/>
elbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were&#160;<br/>
assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was&#160;<br/>
somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand&#160;<br/>
was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have&#160;<br/>
cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.<br/>
When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we&#160;<br/>
sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells&#160;<br/>
started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before&#160;<br/>
that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea&#160;<br/>
of making Boo Radley come out.<br/>
I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew&#160;<br/>
Jackson. If General Jackson hadn’t run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch&#160;<br/>
would never have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadn’t?&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4></a>We were far too old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted&#160;<br/>
Atticus. Our father said we were both right.<br/>
Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that&#160;<br/>
we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had&#160;<br/>
was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was&#160;<br/>
exceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the&#160;<br/>
persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more&#160;<br/>
liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way&#160;<br/>
across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up&#160;<br/>
the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley’s strictures on the use of many words&#160;<br/>
in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit&#160;<br/>
he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory&#160;<br/>
of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten&#160;<br/>
his teacher’s dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and&#160;<br/>
with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some&#160;<br/>
forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find&#160;<br/>
a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to&#160;<br/>
an impressive age and died rich.<br/>
It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon’s homestead,&#160;<br/>
Finch’s Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient:&#160;<br/>
modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless&#160;<br/>
produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles&#160;<br/>
of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile.<br/>
Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North&#160;<br/>
and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet&#160;<br/>
the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth&#160;<br/>
century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his&#160;<br/>
younger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the&#160;<br/>
Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most&#160;<br/>
of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full.<br/>
When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his&#160;<br/>
practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch’s Landing, was the county&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>seat of Maycomb County. Atticus’s office in the courthouse contained little more&#160;<br/>
than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His&#160;<br/>
first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail.&#160;<br/>
Atticus had urged them to accept the state’s generosity in allowing them to plead&#160;<br/>
Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were&#160;<br/>
Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The&#160;<br/>
Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb’s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding&#160;<br/>
arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to&#160;<br/>
do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-<br/>
coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in&#160;<br/>
pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus&#160;<br/>
could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was&#160;<br/>
probably the beginning of my father’s profound distaste for the practice of&#160;<br/>
criminal law.<br/>
During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than&#160;<br/>
anything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brother’s&#160;<br/>
education. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to&#160;<br/>
study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting&#160;<br/>
Uncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked&#160;<br/>
Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they&#160;<br/>
knew him, and because of Simon Finch’s industry, Atticus was related by blood&#160;<br/>
or marriage to nearly every family in the town.<br/>
Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In&#160;<br/>
rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the&#160;<br/>
courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog&#160;<br/>
suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in&#160;<br/>
the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men’s stiff collars wilted by&#160;<br/>
nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o’clock naps,&#160;<br/>
and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.<br/>
People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of&#160;<br/>
the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go,&#160;<br/>
nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries&#160;<br/>
of Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people:&#160;<br/>
Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.<br/>
We lived on the main residential street in town— Atticus, Jem and I, plus&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us,&#160;<br/>
read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.<br/>
Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was&#160;<br/>
nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She&#160;<br/>
was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldn’t behave as&#160;<br/>
well as Jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasn’t&#160;<br/>
ready to come. Our battles were epic and one-sided. Calpurnia always won,&#160;<br/>
mainly because Atticus always took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem&#160;<br/>
was born, and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember.<br/>
Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham&#160;<br/>
from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state&#160;<br/>
legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was&#160;<br/>
the product of their first year of marriage; four years later I was born, and two&#160;<br/>
years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her&#160;<br/>
family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and&#160;<br/>
sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play&#160;<br/>
by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to&#160;<br/>
bother him.<br/>
When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries&#160;<br/>
(within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose’s house&#160;<br/>
two doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We&#160;<br/>
were never tempted to break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an&#160;<br/>
unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for&#160;<br/>
days on end; Mrs. Dubose was plain hell.<br/>
That was the summer Dill came to us.<br/>
Early one morning as we were beginning our day’s play in the back yard, Jem and&#160;<br/>
I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford’s collard patch. We went&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a>to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy— Miss Rachel’s rat terrier was&#160;<br/>
expecting— instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he&#160;<br/>
wasn’t much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke:<br/>
“Hey.”<br/>
“Hey yourself,” said Jem pleasantly.<br/>
“I’m Charles Baker Harris,” he said. “I can read.”<br/>
“So what?” I said.<br/>
“I just thought you’d like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin‘ I&#160;<br/>
can do it…”<br/>
“How old are you,” asked Jem, “four-and-a-half?”<br/>
“Goin‘ on seven.”<br/>
“Shoot no wonder, then,” said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. “Scout yonder’s&#160;<br/>
been readin‘ ever since she was born, and she ain’t even started to school yet. You&#160;<br/>
look right puny for goin’ on seven.”<br/>
“I’m little but I’m old,” he said.<br/>
Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. “Why don’t you come over,&#160;<br/>
Charles Baker Harris?” he said. “Lord, what a name.”<br/>
“‘s not any funnier’n yours. Aunt Rachel says your name’s Jeremy Atticus Finch.”<br/>
Jem scowled. “I’m big enough to fit mine,” he said. “Your name’s longer’n you&#160;<br/>
are. Bet it’s a foot longer.”<br/>
“Folks call me Dill,” said Dill, struggling under the fence.<br/>
“Do better if you go over it instead of under it,” I said. “Where’d you come from?”<br/>
Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt,&#160;<br/>
Miss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on.&#160;<br/>
His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a&#160;<br/>
photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and&#160;<br/>
won five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show&#160;<br/>
twenty times on it.<br/>
“Don’t have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse&#160;<br/>
sometimes,” said Jem. “Ever see anything good?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>Dill had seen&#160;<i>Dracula</i>, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning&#160;<br/>
of respect. “Tell it to us,” he said.<br/>
Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair&#160;<br/>
was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff; he was a year my senior but&#160;<br/>
I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and&#160;<br/>
darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the&#160;<br/>
center of his forehead.<br/>
When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than&#160;<br/>
the book, I asked Dill where his father was: “You ain’t said anything about him.”<br/>
“I haven’t got one.”<br/>
“Is he dead?”<br/>
“No…”<br/>
“Then if he’s not dead you’ve got one, haven’t you?”<br/>
Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and&#160;<br/>
found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine&#160;<br/>
contentment was: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin&#160;<br/>
chinaberry trees in the back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas&#160;<br/>
based on the works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs.&#160;<br/>
In this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character parts formerly&#160;<br/>
thrust upon me— the ape in&#160;<i>Tarzan</i>, Mr. Crabtree in&#160;<i>The Rover Boys</i>, Mr. Damon&#160;<br/>
in&#160;<i>Tom Swift</i>. Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed&#160;<br/>
with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies.<br/>
But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions,&#160;<br/>
and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.<br/>
The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations it&#160;<br/>
drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on&#160;<br/>
the corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm&#160;<br/>
around the fat pole, staring and wondering.<br/>
The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking south, one&#160;<br/>
faced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot. The house was low,&#160;<br/>
was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=9></a>darkened to the color of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles&#160;<br/>
drooped over the eaves of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains&#160;<br/>
of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard— a “swept” yard that was never&#160;<br/>
swept— where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.<br/>
Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and&#160;<br/>
I had never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down,&#160;<br/>
and peeped in windows. When people’s azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was&#160;<br/>
because he had breathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in&#160;<br/>
Maycomb were his work. Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid&#160;<br/>
nocturnal events: people’s chickens and household pets were found mutilated;&#160;<br/>
although the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in&#160;<br/>
Barker’s Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their&#160;<br/>
initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut&#160;<br/>
across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school&#160;<br/>
grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall&#160;<br/>
pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the&#160;<br/>
children: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a&#160;<br/>
lost ball and no questions asked.<br/>
The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The&#160;<br/>
Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection&#160;<br/>
unforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycomb’s principal&#160;<br/>
recreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street&#160;<br/>
for a mid-morning coffee break with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a&#160;<br/>
missionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and&#160;<br/>
came back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the&#160;<br/>
neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew how old Mr.&#160;<br/>
Radley made his living— Jem said he “bought cotton,” a polite term for doing&#160;<br/>
nothing—but Mr. Radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long&#160;<br/>
as anybody could remember.<br/>
The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another&#160;<br/>
thing alien to Maycomb’s ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather&#160;<br/>
only. Of all days Sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore&#160;<br/>
corsets, men wore coats, children wore shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=10></a>and call, “He-y,” of a Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did.&#160;<br/>
The Radley house had no screen doors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any;&#160;<br/>
Atticus said yes, but before I was born.<br/>
According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his&#160;<br/>
teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an&#160;<br/>
enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and&#160;<br/>
they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but&#160;<br/>
enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they&#160;<br/>
hung around the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and&#160;<br/>
went to the picture show; they attended dances at the county’s riverside gambling&#160;<br/>
hell, the Dew-Drop Inn &amp; Fishing Camp; they experimented with stumphole&#160;<br/>
whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr. Radley that his boy&#160;<br/>
was in with the wrong crowd.<br/>
One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square&#160;<br/>
in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycomb’s ancient beadle, Mr. Conner,&#160;<br/>
and locked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to&#160;<br/>
be done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he&#160;<br/>
was bound and determined they wouldn’t get away with it, so the boys came&#160;<br/>
before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace,&#160;<br/>
assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and&#160;<br/>
hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge;&#160;<br/>
Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard&#160;<br/>
them. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where&#160;<br/>
boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and&#160;<br/>
decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was.&#160;<br/>
If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no&#160;<br/>
further trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radley’s word was his bond, the judge was&#160;<br/>
glad to do so.<br/>
The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary&#160;<br/>
education to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through&#160;<br/>
engineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on&#160;<br/>
weekdays as well as Sundays, and Mr. Radley’s boy was not seen again for&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=11></a>fifteen years.<br/>
But there came a day, barely within Jem’s memory, when Boo Radley was heard&#160;<br/>
from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said Atticus never talked&#160;<br/>
much about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus’s only answer&#160;<br/>
was for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a&#160;<br/>
right to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm,&#160;<br/>
mm, mm.”<br/>
So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a&#160;<br/>
neighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss&#160;<br/>
Stephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from&#160;<i>The&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Maycomb Tribune</i>&#160;to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr.&#160;<br/>
Radley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out,&#160;<br/>
wiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.<br/>
Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but&#160;<br/>
when the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the&#160;<br/>
Tribune. He was thirty-three years old then.<br/>
Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum,&#160;<br/>
when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo&#160;<br/>
wasn’t crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not&#160;<br/>
a criminal. The sheriff hadn’t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so&#160;<br/>
Boo was locked in the courthouse basement.<br/>
Boo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory.&#160;<br/>
Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he&#160;<br/>
didn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could&#160;<br/>
not live forever on the bounty of the county.<br/>
Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of&#160;<br/>
sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the&#160;<br/>
time. Atticus said no, it wasn’t that sort of thing, that there were other ways of&#160;<br/>
making people into ghosts.<br/>
My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk&#160;<br/>
to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=12></a>would see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with&#160;<br/>
colorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp&#160;<br/>
and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie&#160;<br/>
Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we&#160;<br/>
believed her, because Mr. Radley’s posture was ramrod straight.<br/>
He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say,&#160;<br/>
“Good morning, sir,” and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radley’s elder son lived&#160;<br/>
in Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we&#160;<br/>
ever saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home,&#160;<br/>
people said the house died.<br/>
But there came a day when Atticus told us he’d wear us out if we made any noise&#160;<br/>
in the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a&#160;<br/>
sound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.<br/>
He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the&#160;<br/>
Radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back&#160;<br/>
street. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the&#160;<br/>
Radley’s every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last&#160;<br/>
the sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch&#160;<br/>
when Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house.<br/>
“There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into,” murmured Calpurnia,&#160;<br/>
and she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.<br/>
The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out,&#160;<br/>
but it had another think coming: Boo’s elder brother returned from Pensacola and&#160;<br/>
took Mr. Radley’s place. The only difference between him and his father was&#160;<br/>
their ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan Radley “bought cotton,” too. Mr. Nathan would&#160;<br/>
speak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him&#160;<br/>
coming from town with a magazine in his hand.<br/>
The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer&#160;<br/>
he would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder.<br/>
“Wonder what he does in there,” he would murmur. “Looks like he’d just stick&#160;<br/>
his head out the door.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=13></a>Jem said, “He goes out, all right, when it’s pitch dark. Miss Stephanie Crawford&#160;<br/>
said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight&#160;<br/>
through the window at her… said his head was like a skull lookin‘ at her. Ain’t&#160;<br/>
you ever waked up at night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this-” Jem slid his&#160;<br/>
feet through the gravel. “Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at&#160;<br/>
night? I’ve seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin’, and one night I heard&#160;<br/>
him scratching on the back screen, but he was gone time Atticus got there.”<br/>
“Wonder what he looks like?” said Dill.<br/>
Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall,&#160;<br/>
judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch,&#160;<br/>
that’s why his hands were bloodstained—if you ate an animal raw, you could&#160;<br/>
never wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face;&#160;<br/>
what teeth he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most&#160;<br/>
of the time.<br/>
“Let’s try to make him come out,” said Dill. “I’d like to see what he looks like.”<br/>
Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do was go up and knock&#160;<br/>
on the front door.<br/>
Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem&#160;<i>The Gray Ghost</i>&#160;against two&#160;<br/>
Tom Swifts that Jem wouldn’t get any farther than the Radley gate. In all his life,&#160;<br/>
Jem had never declined a dare.<br/>
Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more than his head,&#160;<br/>
for Dill wore him down easily: “You’re scared,” Dill said, the first day. “Ain’t&#160;<br/>
scared, just respectful,” Jem said. The next day Dill said, “You’re too scared even&#160;<br/>
to put your big toe in the front yard.” Jem said he reckoned he wasn’t, he’d passed&#160;<br/>
the Radley Place every school day of his life.<br/>
“Always runnin‘,” I said.<br/>
But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly&#160;<br/>
weren’t as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that he’d never seen such scary folks&#160;<br/>
as the ones in Maycomb.<br/>
This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped and leaned&#160;<br/>
against the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=14></a>“I hope you’ve got it through your head that he’ll kill us each and every one, Dill&#160;<br/>
Harris,” said Jem, when we joined him. “Don’t blame me when he gouges your&#160;<br/>
eyes out. You started it, remember.”<br/>
“You’re still scared,” murmured Dill patiently.<br/>
Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasn’t scared of anything: “It’s&#160;<br/>
just that I can’t think of a way to make him come out without him gettin‘ us.”&#160;<br/>
Besides, Jem had his little sister to think of.<br/>
When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister to think of the&#160;<br/>
time I dared him to jump off the top of the house: “If I got killed, what’d become&#160;<br/>
of you?” he asked. Then he jumped, landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility&#160;<br/>
left him until confronted by the Radley Place.<br/>
“You gonna run out on a dare?” asked Dill. “If you are, then-”<br/>
“Dill, you have to think about these things,” Jem said. “Lemme think a minute…&#160;<br/>
it’s sort of like making a turtle come out…”<br/>
“How’s that?” asked Dill.<br/>
“Strike a match under him.”<br/>
I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him.<br/>
Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful.<br/>
“Ain’t hateful, just persuades him—‘s not like you’d chunk him in the fire,” Jem&#160;<br/>
growled.<br/>
“How do you know a match don’t hurt him?”<br/>
“Turtles can’t feel, stupid,” said Jem.<br/>
“Were you ever a turtle, huh?”<br/>
“My stars, Dill! Now lemme think… reckon we can rock him…”<br/>
Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: “I won’t say you&#160;<br/>
ran out on a dare an‘ I’ll swap you&#160;<i>The Gray Ghost</i>&#160;if you just go up and touch the&#160;<br/>
house.”<br/>
Jem brightened. “Touch the house, that all?”<br/>
Dill nodded.<br/>
“Sure that’s all, now? I don’t want you hollerin‘ something different the minute I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=15></a>get back.”<br/>
“Yeah, that’s all,” said Dill. “He’ll probably come out after you when he sees you&#160;<br/>
in the yard, then Scout’n‘ me’ll jump on him and hold him down till we can tell&#160;<br/>
him we ain’t gonna hurt him.”<br/>
We left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house,&#160;<br/>
and stopped at the gate.<br/>
“Well go on,” said Dill, “Scout and me’s right behind you.”<br/>
“I’m going,” said Jem, “don’t hurry me.”<br/>
He walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the simple terrain as&#160;<br/>
if deciding how best to effect an entry, frowning and scratching his head.<br/>
Then I sneered at him.<br/>
Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped it with his&#160;<br/>
palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray was successful. Dill and&#160;<br/>
I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch, panting and out of breath, we looked&#160;<br/>
back.<br/>
The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down the street we&#160;<br/>
thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny, almost invisible movement,&#160;<br/>
and the house was still.<br/>

<b>Chapter 2</b><br/>
Dill left us early in September, to return to Meridian. We saw him off on the five&#160;<br/>
o’clock bus and I was miserable without him until it occurred to me that I would&#160;<br/>
be starting to school in a week. I never looked forward more to anything in my&#160;<br/>
life. Hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse, looking over at the&#160;<br/>
schoolyard, spying on multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem&#160;<br/>
had given me, learning their games, following Jem’s red jacket through wriggling&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=16></a>circles of blind man’s buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories.&#160;<br/>
I longed to join them.<br/>
Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by one’s&#160;<br/>
parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room&#160;<br/>
was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted&#160;<br/>
around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jem’s&#160;<br/>
pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was&#160;<br/>
careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to&#160;<br/>
approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to&#160;<br/>
embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at&#160;<br/>
recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the&#160;<br/>
fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone.<br/>
“You mean we can’t play any more?” I asked.<br/>
“We’ll do like we always do at home,” he said, “but you’ll see—school’s&#160;<br/>
different.”<br/>
It certainly was. Before the first morning was over, Miss Caroline Fisher, our&#160;<br/>
teacher, hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand&#160;<br/>
with a ruler, then made me stand in the corner until noon.<br/>
Miss Caroline was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn hair, pink&#160;<br/>
cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore high-heeled pumps and&#160;<br/>
a red-and-white-striped dress. She looked and smelled like a peppermint drop.&#160;<br/>
She boarded across the street one door down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinson’s&#160;<br/>
upstairs front room, and when Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a&#160;<br/>
haze for days.<br/>
Miss Caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, “This says I am Miss&#160;<br/>
Caroline Fisher. I am from North Alabama, from Winston County.” The class&#160;<br/>
murmured apprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the&#160;<br/>
peculiarities indigenous to that region. (When Alabama seceded from the Union&#160;<br/>
on January 11, 1861, Winston County seceded from Alabama, and every child in&#160;<br/>
Maycomb County knew it.) North Alabama was full of Liquor Interests, Big&#160;<br/>
Mules, steel companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no&#160;<br/>
background.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>Miss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The cats had long&#160;<br/>
conversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a&#160;<br/>
warm house beneath a kitchen stove. By the time Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for&#160;<br/>
an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of&#160;<br/>
catawba worms. Miss Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted&#160;<br/>
and floursack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs&#160;<br/>
from the time they were able to walk, were immune to imaginative literature.&#160;<br/>
Miss Caroline came to the end of the story and said, “<i>Oh</i>, my, wasn’t that nice?”<br/>
Then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square&#160;<br/>
capitals, turned to the class and asked, “Does anybody know what these are?”<br/>
Everybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year.<br/>
I suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as I read the alphabet a faint&#160;<br/>
line appeared between her eyebrows, and after making me read most of&#160;<i>My First&#160;</i><br/>
<i>Reader</i>&#160;and the stock-market quotations from&#160;<i>The Mobile Register</i>&#160;aloud, she&#160;<br/>
discovered that I was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. Miss&#160;<br/>
Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere&#160;<br/>
with my reading.<br/>
“Teach me?” I said in surprise. “He hasn’t taught me anything, Miss Caroline.&#160;<br/>
Atticus ain’t got time to teach me anything,” I added, when Miss Caroline smiled&#160;<br/>
and shook her head. “Why, he’s so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and&#160;<br/>
reads.”<br/>
“If he didn’t teach you, who did?” Miss Caroline asked good-naturedly.&#160;<br/>
“Somebody did. You weren’t born reading&#160;<i>The Mobile Register</i>.”<br/>
“Jem says I was. He read in a book where I was a Bullfinch instead of a Finch.&#160;<br/>
Jem says my name’s really Jean Louise Bullfinch, that I got swapped when I was&#160;<br/>
born and I’m really a-”<br/>
Miss Caroline apparently thought I was lying. “Let’s not let our imaginations run&#160;<br/>
away with us, dear,” she said. “Now you tell your father not to teach you any&#160;<br/>
more. It’s best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I’ll take over from&#160;<br/>
here and try to undo the damage-”<br/>
“Ma’am?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=18></a>“Your father does not know how to teach. You can have a seat now.”<br/>
I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never&#160;<br/>
deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the&#160;<br/>
daily papers. In the long hours of church—was it then I learned? I could not&#160;<br/>
remember not being able to read hymns. Now that I was compelled to think about&#160;<br/>
it, reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of&#160;<br/>
my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of&#160;<br/>
shoelaces. I could not remember when the lines above Atticus’s moving finger&#160;<br/>
separated into words, but I had stared at them all the evenings in my memory,&#160;<br/>
listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be Enacted into Laws, the diaries of&#160;<br/>
Lorenzo Dow—anything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawled into his&#160;<br/>
lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not&#160;<br/>
love breathing.<br/>
I knew I had annoyed Miss Caroline, so I let well enough alone and stared out the&#160;<br/>
window until recess when Jem cut me from the covey of first-graders in the&#160;<br/>
schoolyard. He asked how I was getting along. I told him.<br/>
“If I didn’t have to stay I’d leave. Jem, that damn lady says Atticus’s been&#160;<br/>
teaching me to read and for him to stop it-”<br/>
“Don’t worry, Scout,” Jem comforted me. “Our teacher says Miss Caroline’s&#160;<br/>
introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college. It’ll be in all&#160;<br/>
the grades soon. You don’t have to learn much out of books that way—it’s like if&#160;<br/>
you wanta learn about cows, you go milk one, see?”<br/>
“Yeah Jem, but I don’t wanta study cows, I-”<br/>
“Sure you do. You hafta know about cows, they’re a big part of life in Maycomb&#160;<br/>
County.”<br/>
I contented myself with asking Jem if he’d lost his mind.<br/>
“I’m just trying to tell you the new way they’re teachin‘ the first grade, stubborn.&#160;<br/>
It’s the Dewey Decimal System.”<br/>
Having never questioned Jem’s pronouncements, I saw no reason to begin now.&#160;<br/>
The Dewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss Caroline waving cards at&#160;<br/>
us on which were printed “the,” “cat,” “rat,” “man,” and “you.” No comment&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=19></a>seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic&#160;<br/>
revelations in silence. I was bored, so I began a letter to Dill. Miss Caroline&#160;<br/>
caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. “Besides,”&#160;<br/>
she said. “We don’t write in the first grade, we print. You won’t learn to write&#160;<br/>
until you’re in the third grade.”<br/>
Calpurnia was to blame for this. It kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days, I&#160;<br/>
guess. She would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the&#160;<br/>
top of a tablet, then copying out a chapter of the Bible beneath. If I reproduced&#160;<br/>
her penmanship satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of&#160;<br/>
bread and butter and sugar. In Calpurnia’s teaching, there was no sentimentality: I&#160;<br/>
seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me.<br/>
“Everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands,” said Miss Caroline,&#160;<br/>
breaking into my new grudge against Calpurnia.<br/>
The town children did so, and she looked us over.<br/>
“Everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk.”<br/>
Molasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced with metallic&#160;<br/>
light. Miss Caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch&#160;<br/>
containers, nodding if the contents pleased her, frowning a little at others. She&#160;<br/>
stopped at Walter Cunningham’s desk. “Where’s yours?” she asked.<br/>
Walter Cunningham’s face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms.&#160;<br/>
His absence of shoes told us how he got them. People caught hookworms going&#160;<br/>
barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows. If Walter had owned any shoes he&#160;<br/>
would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid-<br/>
winter. He did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls.<br/>
“Did you forget your lunch this morning?” asked Miss Caroline.<br/>
Walter looked straight ahead. I saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw.<br/>
“Did you forget it this morning?” asked Miss Caroline. Walter’s jaw twitched&#160;<br/>
again.<br/>
“Yeb’m,” he finally mumbled.<br/>
Miss Caroline went to her desk and opened her purse. “Here’s a quarter,” she said&#160;<br/>
to Walter. “Go and eat downtown today. You can pay me back tomorrow.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a>Walter shook his head. “Nome thank you ma’am,” he drawled softly.<br/>
Impatience crept into Miss Caroline’s voice: “Here Walter, come get it.”<br/>
Walter shook his head again.<br/>
When Walter shook his head a third time someone whispered, “Go on and tell&#160;<br/>
her, Scout.”<br/>
I turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation&#160;<br/>
looking at me. Miss Caroline and I had conferred twice already, and they were&#160;<br/>
looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding.<br/>
I rose graciously on Walter’s behalf: “Ah—Miss Caroline?”<br/>
“What is it, Jean Louise?”<br/>
“Miss Caroline, he’s a Cunningham.”<br/>
I sat back down.<br/>
“What, Jean Louise?”<br/>
I thought I had made things sufficiently clear. It was clear enough to the rest of&#160;<br/>
us: Walter Cunningham was sitting there lying his head off. He didn’t forget his&#160;<br/>
lunch, he didn’t have any. He had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or&#160;<br/>
the next day. He had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time&#160;<br/>
in his life.<br/>
I tried again: “Walter’s one of the Cunninghams, Miss Caroline.”<br/>
“I beg your pardon, Jean Louise?”<br/>
“That’s okay, ma’am, you’ll get to know all the county folks after a while. The&#160;<br/>
Cunninghams never took anything they can’t pay back—no church baskets and no&#160;<br/>
scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what&#160;<br/>
they have. They don’t have much, but they get along on it.”<br/>
My special knowledge of the Cunningham tribe—one branch, that is—was gained&#160;<br/>
from events of last winter. Walter’s father was one of Atticus’s clients. After a&#160;<br/>
dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment, before Mr.&#160;<br/>
Cunningham left he said, “Mr. Finch, I don’t know when I’ll ever be able to pay&#160;<br/>
you.”<br/>
“Let that be the least of your worries, Walter,” Atticus said.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=21></a>When I asked Jem what entailment was, and Jem described it as a condition of&#160;<br/>
having your tail in a crack, I asked Atticus if Mr. Cunningham would ever pay us.<br/>
“Not in money,” Atticus said, “but before the year’s out I’ll have been paid. You&#160;<br/>
watch.”<br/>
We watched. One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the back yard.&#160;<br/>
Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps. With Christmas came a&#160;<br/>
crate of smilax and holly. That spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip&#160;<br/>
greens, Atticus said Mr. Cunningham had more than paid him.<br/>
“Why does he pay you like that?” I asked.<br/>
“Because that’s the only way he can pay me. He has no money.”<br/>
“Are we poor, Atticus?”<br/>
Atticus nodded. “We are indeed.”<br/>
Jem’s nose wrinkled. “Are we as poor as the Cunninghams?”<br/>
“Not exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit them&#160;<br/>
hardest.”<br/>
Atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor. As&#160;<br/>
Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for&#160;<br/>
doctors and dentists and lawyers. Entailment was only a part of Mr.&#160;<br/>
Cunningham’s vexations. The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and&#160;<br/>
the little cash he made went to interest. If he held his mouth right, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Cunningham could get a WPA job, but his land would go to ruin if he left it, and&#160;<br/>
he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased. Mr.&#160;<br/>
Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men.<br/>
As the Cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer, they simply paid us with&#160;<br/>
what they had. “Did you know,” said Atticus, “that Dr. Reynolds works the same&#160;<br/>
way? He charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby. Miss&#160;<br/>
Scout, if you give me your attention I’ll tell you what entailment is. Jem’s&#160;<br/>
definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes.”<br/>
If I could have explained these things to Miss Caroline, I would have saved&#160;<br/>
myself some inconvenience and Miss Caroline subsequent mortification, but it&#160;<br/>
was beyond my ability to explain things as well as Atticus, so I said, “You’re&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=22></a>shamin‘ him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasn’t got a quarter at home to bring you, and&#160;<br/>
you can’t use any stovewood.”<br/>
Miss Caroline stood stock still, then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back&#160;<br/>
to her desk. “Jean Louise, I’ve had about enough of you this morning,” she said.&#160;<br/>
“You’re starting off on the wrong foot in every way, my dear. Hold out your&#160;<br/>
hand.”<br/>
I thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in&#160;<br/>
Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honored method of sealing oral&#160;<br/>
contracts. Wondering what bargain we had made, I turned to the class for an&#160;<br/>
answer, but the class looked back at me in puzzlement. Miss Caroline picked up&#160;<br/>
her ruler, gave me half a dozen quick little pats, then told me to stand in the&#160;<br/>
corner. A storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that&#160;<br/>
Miss Caroline had whipped me.<br/>
When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded&#160;<br/>
again, becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss Blount fell over them.&#160;<br/>
Miss Blount, a native Maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the&#160;<br/>
Decimal System, appeared at the door hands on hips and announced: “If I hear&#160;<br/>
another sound from this room I’ll burn up everybody in it. Miss Caroline, the&#160;<br/>
sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket!”<br/>
My sojourn in the corner was a short one. Saved by the bell, Miss Caroline&#160;<br/>
watched the class file out for lunch. As I was the last to leave, I saw her sink&#160;<br/>
down into her chair and bury her head in her arms. Had her conduct been more&#160;<br/>
friendly toward me, I would have felt sorry for her. She was a pretty little thing.<br/>

<b>Chapter 3</b><br/>
Catching Walter Cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure, but when&#160;<br/>
I was rubbing his nose in the dirt Jem came by and told me to stop. “You’re&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=23></a>bigger’n he is,” he said.<br/>
“He’s as old as you, nearly,” I said. “He made me start off on the wrong foot.”<br/>
“Let him go, Scout. Why?”<br/>
“He didn’t have any lunch,” I said, and explained my involvement in Walter’s&#160;<br/>
dietary affairs.<br/>
Walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to Jem and me.&#160;<br/>
His fists were half cocked, as if expecting an onslaught from both of us. I stomped&#160;<br/>
at him to chase him away, but Jem put out his hand and stopped me. He examined&#160;<br/>
Walter with an air of speculation. “Your daddy Mr. Walter Cunningham from Old&#160;<br/>
Sarum?” he asked, and Walter nodded.<br/>
Walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food: his eyes, as blue as Dill&#160;<br/>
Harris’s, were red-rimmed and watery. There was no color in his face except at&#160;<br/>
the tip of his nose, which was moistly pink. He fingered the straps of his overalls,&#160;<br/>
nervously picking at the metal hooks.<br/>
Jem suddenly grinned at him. “Come on home to dinner with us, Walter,” he said.&#160;<br/>
“We’d be glad to have you.”<br/>
Walter’s face brightened, then darkened.<br/>
Jem said, “Our daddy’s a friend of your daddy’s. Scout here, she’s crazy—she&#160;<br/>
won’t fight you any more.”<br/>
“I wouldn’t be too certain of that,” I said. Jem’s free dispensation of my pledge&#160;<br/>
irked me, but precious noontime minutes were ticking away. “Yeah Walter, I&#160;<br/>
won’t jump on you again. Don’t you like butterbeans? Our Cal’s a real good&#160;<br/>
cook.”<br/>
Walter stood where he was, biting his lip. Jem and I gave up, and we were nearly&#160;<br/>
to the Radley Place when Walter called, “Hey, I’m comin‘!”<br/>
When Walter caught up with us, Jem made pleasant conversation with him. “A&#160;<br/>
hain’t lives there,” he said cordially, pointing to the Radley house. “Ever hear&#160;<br/>
about him, Walter?”<br/>
“Reckon I have,” said Walter. “Almost died first year I come to school and et&#160;<br/>
them pecans—folks say he pizened ‘em and put ’em over on the school side of the&#160;<br/>
fence.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a>Jem seemed to have little fear of Boo Radley now that Walter and I walked beside&#160;<br/>
him. Indeed, Jem grew boastful: “I went all the way up to the house once,” he said&#160;<br/>
to Walter.<br/>
“Anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he&#160;<br/>
passes it,” I said to the clouds above.<br/>
“And who’s runnin‘, Miss Priss?”<br/>
“You are, when ain’t anybody with you.”<br/>
By the time we reached our front steps Walter had forgotten he was a&#160;<br/>
Cunningham. Jem ran to the kitchen and asked Calpurnia to set an extra plate, we&#160;<br/>
had company. Atticus greeted Walter and began a discussion about crops neither&#160;<br/>
Jem nor I could follow.<br/>
“Reason I can’t pass the first grade, Mr. Finch, is I’ve had to stay out ever‘ spring&#160;<br/>
an’ help Papa with the choppin‘, but there’s another’n at the house now that’s&#160;<br/>
field size.”<br/>
“Did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him?” I asked, but Atticus shook his head at&#160;<br/>
me.<br/>
While Walter piled food on his plate, he and Atticus talked together like two men,&#160;<br/>
to the wonderment of Jem and me. Atticus was expounding upon farm problems&#160;<br/>
when Walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house. Atticus&#160;<br/>
summoned Calpurnia, who returned bearing the syrup pitcher. She stood waiting&#160;<br/>
for Walter to help himself. Walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a&#160;<br/>
generous hand. He would probably have poured it into his milk glass had I not&#160;<br/>
asked what the sam hill he was doing.<br/>
The silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher, and he quickly put his&#160;<br/>
hands in his lap. Then he ducked his head.<br/>
Atticus shook his head at me again. “But he’s gone and drowned his dinner in&#160;<br/>
syrup,” I protested. “He’s poured it all over-”<br/>
It was then that Calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen.<br/>
She was furious, and when she was furious Calpurnia’s grammar became erratic.&#160;<br/>
When in tranquility, her grammar was as good as anybody’s in Maycomb. Atticus&#160;<br/>
said Calpurnia had more education than most colored folks.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=25></a>When she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened. “There’s&#160;<br/>
some folks who don’t eat like us,” she whispered fiercely, “but you ain’t called on&#160;<br/>
to contradict ‘em at the table when they don’t. That boy’s yo’ comp’ny and if he&#160;<br/>
wants to eat up the table cloth you let him, you hear?”<br/>
“He ain’t company, Cal, he’s just a Cunningham-”<br/>
“Hush your mouth! Don’t matter who they are, anybody sets foot in this house’s&#160;<br/>
yo‘ comp’ny, and don’t you let me catch you remarkin’ on their ways like you&#160;<br/>
was so high and mighty! Yo‘ folks might be better’n the Cunninghams but it&#160;<br/>
don’t count for nothin’ the way you’re disgracin‘ ’em—if you can’t act fit to eat&#160;<br/>
at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen!”<br/>
Calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging&#160;<br/>
smack. I retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen, thankful, though,&#160;<br/>
that I was spared the humiliation of facing them again. I told Calpurnia to just&#160;<br/>
wait, I’d fix her: one of these days when she wasn’t looking I’d go off and drown&#160;<br/>
myself in Barker’s Eddy and then she’d be sorry. Besides, I added, she’d already&#160;<br/>
gotten me in trouble once today: she had taught me to write and it was all her&#160;<br/>
fault. “Hush your fussin‘,” she said.<br/>
Jem and Walter returned to school ahead of me: staying behind to advise Atticus&#160;<br/>
of Calpurnia’s iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the Radley Place. “She&#160;<br/>
likes Jem better’n she likes me, anyway,” I concluded, and suggested that Atticus&#160;<br/>
lose no time in packing her off.<br/>
“Have you ever considered that Jem doesn’t worry her half as much?” Atticus’s&#160;<br/>
voice was flinty. “I’ve no intention of getting rid of her, now or ever. We couldn’t&#160;<br/>
operate a single day without Cal, have you ever thought of that? You think about&#160;<br/>
how much Cal does for you, and you mind her, you hear?”<br/>
I returned to school and hated Calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered&#160;<br/>
my resentments. I looked up to see Miss Caroline standing in the middle of the&#160;<br/>
room, sheer horror flooding her face. Apparently she had revived enough to&#160;<br/>
persevere in her profession.<br/>
“It’s alive!” she screamed.<br/>
The male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance. Lord, I thought,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=26></a>she’s scared of a mouse. Little Chuck Little, whose patience with all living things&#160;<br/>
was phenomenal, said, “Which way did he go, Miss Caroline? Tell us where he&#160;<br/>
went, quick! D.C.-” he turned to a boy behind him—“D.C., shut the door and&#160;<br/>
we’ll catch him. Quick, ma’am, where’d he go?”<br/>
Miss Caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk, but to a&#160;<br/>
hulking individual unknown to me. Little Chuck’s face contracted and he said&#160;<br/>
gently, “You mean him, ma’am? Yessum, he’s alive. Did he scare you some&#160;<br/>
way?”<br/>
Miss Caroline said desperately, “I was just walking by when it crawled out of his&#160;<br/>
hair… just crawled out of his hair-”<br/>
Little Chuck grinned broadly. “There ain’t no need to fear a cootie, ma’am. Ain’t&#160;<br/>
you ever seen one? Now don’t you be afraid, you just go back to your desk and&#160;<br/>
teach us some more.”<br/>
Little Chuck Little was another member of the population who didn’t know where&#160;<br/>
his next meal was coming from, but he was a born gentleman. He put his hand&#160;<br/>
under her elbow and led Miss Caroline to the front of the room. “Now don’t you&#160;<br/>
fret, ma’am,” he said. “There ain’t no need to fear a cootie. I’ll just fetch you&#160;<br/>
some cool water.” The cootie’s host showed not the faintest interest in the furor&#160;<br/>
he had wrought. He searched the scalp above his forehead, located his guest and&#160;<br/>
pinched it between his thumb and forefinger.<br/>
Miss Caroline watched the process in horrid fascination. Little Chuck brought&#160;<br/>
water in a paper cup, and she drank it gratefully. Finally she found her voice.&#160;<br/>
“What is your name, son?” she asked softly.<br/>
The boy blinked. “Who, me?” Miss Caroline nodded.<br/>
“Burris Ewell.”<br/>
Miss Caroline inspected her roll-book. “I have a Ewell here, but I don’t have a&#160;<br/>
first name… would you spell your first name for me?”<br/>
“Don’t know how. They call me Burris’t home.”<br/>
“Well, Burris,” said Miss Caroline, “I think we’d better excuse you for the rest of&#160;<br/>
the afternoon. I want you to go home and wash your hair.”<br/>
From her desk she produced a thick volume, leafed through its pages and read for&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=27></a>a moment. “A good home remedy for—Burris, I want you to go home and wash&#160;<br/>
your hair with lye soap. When you’ve done that, treat your scalp with kerosene.”<br/>
“What fer, missus?”<br/>
“To get rid of the—er, cooties. You see, Burris, the other children might catch&#160;<br/>
them, and you wouldn’t want that, would you?”<br/>
The boy stood up. He was the filthiest human I had ever seen. His neck was dark&#160;<br/>
gray, the backs of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were black deep into&#160;<br/>
the quick. He peered at Miss Caroline from a fist-sized clean space on his face.&#160;<br/>
No one had noticed him, probably, because Miss Caroline and I had entertained&#160;<br/>
the class most of the morning.<br/>
“And Burris,” said Miss Caroline, “please bathe yourself before you come back&#160;<br/>
tomorrow.”<br/>
The boy laughed rudely. “You ain’t sendin‘ me home, missus. I was on the verge&#160;<br/>
of leavin’—I done done my time for this year.”<br/>
Miss Caroline looked puzzled. “What do you mean by that?”<br/>
The boy did not answer. He gave a short contemptuous snort.<br/>
One of the elderly members of the class answered her: “He’s one of the Ewells,&#160;<br/>
ma’am,” and I wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my&#160;<br/>
attempt. But Miss Caroline seemed willing to listen. “Whole school’s full of ‘em.&#160;<br/>
They come first day every year and then leave. The truant lady gets ’em here&#160;<br/>
‘cause she threatens ’em with the sheriff, but she’s give up tryin‘ to hold ’em. She&#160;<br/>
reckons she’s carried out the law just gettin‘ their names on the roll and runnin’&#160;<br/>
‘em here the first day. You’re supposed to mark ’em absent the rest of the year…”<br/>
“But what about their parents?” asked Miss Caroline, in genuine concern.<br/>
“Ain’t got no mother,” was the answer, “and their paw’s right contentious.”<br/>
Burris Ewell was flattered by the recital. “Been comin‘ to the first day o’ the first&#160;<br/>
grade fer three year now,” he said expansively. “Reckon if I’m smart this year&#160;<br/>
they’ll promote me to the second…”<br/>
Miss Caroline said, “Sit back down, please, Burris,” and the moment she said it I&#160;<br/>
knew she had made a serious mistake. The boy’s condescension flashed to anger.<br/>
“You try and make me, missus.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=28></a>Little Chuck Little got to his feet. “Let him go, ma’am,” he said. “He’s a mean&#160;<br/>
one, a hard-down mean one. He’s liable to start somethin‘, and there’s some little&#160;<br/>
folks here.”<br/>
He was among the most diminutive of men, but when Burris Ewell turned toward&#160;<br/>
him, Little Chuck’s right hand went to his pocket. “Watch your step, Burris,” he&#160;<br/>
said. “I’d soon’s kill you as look at you. Now go home.”<br/>
Burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height, and Miss Caroline took&#160;<br/>
advantage of his indecision: “Burris, go home. If you don’t I’ll call the principal,”&#160;<br/>
she said. “I’ll have to report this, anyway.”<br/>
The boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door.<br/>
Safely out of range, he turned and shouted: “Report and be damned to ye! Ain’t&#160;<br/>
no snot-nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c’n make me do nothin‘! You&#160;<br/>
ain’t makin’ me go nowhere, missus. You just remember that, you ain’t makin‘&#160;<br/>
me go nowhere!”<br/>
He waited until he was sure she was crying, then he shuffled out of the building.<br/>
Soon we were clustered around her desk, trying in our various ways to comfort&#160;<br/>
her. He was a real mean one… below the belt… you ain’t called on to teach folks&#160;<br/>
like that… them ain’t Maycomb’s ways, Miss Caroline, not really… now don’t&#160;<br/>
you fret, ma’am. Miss Caroline, why don’t you read us a story? That cat thing&#160;<br/>
was real fine this mornin‘…<br/>
Miss Caroline smiled, blew her nose, said, “Thank you, darlings,” dispersed us,&#160;<br/>
opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog&#160;<br/>
that lived in a hall.<br/>
When I passed the Radley Place for the fourth time that day—twice at a full gallop<br/>
—my gloom had deepened to match the house. If the remainder of the school year&#160;<br/>
were as fraught with drama as the first day, perhaps it would be mildly&#160;<br/>
entertaining, but the prospect of spending nine months refraining from reading&#160;<br/>
and writing made me think of running away.<br/>
By late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete; when Jem and I&#160;<br/>
raced each other up the sidewalk to meet Atticus coming home from work, I&#160;<br/>
didn’t give him much of a race. It was our habit to run meet Atticus the moment&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=29></a>we saw him round the post office corner in the distance. Atticus seemed to have&#160;<br/>
forgotten my noontime fall from grace; he was full of questions about school. My&#160;<br/>
replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me.<br/>
Perhaps Calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one: she let me watch her&#160;<br/>
fix supper. “Shut your eyes and open your mouth and I’ll give you a surprise,” she&#160;<br/>
said.<br/>
It was not often that she made crackling bread, she said she never had time, but&#160;<br/>
with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her. She knew I loved&#160;<br/>
crackling bread.<br/>
“I missed you today,” she said. “The house got so lonesome ‘long about two&#160;<br/>
o’clock I had to turn on the radio.”<br/>
“Why? Jem’n me ain’t ever in the house unless it’s rainin‘.”<br/>
“I know,” she said, “But one of you’s always in callin‘ distance. I wonder how&#160;<br/>
much of the day I spend just callin’ after you. Well,” she said, getting up from the&#160;<br/>
kitchen chair, “it’s enough time to make a pan of cracklin‘ bread, I reckon. You&#160;<br/>
run along now and let me get supper on the table.”<br/>
Calpurnia bent down and kissed me. I ran along, wondering what had come over&#160;<br/>
her. She had wanted to make up with me, that was it. She had always been too&#160;<br/>
hard on me, she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways, she was sorry and&#160;<br/>
too stubborn to say so. I was weary from the day’s crimes.<br/>
After supper, Atticus sat down with the paper and called, “Scout, ready to read?”&#160;<br/>
The Lord sent me more than I could bear, and I went to the front porch. Atticus&#160;<br/>
followed me.<br/>
“Something wrong, Scout?”<br/>
I told Atticus I didn’t feel very well and didn’t think I’d go to school any more if&#160;<br/>
it was all right with him.<br/>
Atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs. His fingers wandered to his&#160;<br/>
watchpocket; he said that was the only way he could think. He waited in amiable&#160;<br/>
silence, and I sought to reinforce my position: “You never went to school and you&#160;<br/>
do all right, so I’ll just stay home too. You can teach me like Granddaddy taught&#160;<br/>
you ‘n’ Uncle Jack.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=30></a>“No I can’t,” said Atticus. “I have to make a living. Besides, they’d put me in jail&#160;<br/>
if I kept you at home—dose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow.”<br/>
“I’m feeling all right, really.”<br/>
“Thought so. Now what’s the matter?”<br/>
Bit by bit, I told him the day’s misfortunes. “-and she said you taught me all&#160;<br/>
wrong, so we can’t ever read any more, ever. Please don’t send me back, please&#160;<br/>
sir.”<br/>
Atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch. When he completed his&#160;<br/>
examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me.<br/>
“First of all,” he said, “if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you’ll get along a lot&#160;<br/>
better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you&#160;<br/>
consider things from his point of view-”<br/>
“Sir?”<br/>
“-until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”<br/>
Atticus said I had learned many things today, and Miss Caroline had learned&#160;<br/>
several things herself. She had learned not to hand something to a Cunningham,&#160;<br/>
for one thing, but if Walter and I had put ourselves in her shoes we’d have seen it&#160;<br/>
was an honest mistake on her part. We could not expect her to learn all&#160;<br/>
Maycomb’s ways in one day, and we could not hold her responsible when she&#160;<br/>
knew no better.<br/>
“I’ll be dogged,” I said. “I didn’t know no better than not to read to her, and she&#160;<br/>
held me responsible—listen Atticus, I don’t have to go to school!” I was bursting&#160;<br/>
with a sudden thought. “Burris Ewell, remember? He just goes to school the first&#160;<br/>
day. The truant lady reckons she’s carried out the law when she gets his name on&#160;<br/>
the roll-” “You can’t do that, Scout,” Atticus said. “Sometimes it’s better to bend&#160;<br/>
the law a little in special cases. In your case, the law remains rigid. So to school&#160;<br/>
you must go.”<br/>
“I don’t see why I have to when he doesn’t.”<br/>
“Then listen.”<br/>
Atticus said the Ewells had been the disgrace of Maycomb for three generations.&#160;<br/>
None of them had done an honest day’s work in his recollection. He said that&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=31></a>some Christmas, when he was getting rid of the tree, he would take me with him&#160;<br/>
and show me where and how they lived. They were people, but they lived like&#160;<br/>
animals. “They can go to school any time they want to, when they show the&#160;<br/>
faintest symptom of wanting an education,” said Atticus. “There are ways of&#160;<br/>
keeping them in school by force, but it’s silly to force people like the Ewells into&#160;<br/>
a new environment-”<br/>
“If I didn’t go to school tomorrow, you’d force me to.”<br/>
“Let us leave it at this,” said Atticus dryly. “You, Miss Scout Finch, are of the&#160;<br/>
common folk. You must obey the law.” He said that the Ewells were members of&#160;<br/>
an exclusive society made up of Ewells. In certain circumstances the common&#160;<br/>
folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of&#160;<br/>
becoming blind to some of the Ewells’ activities. They didn’t have to go to&#160;<br/>
school, for one thing. Another thing, Mr. Bob Ewell, Burris’s father, was&#160;<br/>
permitted to hunt and trap out of season.<br/>
“Atticus, that’s bad,” I said. In Maycomb County, hunting out of season was a&#160;<br/>
misdemeanor at law, a capital felony in the eyes of the populace.<br/>
“It’s against the law, all right,” said my father, “and it’s certainly bad, but when a&#160;<br/>
man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying&#160;<br/>
from hunger pains. I don’t know of any landowner around here who begrudges&#160;<br/>
those children any game their father can hit.”<br/>
“Mr. Ewell shouldn’t do that-”<br/>
“Of course he shouldn’t, but he’ll never change his ways. Are you going to take&#160;<br/>
out your disapproval on his children?”<br/>
“No sir,” I murmured, and made a final stand: “But if I keep on goin‘ to school,&#160;<br/>
we can’t ever read any more…”<br/>
“That’s really bothering you, isn’t it?”<br/>
“Yes sir.”<br/>
When Atticus looked down at me I saw the expression on his face that always&#160;<br/>
made me expect something. “Do you know what a compromise is?” he asked.<br/>
“Bending the law?”<br/>
“No, an agreement reached by mutual concessions. It works this way,” he said. “If&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=32></a>you’ll concede the necessity of going to school, we’ll go on reading every night&#160;<br/>
just as we always have. Is it a bargain?”<br/>
“Yes sir!”<br/>
“We’ll consider it sealed without the usual formality,” Atticus said, when he saw&#160;<br/>
me preparing to spit.<br/>
As I opened the front screen door Atticus said, “By the way, Scout, you’d better&#160;<br/>
not say anything at school about our agreement.”<br/>
“Why not?”<br/>
“I’m afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by&#160;<br/>
the more learned authorities.”<br/>
Jem and I were accustomed to our father’s last-will-and-testament diction, and we&#160;<br/>
were at all times free to interrupt Atticus for a translation when it was beyond our&#160;<br/>
understanding.<br/>
“Huh, sir?”<br/>
“I never went to school,” he said, “but I have a feeling that if you tell Miss&#160;<br/>
Caroline we read every night she’ll get after me, and I wouldn’t want her after&#160;<br/>
me.”<br/>
Atticus kept us in fits that evening, gravely reading columns of print about a man&#160;<br/>
who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason, which was reason enough for Jem&#160;<br/>
to spend the following Saturday aloft in the treehouse. Jem sat from after&#160;<br/>
breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not Atticus severed&#160;<br/>
his supply lines. I had spent most of the day climbing up and down, running&#160;<br/>
errands for him, providing him with literature, nourishment and water, and was&#160;<br/>
carrying him blankets for the night when Atticus said if I paid no attention to him,&#160;<br/>
Jem would come down. Atticus was right.<br/>

<a name=33></a><b>Chapter 4</b><br/>
The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first. Indeed,&#160;<br/>
they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of&#160;<br/>
construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its&#160;<br/>
well-meaning but fruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics. What Jem called&#160;<br/>
the Dewey Decimal System was school-wide by the end of my first year, so I had&#160;<br/>
no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques. I could only look around&#160;<br/>
me: Atticus and my uncle, who went to school at home, knew everything—at&#160;<br/>
least, what one didn’t know the other did. Furthermore, I couldn’t help noticing&#160;<br/>
that my father had served for years in the state legislature, elected each time&#160;<br/>
without opposition, innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to&#160;<br/>
the development of Good Citizenship. Jem, educated on a half-Decimal half-<br/>
Duncecap basis, seemed to function effectively alone or in a group, but Jem was a&#160;<br/>
poor example: no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from&#160;<br/>
getting at books. As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered from&#160;<i>Time&#160;</i><br/>
<i>magazine</i>&#160;and reading everything I could lay hands on at home, but as I inched&#160;<br/>
sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not&#160;<br/>
help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of&#160;<br/>
what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom&#160;<br/>
was exactly what the state had in mind for me.<br/>
As the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem, who had to&#160;<br/>
stay until three o’clock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast as I could, not stopping&#160;<br/>
until I reached the safety of our front porch. One afternoon as I raced by,&#160;<br/>
something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that I took a deep breath, a&#160;<br/>
long look around, and went back.<br/>
Two live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots reached out into the&#160;<br/>
side-road and made it bumpy. Something about one of the trees attracted my&#160;<br/>
attention.<br/>
Some tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level, winking at me in&#160;<br/>
the afternoon sun. I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached&#160;<br/>
into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer&#160;<br/>
wrappers.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=34></a>My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I&#160;<br/>
remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot.&#160;<br/>
The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited&#160;<br/>
for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigley’s Double-<br/>
Mint.<br/>
When Jem came home he asked me where I got such a wad. I told him I found it.<br/>
“Don’t eat things you find, Scout.”<br/>
“This wasn’t on the ground, it was in a tree.”<br/>
Jem growled.<br/>
“Well it was,” I said. “It was sticking in that tree yonder, the one comin‘ from&#160;<br/>
school.”<br/>
“Spit it out right now!”<br/>
I spat it out. The tang was fading, anyway. “I’ve been chewin‘ it all afternoon and&#160;<br/>
I ain’t dead yet, not even sick.”<br/>
Jem stamped his foot. “Don’t you know you’re not supposed to even touch the&#160;<br/>
trees over there? You’ll get killed if you do!”<br/>
“You touched the house once!”<br/>
“That was different! You go gargle—right now, you hear me?”<br/>
“Ain’t neither, it’ll take the taste outa my mouth.”<br/>
“You don’t ‘n’ I’ll tell Calpurnia on you!”<br/>
Rather than risk a tangle with Calpurnia, I did as Jem told me. For some reason,&#160;<br/>
my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship:&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia’s tyranny, unfairness, and meddling in my business had faded to gentle&#160;<br/>
grumblings of general disapproval. On my part, I went to much trouble,&#160;<br/>
sometimes, not to provoke her.<br/>
Summer was on the way; Jem and I awaited it with impatience. Summer was our&#160;<br/>
best season: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots, or trying to sleep&#160;<br/>
in the treehouse; summer was everything good to eat; it was a thousand colors in a&#160;<br/>
parched landscape; but most of all, summer was Dill.<br/>
The authorities released us early the last day of school, and Jem and I walked&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=35></a>home together. “Reckon old Dill’ll be coming home tomorrow,” I said.<br/>
“Probably day after,” said Jem. “Mis’sippi turns ‘em loose a day later.”<br/>
As we came to the live oaks at the Radley Place I raised my finger to point for the&#160;<br/>
hundredth time to the knot-hole where I had found the chewing gum, trying to&#160;<br/>
make Jem believe I had found it there, and found myself pointing at another piece&#160;<br/>
of tinfoil.<br/>
“I see it, Scout! I see it-”<br/>
Jem looked around, reached up, and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package. We&#160;<br/>
ran home, and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits&#160;<br/>
of tinfoil collected from chewing-gum wrappers. It was the kind of box wedding&#160;<br/>
rings came in, purple velvet with a minute catch. Jem flicked open the tiny catch.&#160;<br/>
Inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies, one on top of the other. Jem&#160;<br/>
examined them.<br/>
“Indian-heads,” he said. “Nineteen-six and Scout, one of em’s nineteen-hundred.&#160;<br/>
These are real old.”<br/>
“Nineteen-hundred,” I echoed. “Say-”<br/>
“Hush a minute, I’m thinkin‘.”<br/>
“Jem, you reckon that’s somebody’s hidin‘ place?”<br/>
“Naw, don’t anybody much but us pass by there, unless it’s some grown&#160;<br/>
person’s-”<br/>
“Grown folks don’t have hidin‘ places. You reckon we ought to keep ’em, Jem?”<br/>
“I don’t know what we could do, Scout. Who’d we give ‘em back to? I know for a&#160;<br/>
fact don’t anybody go by there—Cecil goes by the back street an’ all the way&#160;<br/>
around by town to get home.”<br/>
Cecil Jacobs, who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office,&#160;<br/>
walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the Radley Place and old Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Henry Lafayette Dubose. Mrs. Dubose lived two doors up the street from us;&#160;<br/>
neighborhood opinion was unanimous that Mrs. Dubose was the meanest old&#160;<br/>
woman who ever lived. Jem wouldn’t go by her place without Atticus beside him.<br/>
“What you reckon we oughta do, Jem?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=36></a>Finders were keepers unless title was proven. Plucking an occasional camellia,&#160;<br/>
getting a squirt of hot milk from Miss Maudie Atkinson’s cow on a summer day,&#160;<br/>
helping ourselves to someone’s scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture, but&#160;<br/>
money was different.<br/>
“Tell you what,” said Jem. “We’ll keep ‘em till school starts, then go around and&#160;<br/>
ask everybody if they’re theirs. They’re some bus child’s, maybe—he was too&#160;<br/>
taken up with gettin’ outa school today an‘ forgot ’em. These are somebody’s, I&#160;<br/>
know that. See how they’ve been slicked up? They’ve been saved.”<br/>
“Yeah, but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that? You&#160;<br/>
know it doesn’t last.”<br/>
“I don’t know, Scout. But these are important to somebody…”<br/>
“How’s that, Jem…?”<br/>
“Well, Indian-heads—well, they come from the Indians. They’re real strong&#160;<br/>
magic, they make you have good luck. Not like fried chicken when you’re not&#160;<br/>
lookin‘ for it, but things like long life ’n‘ good health, ’n‘ passin’ six-weeks&#160;<br/>
tests… these are real valuable to somebody. I’m gonna put em in my trunk.”<br/>
Before Jem went to his room, he looked for a long time at the Radley Place. He&#160;<br/>
seemed to be thinking again.<br/>
Two days later Dill arrived in a blaze of glory: he had ridden the train by himself&#160;<br/>
from Meridian to Maycomb Junction (a courtesy title—Maycomb Junction was in&#160;<br/>
Abbott County) where he had been met by Miss Rachel in Maycomb’s one taxi;&#160;<br/>
he had eaten dinner in the diner, he had seen two twins hitched together get off&#160;<br/>
the train in Bay St. Louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats. He had&#160;<br/>
discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore&#160;<br/>
real short pants with a belt; he was somewhat heavier, no taller, and said he had&#160;<br/>
seen his father. Dill’s father was taller than ours, he had a black beard (pointed),&#160;<br/>
and was president of the L &amp; N Railroad.<br/>
“I helped the engineer for a while,” said Dill, yawning.<br/>
“In a pig’s ear you did, Dill. Hush,” said Jem. “What’ll we play today?”<br/>
“Tom and Sam and Dick,” said Dill. “Let’s go in the front yard.” Dill wanted the&#160;<br/>
Rover Boys because there were three respectable parts. He was clearly tired of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=37></a>being our character man.<br/>
“I’m tired of those,” I said. I was tired of playing Tom Rover, who suddenly lost&#160;<br/>
his memory in the middle of a picture show and was out of the script until the&#160;<br/>
end, when he was found in Alaska.<br/>
“Make us up one, Jem,” I said.<br/>
“I’m tired of makin‘ ’em up.”<br/>
Our first days of freedom, and we were tired. I wondered what the summer would&#160;<br/>
bring.<br/>
We had strolled to the front yard, where Dill stood looking down the street at the&#160;<br/>
dreary face of the Radley Place. “I—smell—death,” he said. “I do, I mean it,” he&#160;<br/>
said, when I told him to shut up.<br/>
“You mean when somebody’s dyin‘ you can smell it?”<br/>
“No, I mean I can smell somebody an‘ tell if they’re gonna die. An old lady&#160;<br/>
taught me how.” Dill leaned over and sniffed me. “Jean—Louise—Finch, you are&#160;<br/>
going to die in three days.”<br/>
“Dill if you don’t hush I’ll knock you bowlegged. I mean it, now-”<br/>
“Yawl hush,” growled Jem, “you act like you believe in Hot Steams.”<br/>
“You act like you don’t,” I said.<br/>
“What’s a Hot Steam?” asked Dill.<br/>
“Haven’t you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot&#160;<br/>
place?” Jem asked Dill. “A Hot Steam’s somebody who can’t get to heaven, just&#160;<br/>
wallows around on lonesome roads an‘ if you walk through him, when you die&#160;<br/>
you’ll be one too, an’ you’ll go around at night suckin‘ people’s breath-”<br/>
“How can you keep from passing through one?”<br/>
“You can’t,” said Jem. “Sometimes they stretch all the way across the road, but if&#160;<br/>
you hafta go through one you say, ‘Angel-bright, life-in-death; get off the road,&#160;<br/>
don’t suck my breath.’ That keeps ‘em from wrapping around you-”<br/>
“Don’t you believe a word he says, Dill,” I said. “Calpurnia says that’s nigger-<br/>
talk.”<br/>
Jem scowled darkly at me, but said, “Well, are we gonna play anything or not?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=38></a>“Let’s roll in the tire,” I suggested.<br/>
Jem sighed. “You know I’m too big.”<br/>
“You c’n push.”<br/>
I ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house. I slapped it&#160;<br/>
up to the front yard. “I’m first,” I said.<br/>
Dill said he ought to be first, he just got here.<br/>
Jem arbitrated, awarded me first push with an extra time for Dill, and I folded&#160;<br/>
myself inside the tire.<br/>
Until it happened I did not realize that Jem was offended by my contradicting him&#160;<br/>
on Hot Steams, and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me.&#160;<br/>
He did, by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body.&#160;<br/>
Ground, sky and houses melted into a mad palette, my ears throbbed, I was&#160;<br/>
suffocating. I could not put out my hands to stop, they were wedged between my&#160;<br/>
chest and knees. I could only hope that Jem would outrun the tire and me, or that I&#160;<br/>
would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk. I heard him behind me, chasing and&#160;<br/>
shouting.<br/>
The tire bumped on gravel, skeetered across the road, crashed into a barrier and&#160;<br/>
popped me like a cork onto pavement. Dizzy and nauseated, I lay on the cement&#160;<br/>
and shook my head still, pounded my ears to silence, and heard Jem’s voice:&#160;<br/>
“Scout, get away from there, come on!”<br/>
I raised my head and stared at the Radley Place steps in front of me. I froze.<br/>
“Come on, Scout, don’t just lie there!” Jem was screaming. “Get up, can’tcha?”<br/>
I got to my feet, trembling as I thawed.<br/>
“Get the tire!” Jem hollered. “Bring it with you! Ain’t you got any sense at all?”<br/>
When I was able to navigate, I ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees&#160;<br/>
would carry me.<br/>
“Why didn’t you bring it?” Jem yelled.<br/>
“Why don’t&#160;<i>you</i>&#160;get it?” I screamed.<br/>
Jem was silent.<br/>
“Go on, it ain’t far inside the gate. Why, you even touched the house once,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=39></a>remember?”<br/>
Jem looked at me furiously, could not decline, ran down the sidewalk, treaded&#160;<br/>
water at the gate, then dashed in and retrieved the tire.<br/>
“See there?” Jem was scowling triumphantly. “Nothin‘ to it. I swear, Scout,&#160;<br/>
sometimes you act so much like a girl it’s mortifyin’.”<br/>
There was more to it than he knew, but I decided not to tell him.<br/>
Calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled, “Lemonade time! You all get in&#160;<br/>
outa that hot sun ‘fore you fry alive!” Lemonade in the middle of the morning was&#160;<br/>
a summertime ritual. Calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch, then&#160;<br/>
went about her business. Being out of Jem’s good graces did not worry me&#160;<br/>
especially. Lemonade would restore his good humor.<br/>
Jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest. “I know what we are&#160;<br/>
going to play,” he announced. “Something new, something different.”<br/>
“What?” asked Dill.<br/>
“Boo Radley.”<br/>
Jem’s head at times was transparent: he had thought that up to make me&#160;<br/>
understand he wasn’t afraid of Radleys in any shape or form, to contrast his own&#160;<br/>
fearless heroism with my cowardice.<br/>
“Boo Radley? How?” asked Dill.<br/>
Jem said, “Scout, you can be Mrs. Radley-”<br/>
“I declare if I will. I don’t think-”<br/>
“‘Smatter?” said Dill. “Still scared?”<br/>
“He can get out at night when we’re all asleep…” I said.<br/>
Jem hissed. “Scout, how’s he gonna know what we’re doin‘? Besides, I don’t&#160;<br/>
think he’s still there. He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney.”<br/>
Dill said, “Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she’s scared.”<br/>
I was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn’t prove it, and&#160;<br/>
felt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot&#160;<br/>
Steams, phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.<br/>
Jem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do was come out&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=40></a>and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the&#160;<br/>
sidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went&#160;<br/>
under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time.<br/>
As the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, added&#160;<br/>
dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang&#160;<br/>
changes every day.<br/>
Dill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and&#160;<br/>
appear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worst&#160;<br/>
performance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted&#160;<br/>
ladies who entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I&#160;<br/>
played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that&#160;<br/>
Boo Radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in&#160;<br/>
the daytime and Atticus home at night.<br/>
Jem was a born hero.<br/>
It was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and&#160;<br/>
neighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr.&#160;<br/>
Radley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her&#160;<br/>
right forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldn’t find&#160;<br/>
any cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the&#160;<br/>
time, while Boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house.<br/>
The three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for a&#160;<br/>
change; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with&#160;<br/>
the brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff,&#160;<br/>
assorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the&#160;<br/>
Radleys than anybody in Maycomb.<br/>
When it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal&#160;<br/>
the scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnia’s back was turned,&#160;<br/>
then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem,&#160;<br/>
and Jem would fake a plunge into Dill’s thigh. From where I stood it looked real.<br/>
When Mr. Nathan Radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still&#160;<br/>
and silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he&#160;<br/>
suspected. Our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared, and once I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=41></a>saw Miss Maudie Atkinson staring across the street at us, her hedge clippers&#160;<br/>
poised in midair.<br/>
One day we were so busily playing Chapter XXV, Book II of One Man’s Family,&#160;<br/>
we did not see Atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us, slapping a rolled&#160;<br/>
magazine against his knee. The sun said twelve noon.<br/>
“What are you all playing?” he asked.<br/>
“Nothing,” said Jem.<br/>
Jem’s evasion told me our game was a secret, so I kept quiet.<br/>
“What are you doing with those scissors, then? Why are you tearing up that&#160;<br/>
newspaper? If it’s today’s I’ll tan you.”<br/>
“Nothing.”<br/>
“Nothing what?” said Atticus.<br/>
“Nothing, sir.”<br/>
“Give me those scissors,” Atticus said. “They’re no things to play with. Does this&#160;<br/>
by any chance have anything to do with the Radleys?”<br/>
“No sir,” said Jem, reddening.<br/>
“I hope it doesn’t,” he said shortly, and went inside the house.<br/>
“Je-m…”<br/>
“Shut up! He’s gone in the livingroom, he can hear us in there.”<br/>
Safely in the yard, Dill asked Jem if we could play any more.<br/>
“I don’t know. Atticus didn’t say we couldn’t-”<br/>
“Jem,” I said, “I think Atticus knows it anyway.”<br/>
“No he don’t. If he did he’d say he did.”<br/>
I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined&#160;<br/>
things, that’s why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I&#160;<br/>
could just go off and find some to play with.<br/>
“All right, you just keep it up then,” I said. “You’ll find out.”<br/>
Atticus’s arrival was the second reason I wanted to quit the game. The first reason&#160;<br/>
happened the day I rolled into the Radley front yard. Through all the head-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=42></a>shaking, quelling of nausea and Jem-yelling, I had heard another sound, so low I&#160;<br/>
could not have heard it from the sidewalk. Someone inside the house was&#160;<br/>
laughing.<br/>
<a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#1">Contents&#160;-&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#32">Prev&#160;/&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#51">Next</a><br/>
<b>Chapter 5</b><br/>
My nagging got the better of Jem eventually, as I knew it would, and to my relief&#160;<br/>
we slowed down the game for a while. He still maintained, however, that Atticus&#160;<br/>
hadn’t said we couldn’t, therefore we could; and if Atticus ever said we couldn’t,&#160;<br/>
Jem had thought of a way around it: he would simply change the names of the&#160;<br/>
characters and then we couldn’t be accused of playing anything.<br/>
Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was becoming&#160;<br/>
something of a trial anyway, following Jem about. He had asked me earlier in the&#160;<br/>
summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked&#160;<br/>
as his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me.&#160;<br/>
I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent&#160;<br/>
days together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they&#160;<br/>
needed a third party. But I kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a&#160;<br/>
while, and on pain of being called a girl, I spent most of the remaining twilights&#160;<br/>
that summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch.<br/>
Jem and I had always enjoyed the free run of Miss Maudie’s yard if we kept out&#160;<br/>
of her azaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. Until Jem and&#160;<br/>
Dill excluded me from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood,&#160;<br/>
but a relatively benign presence.<br/>
Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat her&#160;<br/>
scuppernongs if we didn’t jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms&#160;<br/>
so generous we seldom spoke to her, so careful were we to preserve the delicate&#160;<br/>
balance of our relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=43></a>behavior.<br/>
Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted. She was a&#160;<br/>
widow, a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and&#160;<br/>
men’s coveralls, but after her five o’clock bath she would appear on the porch and&#160;<br/>
reign over the street in magisterial beauty.<br/>
She loved everything that grew in God’s earth, even the weeds. With one&#160;<br/>
exception. If she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the Second&#160;<br/>
Battle of the Marne: she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to&#160;<br/>
blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful it’d kill&#160;<br/>
us all if we didn’t stand out of the way.<br/>
“Why can’t you just pull it up?” I asked, after witnessing a prolonged campaign&#160;<br/>
against a blade not three inches high.<br/>
“Pull it up, child, pull it up?” She picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her&#160;<br/>
thumb up its tiny stalk. Microscopic grains oozed out. “Why, one sprig of nut&#160;<br/>
grass can ruin a whole yard. Look here. When it comes fall this dries up and the&#160;<br/>
wind blows it all over Maycomb County!” Miss Maudie’s face likened such an&#160;<br/>
occurrence unto an Old Testament pestilence.<br/>
Her speech was crisp for a Maycomb County inhabitant. She called us by all our&#160;<br/>
names, and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her&#160;<br/>
eyeteeth. When I admired them and hoped I would have some eventually, she&#160;<br/>
said, “Look here.” With a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework, a&#160;<br/>
gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship.<br/>
Miss Maudie’s benevolence extended to Jem and Dill, whenever they paused in&#160;<br/>
their pursuits: we reaped the benefits of a talent Miss Maudie had hitherto kept&#160;<br/>
hidden from us. She made the best cakes in the neighborhood. When she was&#160;<br/>
admitted into our confidence, every time she baked she made a big cake and three&#160;<br/>
little ones, and she would call across the street: “Jem Finch, Scout Finch, Charles&#160;<br/>
Baker Harris, come here!” Our promptness was always rewarded.<br/>
In summertime, twilights are long and peaceful. Often as not, Miss Maudie and I&#160;<br/>
would sit silently on her porch, watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the&#160;<br/>
sun went down, watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and&#160;<br/>
disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=44></a>“Miss Maudie,” I said one evening, “do you think Boo Radley’s still alive?”<br/>
“His name’s Arthur and he’s alive,” she said. She was rocking slowly in her big&#160;<br/>
oak chair. “Do you smell my mimosa? It’s like angels’ breath this evening.”<br/>
“Yessum. How do you know?”<br/>
“Know what, child?”<br/>
“That B—Mr. Arthur’s still alive?”<br/>
“What a morbid question. But I suppose it’s a morbid subject. I know he’s alive,&#160;<br/>
Jean Louise, because I haven’t seen him carried out yet.”<br/>
“Maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney.”<br/>
“Where did you get such a notion?”<br/>
“That’s what Jem said he thought they did.”<br/>
“S-ss-ss. He gets more like Jack Finch every day.”<br/>
Miss Maudie had known Uncle Jack Finch, Atticus’s brother, since they were&#160;<br/>
children. Nearly the same age, they had grown up together at Finch’s Landing.&#160;<br/>
Miss Maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner, Dr. Frank Buford. Dr.&#160;<br/>
Buford’s profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in&#160;<br/>
the ground, so he stayed poor. Uncle Jack Finch confined his passion for digging&#160;<br/>
to his window boxes in Nashville and stayed rich. We saw Uncle Jack every&#160;<br/>
Christmas, and every Christmas he yelled across the street for Miss Maudie to&#160;<br/>
come marry him. Miss Maudie would yell back, “Call a little louder, Jack Finch,&#160;<br/>
and they’ll hear you at the post office, I haven’t heard you yet!” Jem and I thought&#160;<br/>
this a strange way to ask for a lady’s hand in marriage, but then Uncle Jack was&#160;<br/>
rather strange. He said he was trying to get Miss Maudie’s goat, that he had been&#160;<br/>
trying unsuccessfully for forty years, that he was the last person in the world Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing,&#160;<br/>
and the best defense to her was spirited offense, all of which we understood&#160;<br/>
clearly.<br/>
“Arthur Radley just stays in the house, that’s all,” said Miss Maudie. “Wouldn’t&#160;<br/>
you stay in the house if you didn’t want to come out?”<br/>
“Yessum, but I’d wanta come out. Why doesn’t he?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=45></a>Miss Maudie’s eyes narrowed. “You know that story as well as I do.”<br/>
“I never heard why, though. Nobody ever told me why.”<br/>
Miss Maudie settled her bridgework. “You know old Mr. Radley was a foot-<br/>
washing Baptist-”<br/>
“That’s what you are, ain’t it?”<br/>
“My shell’s not that hard, child. I’m just a Baptist.”<br/>
“Don’t you all believe in foot-washing?”<br/>
“We do. At home in the bathtub.”<br/>
“But we can’t have communion with you all-”<br/>
Apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed&#160;<br/>
communion, Miss Maudie said: “Foot-washers believe anything that’s pleasure is&#160;<br/>
a sin. Did you know some of ‘em came out of the woods one Saturday and passed&#160;<br/>
by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell?”<br/>
“Your flowers, too?”<br/>
“Yes ma’am. They’d burn right with me. They thought I spent too much time in&#160;<br/>
God’s outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the Bible.”<br/>
My confidence in pulpit Gospel lessened at the vision of Miss Maudie stewing&#160;<br/>
forever in various Protestant hells. True enough, she had an acid tongue in her&#160;<br/>
head, and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good, as did Miss&#160;<br/>
Stephanie Crawford. But while no one with a grain of sense trusted Miss&#160;<br/>
Stephanie, Jem and I had considerable faith in Miss Maudie. She had never told&#160;<br/>
on us, had never played cat-and-mouse with us, she was not at all interested in our&#160;<br/>
private lives. She was our friend. How so reasonable a creature could live in peril&#160;<br/>
of everlasting torment was incomprehensible.<br/>
“That ain’t right, Miss Maudie. You’re the best lady I know.”<br/>
Miss Maudie grinned. “Thank you ma’am. Thing is, foot-washers think women&#160;<br/>
are a sin by definition. They take the Bible literally, you know.”<br/>
“Is that why Mr. Arthur stays in the house, to keep away from women?”<br/>
“I’ve no idea.”<br/>
“It doesn’t make sense to me. Looks like if Mr. Arthur was hankerin‘ after heaven&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=46></a>he’d come out on the porch at least. Atticus says God’s loving folks like you love&#160;<br/>
yourself-”<br/>
Miss Maudie stopped rocking, and her voice hardened. “You are too young to&#160;<br/>
understand it,” she said, “but sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse&#160;<br/>
than a whiskey bottle in the hand of—oh, of your father.”<br/>
I was shocked. “Atticus doesn’t drink whiskey,” I said. “He never drunk a drop in&#160;<br/>
his life—nome, yes he did. He said he drank some one time and didn’t like it.”<br/>
Miss Maudie laughed. “Wasn’t talking about your father,” she said. “What I&#160;<br/>
meant was, if Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn’t be as hard as&#160;<br/>
some men are at their best. There are just some kind of men who—who’re so&#160;<br/>
busy worrying about the next world they’ve never learned to live in this one, and&#160;<br/>
you can look down the street and see the results.”<br/>
“Do you think they’re true, all those things they say about B—Mr. Arthur?”<br/>
“What things?”<br/>
I told her.<br/>
“That is three-fourths colored folks and one-fourth Stephanie Crawford,” said&#160;<br/>
Miss Maudie grimly. “Stephanie Crawford even told me once she woke up in the&#160;<br/>
middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her. I said what did&#160;<br/>
you do, Stephanie, move over in the bed and make room for him? That shut her&#160;<br/>
up a while.”<br/>
I was sure it did. Miss Maudie’s voice was enough to shut anybody up.<br/>
“No, child,” she said, “that is a sad house. I remember Arthur Radley when he&#160;<br/>
was a boy. He always spoke nicely to me, no matter what folks said he did. Spoke&#160;<br/>
as nicely as he knew how.”<br/>
“You reckon he’s crazy?”<br/>
Miss Maudie shook her head. “If he’s not he should be by now. The things that&#160;<br/>
happen to people we never really know. What happens in houses behind closed&#160;<br/>
doors, what secrets-”<br/>
“Atticus don’t ever do anything to Jem and me in the house that he don’t do in the&#160;<br/>
yard,” I said, feeling it my duty to defend my parent.<br/>
“Gracious child, I was raveling a thread, wasn’t even thinking about your father,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=47></a>but now that I am I’ll say this: Atticus Finch is the same in his house as he is on&#160;<br/>
the public streets. How’d you like some fresh poundcake to take home?”<br/>
I liked it very much.<br/>
Next morning when I awakened I found Jem and Dill in the back yard deep in&#160;<br/>
conversation. When I joined them, as usual they said go away.<br/>
“Will not. This yard’s as much mine as it is yours, Jem Finch. I got just as much&#160;<br/>
right to play in it as you have.”<br/>
Dill and Jem emerged from a brief huddle: “If you stay you’ve got to do what we&#160;<br/>
tell you,” Dill warned.<br/>
“We-ll,” I said, “who’s so high and mighty all of a sudden?”<br/>
“If you don’t say you’ll do what we tell you, we ain’t gonna tell you anything,”&#160;<br/>
Dill continued.<br/>
“You act like you grew ten inches in the night! All right, what is it?”<br/>
Jem said placidly, “We are going to give a note to Boo Radley.”<br/>
“Just how?” I was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me. It was all&#160;<br/>
right for Miss Maudie to talk—she was old and snug on her porch. It was&#160;<br/>
different for us.<br/>
Jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it&#160;<br/>
through the shutters. If anyone came along, Dill would ring the bell.<br/>
Dill raised his right hand. In it was my mother’s silver dinner-bell.<br/>
“I’m goin‘ around to the side of the house,” said Jem. “We looked yesterday from&#160;<br/>
across the street, and there’s a shutter loose. Think maybe I can make it stick on&#160;<br/>
the window sill, at least.”<br/>
“Jem-”<br/>
“Now you’re in it and you can’t get out of it, you’ll just stay in it, Miss Priss!”<br/>
“Okay, okay, but I don’t wanta watch. Jem, somebody was-”<br/>
“Yes you will, you’ll watch the back end of the lot and Dill’s gonna watch the&#160;<br/>
front of the house an‘ up the street, an’ if anybody comes he’ll ring the bell. That&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=48></a>clear?”<br/>
“All right then. What’d you write him?”<br/>
Dill said, “We’re askin‘ him real politely to come out sometimes, and tell us what&#160;<br/>
he does in there—we said we wouldn’t hurt him and we’d buy him an ice cream.”<br/>
“You all’ve gone crazy, he’ll kill us!”<br/>
Dill said, “It’s my idea. I figure if he’d come out and sit a spell with us he might&#160;<br/>
feel better.”<br/>
“How do you know he don’t feel good?”<br/>
“Well how’d you feel if you’d been shut up for a hundred years with nothin‘ but&#160;<br/>
cats to eat? I bet he’s got a beard down to here-” “Like your daddy’s?”<br/>
“He ain’t got a beard, he-” Dill stopped, as if trying to remember.<br/>
“Uh huh, caughtcha,” I said. “You said ‘fore you were off the train good your&#160;<br/>
daddy had a black beard-”<br/>
“If it’s all the same to you he shaved it off last summer! Yeah, an‘ I’ve got the&#160;<br/>
letter to prove it—he sent me two dollars, too!”<br/>
“Keep on—I reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform! That’n never&#160;<br/>
showed up, did it? You just keep on tellin‘ ’em, son-”<br/>
Dill Harris could tell the biggest ones I ever heard. Among other things, he had&#160;<br/>
been up in a mail plane seventeen times, he had been to Nova Scotia, he had seen&#160;<br/>
an elephant, and his granddaddy was Brigadier General Joe Wheeler and left him&#160;<br/>
his sword.<br/>
“You all hush,” said Jem. He scuttled beneath the house and came out with a&#160;<br/>
yellow bamboo pole. “Reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk?”<br/>
“Anybody who’s brave enough to go up and touch the house hadn’t oughta use a&#160;<br/>
fishin‘ pole,” I said. “Why don’t you just knock the front door down?”<br/>
“This—is—different,” said Jem, “how many times do I have to tell you that?”<br/>
Dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to Jem. The three of us&#160;<br/>
walked cautiously toward the old house. Dill remained at the light-pole on the&#160;<br/>
front corner of the lot, and Jem and I edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side&#160;<br/>
of the house. I walked beyond Jem and stood where I could see around the curve.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=49></a>“All clear,” I said. “Not a soul in sight.”<br/>
Jem looked up the sidewalk to Dill, who nodded.<br/>
Jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole, let the pole out across the&#160;<br/>
yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected. The pole lacked several&#160;<br/>
inches of being long enough, and Jem leaned over as far as he could. I watched&#160;<br/>
him making jabbing motions for so long, I abandoned my post and went to him.<br/>
“Can’t get it off the pole,” he muttered, “or if I got it off I can’t make it stay. G’on&#160;<br/>
back down the street, Scout.”<br/>
I returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road. Occasionally I looked&#160;<br/>
back at Jem, who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill. It&#160;<br/>
would flutter to the ground and Jem would jab it up, until I thought if Boo Radley&#160;<br/>
ever received it he wouldn’t be able to read it. I was looking down the street when&#160;<br/>
the dinner-bell rang.<br/>
Shoulder up, I reeled around to face Boo Radley and his bloody fangs; instead, I&#160;<br/>
saw Dill ringing the bell with all his might in Atticus’s face.<br/>
Jem looked so awful I didn’t have the heart to tell him I told him so. He trudged&#160;<br/>
along, dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk.<br/>
Atticus said, “Stop ringing that bell.”<br/>
Dill grabbed the clapper; in the silence that followed, I wished he’d start ringing it&#160;<br/>
again. Atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips.&#160;<br/>
“Jem,” he said, “what were you doing?”<br/>
“Nothin‘, sir.”<br/>
“I don’t want any of that. Tell me.”<br/>
“I was—we were just tryin‘ to give somethin’ to Mr. Radley.”<br/>
“What were you trying to give him?”<br/>
“Just a letter.”<br/>
“Let me see it.”<br/>
Jem held out a filthy piece of paper. Atticus took it and tried to read it. “Why do&#160;<br/>
you want Mr. Radley to come out?”<br/>
Dill said, “We thought he might enjoy us…” and dried up when Atticus looked at&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=50></a>him.<br/>
“Son,” he said to Jem, “I’m going to tell you something and tell you one time:&#160;<br/>
stop tormenting that man. That goes for the other two of you.”<br/>
What Mr. Radley did was his own business. If he wanted to come out, he would.&#160;<br/>
If he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from&#160;<br/>
the attentions of inquisitive children, which was a mild term for the likes of us.&#160;<br/>
How would we like it if Atticus barged in on us without knocking, when we were&#160;<br/>
in our rooms at night? We were, in effect, doing the same thing to Mr. Radley.&#160;<br/>
What Mr. Radley did might seem peculiar to us, but it did not seem peculiar to&#160;<br/>
him. Furthermore, had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate&#160;<br/>
with another being was by the front door instead of a side window? Lastly, we&#160;<br/>
were to stay away from that house until we were invited there, we were not to&#160;<br/>
play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street&#160;<br/>
or in this town-<br/>
“We weren’t makin‘ fun of him, we weren’t laughin’ at him,” said Jem, “we were&#160;<br/>
just-”<br/>
“So that was what you were doing, wasn’t it?”<br/>
“Makin‘ fun of him?”<br/>
“No,” said Atticus, “putting his life’s history on display for the edification of the&#160;<br/>
neighborhood.”<br/>
Jem seemed to swell a little. “I didn’t say we were doin‘ that, I didn’t say it!”<br/>
Atticus grinned dryly. “You just told me,” he said. “You stop this nonsense right&#160;<br/>
now, every one of you.”<br/>
Jem gaped at him.<br/>
“You want to be a lawyer, don’t you?” Our father’s mouth was suspiciously firm,&#160;<br/>
as if he were trying to hold it in line.<br/>
Jem decided there was no point in quibbling, and was silent. When Atticus went&#160;<br/>
inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning,&#160;<br/>
Jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyer’s trick on&#160;<br/>
record. He waited a respectful distance from the front steps, watched Atticus&#160;<br/>
leave the house and walk toward town. When Atticus was out of earshot Jem&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=51></a>yelled after him: “I thought I wanted to be a lawyer but I ain’t so sure now!”<br/>

<b>Chapter 6</b><br/>
“Yes,” said our father, when Jem asked him if we could go over and sit by Miss&#160;<br/>
Rachel’s fishpool with Dill, as this was his last night in Maycomb. “Tell him so&#160;<br/>
long for me, and we’ll see him next summer.”<br/>
We leaped over the low wall that separated Miss Rachel’s yard from our&#160;<br/>
driveway. Jem whistled bob-white and Dill answered in the darkness.<br/>
“Not a breath blowing,” said Jem. “Looka yonder.”<br/>
He pointed to the east. A gigantic moon was rising behind Miss Maudie’s pecan&#160;<br/>
trees. “That makes it seem hotter,” he said.<br/>
“Cross in it tonight?” asked Dill, not looking up. He was constructing a cigarette&#160;<br/>
from newspaper and string.<br/>
“No, just the lady. Don’t light that thing, Dill, you’ll stink up this whole end of&#160;<br/>
town.”<br/>
There was a lady in the moon in Maycomb. She sat at a dresser combing her hair.<br/>
“We’re gonna miss you, boy,” I said. “Reckon we better watch for Mr. Avery?”<br/>
Mr. Avery boarded across the street from Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose’s house.&#160;<br/>
Besides making change in the collection plate every Sunday, Mr. Avery sat on the&#160;<br/>
porch every night until nine o’clock and sneezed. One evening we were privileged&#160;<br/>
to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last,&#160;<br/>
for he never did it again so long as we watched. Jem and I were leaving Miss&#160;<br/>
Rachel’s front steps one night when Dill stopped us: “Golly, looka yonder.” He&#160;<br/>
pointed across the street. At first we saw nothing but a kudzu-covered front porch,&#160;<br/>
but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and&#160;<br/>
splashing in the yellow circle of the street light, some ten feet from source to&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=52></a>earth, it seemed to us. Jem said Mr. Avery misfigured, Dill said he must drink a&#160;<br/>
gallon a day, and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and&#160;<br/>
respective prowess only made me feel left out again, as I was untalented in this&#160;<br/>
area.<br/>
Dill stretched, yawned, and said altogether too casually. “I know what, let’s go for&#160;<br/>
a walk.”<br/>
He sounded fishy to me. Nobody in Maycomb just went for a walk. “Where to,&#160;<br/>
Dill?”<br/>
Dill jerked his head in a southerly direction.<br/>
Jem said, “Okay.” When I protested, he said sweetly, “You don’t have to come&#160;<br/>
along, Angel May.”<br/>
“You don’t have to go. Remember-”<br/>
Jem was not one to dwell on past defeats: it seemed the only message he got from&#160;<br/>
Atticus was insight into the art of cross examination. “Scout, we ain’t gonna do&#160;<br/>
anything, we’re just goin‘ to the street light and back.”<br/>
We strolled silently down the sidewalk, listening to porch swings creaking with&#160;<br/>
the weight of the neighborhood, listening to the soft night-murmurs of the grown&#160;<br/>
people on our street. Occasionally we heard Miss Stephanie Crawford laugh.<br/>
“Well?” said Dill.<br/>
“Okay,” said Jem. “Why don’t you go on home, Scout?”<br/>
“What are you gonna do?”<br/>
Dill and Jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to&#160;<br/>
see if they could get a look at Boo Radley, and if I didn’t want to go with them I&#160;<br/>
could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut, that was all.<br/>
“But what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight?”<br/>
Because nobody could see them at night, because Atticus would be so deep in a&#160;<br/>
book he wouldn’t hear the Kingdom coming, because if Boo Radley killed them&#160;<br/>
they’d miss school instead of vacation, and because it was easier to see inside a&#160;<br/>
dark house in the dark than in the daytime, did I understand?<br/>
“Jem,&#160;<i>please</i>—”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=53></a>“Scout, I’m tellin‘ you for the last time, shut your trap or go home—I declare to&#160;<br/>
the Lord you’re gettin’ more like a girl every day!”<br/>
With that, I had no option but to join them. We thought it was better to go under&#160;<br/>
the high wire fence at the rear of the Radley lot, we stood less chance of being&#160;<br/>
seen. The fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse.<br/>
Jem held up the bottom wire and motioned Dill under it. I followed, and held up&#160;<br/>
the wire for Jem. It was a tight squeeze for him. “Don’t make a sound,” he&#160;<br/>
whispered. “Don’t get in a row of collards whatever you do, they’ll wake the&#160;<br/>
dead.”<br/>
With this thought in mind, I made perhaps one step per minute. I moved faster&#160;<br/>
when I saw Jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight. We came to the gate that&#160;<br/>
divided the garden from the back yard. Jem touched it. The gate squeaked.<br/>
“Spit on it,” whispered Dill.<br/>
“You’ve got us in a box, Jem,” I muttered. “We can’t get out of here so easy.”<br/>
“Sh-h. Spit on it, Scout.”<br/>
We spat ourselves dry, and Jem opened the gate slowly, lifting it aside and resting&#160;<br/>
it on the fence. We were in the back yard.<br/>
The back of the Radley house was less inviting than the front: a ramshackle porch&#160;<br/>
ran the width of the house; there were two doors and two dark windows between&#160;<br/>
the doors. Instead of a column, a rough two-by-four supported one end of the&#160;<br/>
roof. An old Franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch; above it a hat-rack mirror&#160;<br/>
caught the moon and shone eerily.<br/>
“Ar-r,” said Jem softly, lifting his foot.<br/>
“‘Smatter?”<br/>
“Chickens,” he breathed.<br/>
That we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed&#160;<br/>
when Dill ahead of us spelled G-o-d in a whisper. We crept to the side of the&#160;<br/>
house, around to the window with the hanging shutter. The sill was several inches&#160;<br/>
taller than Jem.<br/>
“Give you a hand up,” he muttered to Dill. “Wait, though.” Jem grabbed his left&#160;<br/>
wrist and my right wrist, I grabbed my left wrist and Jem’s right wrist, we&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=54></a>crouched, and Dill sat on our saddle. We raised him and he caught the window sill.<br/>
“Hurry,” Jem whispered, “we can’t last much longer.”<br/>
Dill punched my shoulder, and we lowered him to the ground.<br/>
“What’d you see?”<br/>
“Nothing. Curtains. There’s a little teeny light way off somewhere, though.”<br/>
“Let’s get away from here,” breathed Jem. “Let’s go ‘round in back again. Sh-h,”&#160;<br/>
he warned me, as I was about to protest.<br/>
“Let’s try the back window.”<br/>
“Dill,&#160;<i>no</i>,” I said.<br/>
Dill stopped and let Jem go ahead. When Jem put his foot on the bottom step, the&#160;<br/>
step squeaked. He stood still, then tried his weight by degrees. The step was&#160;<br/>
silent. Jem skipped two steps, put his foot on the porch, heaved himself to it, and&#160;<br/>
teetered a long moment. He regained his balance and dropped to his knees. He&#160;<br/>
crawled to the window, raised his head and looked in.<br/>
Then I saw the shadow. It was the shadow of a man with a hat on. At first I&#160;<br/>
thought it was a tree, but there was no wind blowing, and tree-trunks never&#160;<br/>
walked. The back porch was bathed in moonlight, and the shadow, crisp as toast,&#160;<br/>
moved across the porch toward Jem.<br/>
Dill saw it next. He put his hands to his face.<br/>
When it crossed Jem, Jem saw it. He put his arms over his head and went rigid.<br/>
The shadow stopped about a foot beyond Jem. Its arm came out from its side,&#160;<br/>
dropped, and was still. Then it turned and moved back across Jem, walked along&#160;<br/>
the porch and off the side of the house, returning as it had come.<br/>
Jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us. He flung open the gate, danced&#160;<br/>
Dill and me through, and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards.&#160;<br/>
Halfway through the collards I tripped; as I tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered&#160;<br/>
the neighborhood.<br/>
Dill and Jem dived beside me. Jem’s breath came in sobs: “Fence by the&#160;<br/>
schoolyard!—hurry, Scout!”<br/>
Jem held the bottom wire; Dill and I rolled through and were halfway to the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=55></a>shelter of the schoolyard’s solitary oak when we sensed that Jem was not with us.&#160;<br/>
We ran back and found him struggling in the fence, kicking his pants off to get&#160;<br/>
loose. He ran to the oak tree in his shorts.<br/>
Safely behind it, we gave way to numbness, but Jem’s mind was racing: “We&#160;<br/>
gotta get home, they’ll miss us.”<br/>
We ran across the schoolyard, crawled under the fence to Deer’s Pasture behind&#160;<br/>
our house, climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before Jem would&#160;<br/>
let us pause to rest.<br/>
Respiration normal, the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front&#160;<br/>
yard. We looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the Radley front&#160;<br/>
gate.<br/>
“We better go down there,” said Jem. “They’ll think it’s funny if we don’t show&#160;<br/>
up.”<br/>
Mr. Nathan Radley was standing inside his gate, a shotgun broken across his arm.&#160;<br/>
Atticus was standing beside Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss&#160;<br/>
Rachel and Mr. Avery were near by. None of them saw us come up.<br/>
We eased in beside Miss Maudie, who looked around. “Where were you all,&#160;<br/>
didn’t you hear the commotion?”<br/>
“What happened?” asked Jem.<br/>
“Mr. Radley shot at a Negro in his collard patch.”<br/>
“Oh. Did he hit him?”<br/>
“No,” said Miss Stephanie. “Shot in the air. Scared him pale, though. Says if&#160;<br/>
anybody sees a white nigger around, that’s the one. Says he’s got the other barrel&#160;<br/>
waitin‘ for the next sound he hears in that patch, an’ next time he won’t aim high,&#160;<br/>
be it dog, nigger, or—Jem&#160;<i>Finch!</i>”<br/>
“Ma’am?” asked Jem.<br/>
Atticus spoke. “Where’re your pants, son?”<br/>
“Pants, sir?”<br/>
“Pants.”<br/>
It was no use. In his shorts before God and everybody. I sighed.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=56></a>“Ah—Mr. Finch?”<br/>
In the glare from the streetlight, I could see Dill hatching one: his eyes widened,&#160;<br/>
his fat cherub face grew rounder.<br/>
“What is it, Dill?” asked Atticus.<br/>
“Ah—I won ‘em from him,” he said vaguely.<br/>
“Won them? How?”<br/>
Dill’s hand sought the back of his head. He brought it forward and across his&#160;<br/>
forehead. “We were playin‘ strip poker up yonder by the fishpool,” he said.<br/>
Jem and I relaxed. The neighbors seemed satisfied: they all stiffened. But what&#160;<br/>
was strip poker?<br/>
We had no chance to find out: Miss Rachel went off like the town fire siren: “Do-<br/>
o-o Jee-sus, Dill Harris! Gamblin‘ by my fishpool? I’ll strip-poker you, sir!”<br/>
Atticus saved Dill from immediate dismemberment. “Just a minute, Miss Rachel,”&#160;<br/>
he said. “I’ve never heard of ‘em doing that before. Were you all playing cards?”<br/>
Jem fielded Dill’s fly with his eyes shut: “No sir, just with matches.”<br/>
I admired my brother. Matches were dangerous, but cards were fatal.<br/>
“Jem, Scout,” said Atticus, “I don’t want to hear of poker in any form again. Go&#160;<br/>
by Dill’s and get your pants, Jem. Settle it yourselves.”<br/>
“Don’t worry, Dill,” said Jem, as we trotted up the sidewalk, “she ain’t gonna get&#160;<br/>
you. He’ll talk her out of it. That was fast thinkin‘, son. Listen… you hear?”<br/>
We stopped, and heard Atticus’s voice:“…not serious… they all go through it,&#160;<br/>
Miss Rachel…”<br/>
Dill was comforted, but Jem and I weren’t. There was the problem of Jem&#160;<br/>
showing up some pants in the morning.<br/>
“‘d give you some of mine,” said Dill, as we came to Miss Rachel’s steps. Jem&#160;<br/>
said he couldn’t get in them, but thanks anyway. We said good-bye, and Dill went&#160;<br/>
inside the house. He evidently remembered he was engaged to me, for he ran back&#160;<br/>
out and kissed me swiftly in front of Jem. “Yawl write, hear?” he bawled after us.<br/>
Had Jem’s pants been safely on him, we would not have slept much anyway.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=57></a>Every night-sound I heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three-<br/>
fold; every scratch of feet on gravel was Boo Radley seeking revenge, every&#160;<br/>
passing Negro laughing in the night was Boo Radley loose and after us; insects&#160;<br/>
splashing against the screen were Boo Radley’s insane fingers picking the wire to&#160;<br/>
pieces; the chinaberry trees were malignant, hovering, alive. I lingered between&#160;<br/>
sleep and wakefulness until I heard Jem murmur.<br/>
“Sleep, Little Three-Eyes?”<br/>
“Are you crazy?”<br/>
“Sh-h. Atticus’s light’s out.”<br/>
In the waning moonlight I saw Jem swing his feet to the floor.<br/>
“I’m goin‘ after ’em,” he said.<br/>
I sat upright. “You can’t. I won’t let you.”<br/>
He was struggling into his shirt. “I’ve got to.”<br/>
“You do an‘ I’ll wake up Atticus.”<br/>
“You do and I’ll kill you.”<br/>
I pulled him down beside me on the cot. I tried to reason with him. “Mr. Nathan’s&#160;<br/>
gonna find ‘em in the morning, Jem. He knows you lost ’em. When he shows ‘em&#160;<br/>
to Atticus it’ll be pretty bad, that’s all there is to it. Go’n back to bed.”<br/>
“That’s what I know,” said Jem. “That’s why I’m goin‘ after ’em.”<br/>
I began to feel sick. Going back to that place by himself—I remembered Miss&#160;<br/>
Stephanie: Mr. Nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard,&#160;<br/>
be it nigger, dog… Jem knew that better than I.<br/>
I was desperate: “Look, it ain’t worth it, Jem. A lickin‘ hurts but it doesn’t last.&#160;<br/>
You’ll get your head shot off, Jem. Please…”<br/>
He blew out his breath patiently. “I—it’s like this, Scout,” he muttered. “Atticus&#160;<br/>
ain’t ever whipped me since I can remember. I wanta keep it that way.”<br/>
This was a thought. It seemed that Atticus threatened us every other day. “You&#160;<br/>
mean he’s never caught you at anything.”<br/>
“Maybe so, but—I just wanta keep it that way, Scout. We shouldn’a done that&#160;<br/>
tonight, Scout.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=58></a>It was then, I suppose, that Jem and I first began to part company. Sometimes I&#160;<br/>
did not understand him, but my periods of bewilderment were short-lived. This&#160;<br/>
was beyond me. “Please,” I pleaded, “can’tcha just think about it for a minute—<br/>
by yourself on that place—”<br/>
“Shut up!”<br/>
“It’s not like he’d never speak to you again or somethin‘… I’m gonna wake him&#160;<br/>
up, Jem, I swear I am—”<br/>
Jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight. “Then I’m goin‘ with you<br/>
—” I choked.<br/>
“No you ain’t, you’ll just make noise.”<br/>
It was no use. I unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps.&#160;<br/>
It must have been two o’clock. The moon was setting and the lattice-work&#160;<br/>
shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness. Jem’s white shirt-tail dipped and&#160;<br/>
bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning. A faint&#160;<br/>
breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides.<br/>
He went the back way, through Deer’s Pasture, across the schoolyard and around&#160;<br/>
to the fence, I thought—at least that was the way he was headed. It would take&#160;<br/>
longer, so it was not time to worry yet. I waited until it was time to worry and&#160;<br/>
listened for Mr. Radley’s shotgun. Then I thought I heard the back fence squeak.&#160;<br/>
It was wishful thinking.<br/>
Then I heard Atticus cough. I held my breath. Sometimes when we made a&#160;<br/>
midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading. He said he often&#160;<br/>
woke up during the night, checked on us, and read himself back to sleep. I waited&#160;<br/>
for his light to go on, straining my eyes to see it flood the hall. It stayed off, and I&#160;<br/>
breathed again. The night-crawlers had retired, but ripe chinaberries drummed on&#160;<br/>
the roof when the wind stirred, and the darkness was desolate with the barking of&#160;<br/>
distant dogs.<br/>
There he was, returning to me. His white shirt bobbed over the back fence and&#160;<br/>
slowly grew larger. He came up the back steps, latched the door behind him, and&#160;<br/>
sat on his cot. Wordlessly, he held up his pants. He lay down, and for a while I&#160;<br/>
heard his cot trembling. Soon he was still. I did not hear him stir again.<br/>

<b>Chapter 7</b><br/>
Jem stayed moody and silent for a week. As Atticus had once advised me to do, I&#160;<br/>
tried to climb into Jem’s skin and walk around in it: if I had gone alone to the&#160;<br/>
Radley Place at two in the morning, my funeral would have been held the next&#160;<br/>
afternoon. So I left Jem alone and tried not to bother him.<br/>
School started. The second grade was as bad as the first, only worse—they still&#160;<br/>
flashed cards at you and wouldn’t let you read or write. Miss Caroline’s progress&#160;<br/>
next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter; however, the usual&#160;<br/>
crew had flunked the first grade again, and were helpful in keeping order. The&#160;<br/>
only thing good about the second grade was that this year I had to stay as late as&#160;<br/>
Jem, and we usually walked home together at three o’clock.<br/>
One afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home, Jem suddenly&#160;<br/>
said: “There’s something I didn’t tell you.”<br/>
As this was his first complete sentence in several days, I encouraged him: “About&#160;<br/>
what?”<br/>
“About that night.”<br/>
“You’ve never told me anything about that night,” I said.<br/>
Jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats. He was silent for a while, then he&#160;<br/>
said, “When I went back for my breeches—they were all in a tangle when I was&#160;<br/>
gettin‘ out of ’em, I couldn’t get ‘em loose. When I went back—” Jem took a&#160;<br/>
deep breath. “When I went back, they were folded across the fence… like they&#160;<br/>
were expectin’ me.”<br/>
“Across—”<br/>
“And something else—” Jem’s voice was flat. “Show you when we get home.&#160;<br/>
They’d been sewed up. Not like a lady sewed ‘em, like somethin’ I’d try to do.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=60></a>All crooked. It’s almost like—”<br/>
“—somebody knew you were comin‘ back for ’em.”<br/>
Jem shuddered. “Like somebody was readin‘ my mind… like somebody could tell&#160;<br/>
what I was gonna do. Can’t anybody tell what I’m gonna do lest they know me,&#160;<br/>
can they, Scout?”<br/>
Jem’s question was an appeal. I reassured him: “Can’t anybody tell what you’re&#160;<br/>
gonna do lest they live in the house with you, and even I can’t tell sometimes.”<br/>
We were walking past our tree. In its knot-hole rested a ball of gray twine.<br/>
“Don’t take it, Jem,” I said. “This is somebody’s hidin‘ place.”<br/>
“I don’t think so, Scout.”<br/>
“Yes it is. Somebody like Walter Cunningham comes down here every recess and&#160;<br/>
hides his things—and we come along and take ‘em away from him. Listen, let’s&#160;<br/>
leave it and wait a couple of days. If it ain’t gone then, we’ll take it, okay?”<br/>
“Okay, you might be right,” said Jem. “It must be some little kid’s place—hides&#160;<br/>
his things from the bigger folks. You know it’s only when school’s in that we’ve&#160;<br/>
found things.”<br/>
“Yeah,” I said, “but we never go by here in the summertime.”<br/>
We went home. Next morning the twine was where we had left it. When it was&#160;<br/>
still there on the third day, Jem pocketed it. From then on, we considered&#160;<br/>
everything we found in the knot-hole our property. -<br/>
The second grade was grim, but Jem assured me that the older I got the better&#160;<br/>
school would be, that he started off the same way, and it was not until one&#160;<br/>
reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value. The sixth grade&#160;<br/>
seemed to please him from the beginning: he went through a brief Egyptian&#160;<br/>
Period that baffled me—he tried to walk flat a great deal, sticking one arm in&#160;<br/>
front of him and one in back of him, putting one foot behind the other. He&#160;<br/>
declared Egyptians walked that way; I said if they did I didn’t see how they got&#160;<br/>
anything done, but Jem said they accomplished more than the Americans ever&#160;<br/>
did, they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming, and asked where would&#160;<br/>
we be today if they hadn’t? Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I’d have&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=61></a>the facts.<br/>
There are no clearly defined seasons in South Alabama; summer drifts into&#160;<br/>
autumn, and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter, but turns to a days-<br/>
old spring that melts into summer again. That fall was a long one, hardly cool&#160;<br/>
enough for a light jacket. Jem and I were trotting in our orbit one mild October&#160;<br/>
afternoon when our knot-hole stopped us again. Something white was inside this&#160;<br/>
time.<br/>
Jem let me do the honors: I pulled out two small images carved in soap. One was&#160;<br/>
the figure of a boy, the other wore a crude dress. Before I remembered that there&#160;<br/>
was no such thing as hoo-dooing, I shrieked and threw them down.<br/>
Jem snatched them up. “What’s the matter with you?” he yelled. He rubbed the&#160;<br/>
figures free of red dust. “These are good,” he said. “I’ve never seen any these&#160;<br/>
good.”<br/>
He held them down to me. They were almost perfect miniatures of two children.&#160;<br/>
The boy had on shorts, and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows. I looked up&#160;<br/>
at Jem. A point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part. I had&#160;<br/>
never noticed it before. Jem looked from the girl-doll to me. The girl-doll wore&#160;<br/>
bangs. So did I.<br/>
“These are us,” he said.<br/>
“Who did ‘em, you reckon?”<br/>
“Who do we know around here who whittles?” he asked.<br/>
“Mr. Avery.”<br/>
“Mr. Avery just does like this. I mean carves.”<br/>
Mr. Avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week; he honed it down to a&#160;<br/>
toothpick and chewed it.<br/>
“There’s old Miss Stephanie Crawford’s sweetheart,” I said.<br/>
“He carves all right, but he lives down the country. When would he ever pay any&#160;<br/>
attention to us?”<br/>
“Maybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of Miss Stephanie. If I was&#160;<br/>
him, I would.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=62></a>Jem stared at me so long I asked what was the matter, but got Nothing, Scout for&#160;<br/>
an answer. When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.<br/>
Less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which we&#160;<br/>
enjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped&#160;<br/>
Jem’s memory.<br/>
The following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to&#160;<br/>
Atticus, who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb&#160;<br/>
County schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus&#160;<br/>
said someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me&#160;<br/>
when I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered&#160;<br/>
anybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.<br/>
Our biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn’t&#160;<br/>
run, on a chain with an aluminum knife.<br/>
“You reckon it’s white gold, Jem?”<br/>
“Don’t know. I’ll show it to Atticus.”<br/>
Atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were&#160;<br/>
new. “Did you swap with somebody at school?” he asked.<br/>
“Oh, no sir!” Jem pulled out his grandfather’s watch that Atticus let him carry&#160;<br/>
once a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem&#160;<br/>
walked on eggs. “Atticus, if it’s all right with you, I’d rather have this one instead.&#160;<br/>
Maybe I can fix it.”<br/>
When the new wore off his grandfather’s watch, and carrying it became a day’s&#160;<br/>
burdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every&#160;<br/>
five minutes.<br/>
He did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch&#160;<br/>
would not run. “Oh-h,” he sighed, “it’ll never go. Scout—?”<br/>
“Huh?”<br/>
“You reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever’s leaving us these things?”<br/>
“That’d be right nice, Jem, we can thank ‘em—what’s wrong?”<br/>
Jem was holding his ears, shaking his head from side to side. “I don’t get it, I just&#160;<br/>
don’t get it—I don’t know why, Scout…” He looked toward the livingroom. “I’ve&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=63></a>gotta good mind to tell Atticus—no, I reckon not.”<br/>
“I’ll tell him for you.”<br/>
“No, don’t do that, Scout. Scout?”<br/>
“Wha-t?”<br/>
He had been on the verge of telling me something all evening; his face would&#160;<br/>
brighten and he would lean toward me, then he would change his mind. He&#160;<br/>
changed it again. “Oh, nothin‘.”<br/>
“Here, let’s write a letter.” I pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose.<br/>
“Okay. Dear Mister…”<br/>
“How do you know it’s a man? I bet it’s Miss Maudie—been bettin‘ that for a&#160;<br/>
long time.”<br/>
“Ar-r, Miss Maudie can’t chew gum—” Jem broke into a grin. “You know, she&#160;<br/>
can talk real pretty sometimes. One time I asked her to have a chew and she said&#160;<br/>
no thanks, that—chewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless,”&#160;<br/>
said Jem carefully. “Doesn’t that sound nice?”<br/>
“Yeah, she can say nice things sometimes. She wouldn’t have a watch and chain&#160;<br/>
anyway.”<br/>
“Dear sir,” said Jem. “We appreciate the—no, we appreciate everything which&#160;<br/>
you have put into the tree for us. Yours very truly, Jeremy Atticus Finch.”<br/>
“He won’t know who you are if you sign it like that, Jem.”<br/>
Jem erased his name and wrote, “Jem Finch.” I signed, “Jean Louise Finch&#160;<br/>
(Scout),” beneath it. Jem put the note in an envelope.<br/>
Next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree.&#160;<br/>
Jem was facing me when he looked up, and I saw him go stark white.<br/>
“<i>Scout!</i>”<br/>
I ran to him.<br/>
Someone had filled our knot-hole with cement.<br/>
“Don’t you cry, now, Scout… don’t cry now, don’t you worry-” he muttered at&#160;<br/>
me all the way to school.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=64></a>When we went home for dinner Jem bolted his food, ran to the porch and stood on&#160;<br/>
the steps. I followed him. “Hasn’t passed by yet,” he said.<br/>
Next day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded.<br/>
“Hidy do, Mr. Nathan,” he said.<br/>
“Morning Jem, Scout,” said Mr. Radley, as he went by.<br/>
“Mr. Radley,” said Jem.<br/>
Mr. Radley turned around.<br/>
“Mr. Radley, ah—did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder?”<br/>
“Yes,” he said. “I filled it up.”<br/>
“Why’d you do it, sir?”<br/>
“Tree’s dying. You plug ‘em with cement when they’re sick. You ought to know&#160;<br/>
that, Jem.”<br/>
Jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he&#160;<br/>
gave it a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed&#160;<br/>
to be working himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.<br/>
As usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at&#160;<br/>
our steps Jem said, “Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”<br/>
“What tree, son?”<br/>
“The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin‘ from school.”<br/>
“Yes?”<br/>
“Is that tree dyin‘?”<br/>
“Why no, son, I don’t think so. Look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no&#160;<br/>
brown patches anywhere—”<br/>
“It ain’t even sick?”<br/>
“That tree’s as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?”<br/>
“Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin‘.”<br/>
“Well maybe it is. I’m sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.”<br/>
Atticus left us on the porch. Jem leaned on a pillar, rubbing his shoulders against&#160;<br/>
it.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=65></a>“Do you itch, Jem?” I asked as politely as I could. He did not answer. “Come on&#160;<br/>
in, Jem,” I said.<br/>
“After while.”<br/>
He stood there until nightfall, and I waited for him. When we went in the house I&#160;<br/>
saw he had been crying; his face was dirty in the right places, but I thought it odd&#160;<br/>
that I had not heard him.<br/>

<b>Chapter 8</b><br/>
For reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in Maycomb County,&#160;<br/>
autumn turned to winter that year. We had two weeks of the coldest weather since&#160;<br/>
1885, Atticus said. Mr. Avery said it was written on the Rosetta Stone that when&#160;<br/>
children disobeyed their parents, smoked cigarettes and made war on each other,&#160;<br/>
the seasons would change: Jem and I were burdened with the guilt of contributing&#160;<br/>
to the aberrations of nature, thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and&#160;<br/>
discomfort to ourselves.<br/>
Old Mrs. Radley died that winter, but her death caused hardly a ripple—the&#160;<br/>
neighborhood seldom saw her, except when she watered her cannas. Jem and I&#160;<br/>
decided that Boo had got her at last, but when Atticus returned from the Radley&#160;<br/>
house he said she died of natural causes, to our disappointment.<br/>
“Ask him,” Jem whispered.<br/>
“You ask him, you’re the oldest.”<br/>
“That’s why you oughta ask him.”<br/>
“Atticus,” I said, “did you see Mr. Arthur?”<br/>
Atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me: “I did not.”<br/>
Jem restrained me from further questions. He said Atticus was still touchous&#160;<br/>
about us and the Radleys and it wouldn’t do to push him any. Jem had a notion&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=66></a>that Atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined&#160;<br/>
to strip poker. Jem had no firm basis for his ideas, he said it was merely a twitch.<br/>
Next morning I awoke, looked out the window and nearly died of fright. My&#160;<br/>
screams brought Atticus from his bathroom half-shaven.<br/>
“The&#160;<i>world’s</i>&#160;endin‘, Atticus! Please do something—!” I dragged him to the&#160;<br/>
window and pointed.<br/>
“No it’s not,” he said. “It’s snowing.”<br/>
Jem asked Atticus would it keep up. Jem had never seen snow either, but he knew&#160;<br/>
what it was. Atticus said he didn’t know any more about snow than Jem did. “I&#160;<br/>
think, though, if it’s watery like that, it’ll turn to rain.”<br/>
The telephone rang and Atticus left the breakfast table to answer it. “That was&#160;<br/>
Eula May,” he said when he returned. “I quote—‘As it has not snowed in&#160;<br/>
Maycomb County since 1885, there will be no school today.’”<br/>
Eula May was Maycomb’s leading telephone operator. She was entrusted with&#160;<br/>
issuing public announcements, wedding invitations, setting off the fire siren, and&#160;<br/>
giving first-aid instructions when Dr. Reynolds was away.<br/>
When Atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of&#160;<br/>
out the windows, Jem asked, “How do you make a snowman?”<br/>
“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said Atticus. “I don’t want you all to be&#160;<br/>
disappointed, but I doubt if there’ll be enough snow for a snowball, even.”<br/>
Calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking. When we ran to the back&#160;<br/>
yard, it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow.<br/>
“We shouldn’t walk about in it,” said Jem. “Look, every step you take’s wasting&#160;<br/>
it.”<br/>
I looked back at my mushy footprints. Jem said if we waited until it snowed some&#160;<br/>
more we could scrape it all up for a snowman. I stuck out my tongue and caught a&#160;<br/>
fat flake. It burned.<br/>
“Jem, it’s hot!”<br/>
“No it ain’t, it’s so cold it burns. Now don’t eat it, Scout, you’re wasting it. Let it&#160;<br/>
come down.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=67></a>“But I want to walk in it.”<br/>
“I know what, we can go walk over at Miss Maudie’s.”<br/>
Jem hopped across the front yard. I followed in his tracks. When we were on the&#160;<br/>
sidewalk in front of Miss Maudie’s, Mr. Avery accosted us. He had a pink face&#160;<br/>
and a big stomach below his belt.<br/>
“See what you’ve done?” he said. “Hasn’t snowed in Maycomb since&#160;<br/>
Appomattox. It’s bad children like you makes the seasons change.”<br/>
I wondered if Mr. Avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for&#160;<br/>
him to repeat his performance, and reflected that if this was our reward, there was&#160;<br/>
something to say for sin. I did not wonder where Mr. Avery gathered his&#160;<br/>
meteorological statistics: they came straight from the Rosetta Stone.<br/>
“Jem Finch, you Jem Finch!”<br/>
“Miss Maudie’s callin‘ you, Jem.”<br/>
“You all stay in the middle of the yard. There’s some thrift buried under the snow&#160;<br/>
near the porch. Don’t step on it!”<br/>
“Yessum!” called Jem. “It’s beautiful, ain’t it, Miss Maudie?”<br/>
“Beautiful my hind foot! If it freezes tonight it’ll carry off all my azaleas!”<br/>
Miss Maudie’s old sunhat glistened with snow crystals. She was bending over&#160;<br/>
some small bushes, wrapping them in burlap bags. Jem asked her what she was&#160;<br/>
doing that for.<br/>
“Keep ‘em warm,” she said.<br/>
“How can flowers keep warm? They don’t circulate.”<br/>
“I cannot answer that question, Jem Finch. All I know is if it freezes tonight these&#160;<br/>
plants’ll freeze, so you cover ‘em up. Is that clear?”<br/>
“Yessum. Miss Maudie?”<br/>
“What, sir?”<br/>
“Could Scout and me borrow some of your snow?”<br/>
“Heavens alive, take it all! There’s an old peach basket under the house, haul it&#160;<br/>
off in that.” Miss Maudie’s eyes narrowed. “Jem Finch, what are you going to do&#160;<br/>
with my snow?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=68></a>“You’ll see,” said Jem, and we transferred as much snow as we could from Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie’s yard to ours, a slushy operation.<br/>
“What are we gonna do, Jem?” I asked.<br/>
“You’ll see,” he said. “Now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up&#160;<br/>
from the back yard to the front. Walk back in your tracks, though,” he cautioned.<br/>
“Are we gonna have a snow baby, Jem?”<br/>
“No, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now.”<br/>
Jem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly&#160;<br/>
behind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He went in the&#160;<br/>
house, returned with the laundry hamper, filled it with earth and carried it to the&#160;<br/>
front yard.<br/>
When we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said we were&#160;<br/>
ready to begin.<br/>
“Don’t you think this is kind of a mess?” I asked.<br/>
“Looks messy now, but it won’t later,” he said.<br/>
Jem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he added&#160;<br/>
another load, and another until he had constructed a torso.<br/>
“Jem, I ain’t ever heard of a nigger snowman,” I said.<br/>
“He won’t be black long,” he grunted.<br/>
Jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited them, and bent&#160;<br/>
them into bones to be covered with dirt.<br/>
“He looks like Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips,” I said. “Fat in the&#160;<br/>
middle and little-bitty arms.”<br/>
“I’ll make ‘em bigger.” Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more&#160;<br/>
dirt. He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a big stomach&#160;<br/>
below the figure’s waistline. Jem glanced at me, his eyes twinkling: “Mr. Avery’s&#160;<br/>
sort of shaped like a snowman, ain’t he?”<br/>
Jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on. He permitted me to cover&#160;<br/>
only the back, saving the public parts for himself. Gradually Mr. Avery turned&#160;<br/>
white.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=69></a>Using bits of wood for eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons, Jem succeeded in making&#160;<br/>
Mr. Avery look cross. A stick of stovewood completed the picture. Jem stepped&#160;<br/>
back and viewed his creation.<br/>
“It’s lovely, Jem,” I said. “Looks almost like he’d talk to you.”<br/>
“It is, ain’t it?” he said shyly.<br/>
We could not wait for Atticus to come home for dinner, but called and said we&#160;<br/>
had a big surprise for him. He seemed surprised when he saw most of the back&#160;<br/>
yard in the front yard, but he said we had done a jim-dandy job. “I didn’t know&#160;<br/>
how you were going to do it,” he said to Jem, “but from now on I’ll never worry&#160;<br/>
about what’ll become of you, son, you’ll always have an idea.”<br/>
Jem’s ears reddened from Atticus’s compliment, but he looked up sharply when&#160;<br/>
he saw Atticus stepping back. Atticus squinted at the snowman a while. He&#160;<br/>
grinned, then laughed. “Son, I can’t tell what you’re going to be—an engineer, a&#160;<br/>
lawyer, or a portrait painter. You’ve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard.&#160;<br/>
We’ve got to disguise this fellow.”<br/>
Atticus suggested that Jem hone down his creation’s front a little, swap a broom&#160;<br/>
for the stovewood, and put an apron on him.<br/>
Jem explained that if he did, the snowman would become muddy and cease to be&#160;<br/>
a snowman.<br/>
“I don’t care what you do, so long as you do something,” said Atticus. “You can’t&#160;<br/>
go around making caricatures of the neighbors.”<br/>
“Ain’t a characterture,” said Jem. “It looks just like him.”<br/>
“Mr. Avery might not think so.”<br/>
“I know what!” said Jem. He raced across the street, disappeared into Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie’s back yard and returned triumphant. He stuck her sunhat on the&#160;<br/>
snowman’s head and jammed her hedge-clippers into the crook of his arm.&#160;<br/>
Atticus said that would be fine.<br/>
Miss Maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch. She looked across&#160;<br/>
the street at us. Suddenly she grinned. “Jem Finch,” she called. “You devil, bring&#160;<br/>
me back my hat, sir!”<br/>
Jem looked up at Atticus, who shook his head. “She’s just fussing,” he said.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=70></a>“She’s really impressed with your—accomplishments.”<br/>
Atticus strolled over to Miss Maudie’s sidewalk, where they engaged in an arm-<br/>
waving conversation, the only phrase of which I caught was “…erected an&#160;<br/>
absolute morphodite in that yard! Atticus, you’ll never raise ‘em!”<br/>
The snow stopped in the afternoon, the temperature dropped, and by nightfall Mr.&#160;<br/>
Avery’s direst predictions came true: Calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house&#160;<br/>
blazing, but we were cold. When Atticus came home that evening he said we&#160;<br/>
were in for it, and asked Calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night.&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought&#160;<br/>
she’d be warmer at her house. Atticus drove her home in the car.<br/>
Before I went to sleep Atticus put more coal on the fire in my room. He said the&#160;<br/>
thermometer registered sixteen, that it was the coldest night in his memory, and&#160;<br/>
that our snowman outside was frozen solid.<br/>
Minutes later, it seemed, I was awakened by someone shaking me. Atticus’s&#160;<br/>
overcoat was spread across me. “Is it morning already?”<br/>
“Baby, get up.”<br/>
Atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat. “Put your robe on first,” he said.<br/>
Jem was standing beside Atticus, groggy and tousled. He was holding his&#160;<br/>
overcoat closed at the neck, his other hand was jammed into his pocket. He&#160;<br/>
looked strangely overweight.<br/>
“Hurry, hon,” said Atticus. “Here’re your shoes and socks.”<br/>
Stupidly, I put them on. “Is it morning?”<br/>
“No, it’s a little after one. Hurry now.”<br/>
That something was wrong finally got through to me. “What’s the matter?”<br/>
By then he did not have to tell me. Just as the birds know where to go when it&#160;<br/>
rains, I knew when there was trouble in our street. Soft taffeta-like sounds and&#160;<br/>
muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless dread.<br/>
“Whose is it?”<br/>
“Miss Maudie’s, hon,” said Atticus gently.<br/>
At the front door, we saw fire spewing from Miss Maudie’s diningroom windows.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=71></a>As if to confirm what we saw, the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble&#160;<br/>
pitch and remained there, screaming.<br/>
“It’s gone, ain’t it?” moaned Jem.<br/>
“I expect so,” said Atticus. “Now listen, both of you. Go down and stand in front&#160;<br/>
of the Radley Place. Keep out of the way, do you hear? See which way the wind’s&#160;<br/>
blowing?”<br/>
“Oh,” said Jem. “Atticus, reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out?”<br/>
“Not yet, son. Do as I tell you. Run now. Take care of Scout, you hear? Don’t let&#160;<br/>
her out of your sight.”<br/>
With a push, Atticus started us toward the Radley front gate. We stood watching&#160;<br/>
the street fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured Miss Maudie’s house.&#160;<br/>
“Why don’t they hurry, why don’t they hurry…” muttered Jem.<br/>
We saw why. The old fire truck, killed by the cold, was being pushed from town&#160;<br/>
by a crowd of men. When the men attached its hose to a hydrant, the hose burst&#160;<br/>
and water shot up, tinkling down on the pavement.<br/>
“Oh-h Lord, Jem…”<br/>
Jem put his arm around me. “Hush, Scout,” he said. “It ain’t time to worry yet. I’ll&#160;<br/>
let you know when.”<br/>
The men of Maycomb, in all degrees of dress and undress, took furniture from&#160;<br/>
Miss Maudie’s house to a yard across the street. I saw Atticus carrying Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie’s heavy oak rocking chair, and thought it sensible of him to save what she&#160;<br/>
valued most.<br/>
Sometimes we heard shouts. Then Mr. Avery’s face appeared in an upstairs&#160;<br/>
window. He pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down&#160;<br/>
furniture until men shouted, “Come down from there, Dick! The stairs are going!&#160;<br/>
Get outta there, Mr. Avery!”<br/>
Mr. Avery began climbing through the window.<br/>
“Scout, he’s stuck…” breathed Jem. “Oh God…”<br/>
Mr. Avery was wedged tightly. I buried my head under Jem’s arm and didn’t look&#160;<br/>
again until Jem cried, “He’s got loose, Scout! He’s all right!”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=72></a>I looked up to see Mr. Avery cross the upstairs porch. He swung his legs over the&#160;<br/>
railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped. He fell, yelled, and hit&#160;<br/>
Miss Maudie’s shrubbery.<br/>
Suddenly I noticed that the men were backing away from Miss Maudie’s house,&#160;<br/>
moving down the street toward us. They were no longer carrying furniture. The&#160;<br/>
fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof: window&#160;<br/>
frames were black against a vivid orange center.<br/>
“Jem, it looks like a pumpkin—”<br/>
“Scout, look!”<br/>
Smoke was rolling off our house and Miss Rachel’s house like fog off a&#160;<br/>
riverbank, and men were pulling hoses toward them. Behind us, the fire truck&#160;<br/>
from Abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house.<br/>
“That book…” I said.<br/>
“What?” said Jem.<br/>
“That Tom Swift book, it ain’t mine, it’s Dill’s…”<br/>
“Don’t worry, Scout, it ain’t time to worry yet,” said Jem. He pointed. “Looka&#160;<br/>
yonder.”<br/>
In a group of neighbors, Atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat&#160;<br/>
pockets. He might have been watching a football game. Miss Maudie was beside&#160;<br/>
him.<br/>
“See there, he’s not worried yet,” said Jem.<br/>
“Why ain’t he on top of one of the houses?”<br/>
“He’s too old, he’d break his neck.”<br/>
“You think we oughta make him get our stuff out?”<br/>
“Let’s don’t pester him, he’ll know when it’s time,” said Jem.<br/>
The Abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house; a man on the roof&#160;<br/>
pointed to places that needed it most. I watched our Absolute Morphodite go&#160;<br/>
black and crumble; Miss Maudie’s sunhat settled on top of the heap. I could not&#160;<br/>
see her hedge-clippers. In the heat between our house, Miss Rachel’s and Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie’s, the men had long ago shed coats and bathrobes. They worked in&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=73></a>pajama tops and nightshirts stuffed into their pants, but I became aware that I was&#160;<br/>
slowly freezing where I stood. Jem tried to keep me warm, but his arm was not&#160;<br/>
enough. I pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders. By dancing a little, I could&#160;<br/>
feel my feet.<br/>
Another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of Miss Stephanie Crawford’s.&#160;<br/>
There was no hydrant for another hose, and the men tried to soak her house with&#160;<br/>
hand extinguishers.<br/>
Miss Maudie’s tin roof quelled the flames. Roaring, the house collapsed; fire&#160;<br/>
gushed everywhere, followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the&#160;<br/>
adjacent houses, beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood.<br/>
It was dawn before the men began to leave, first one by one, then in groups. They&#160;<br/>
pushed the Maycomb fire truck back to town, the Abbottsville truck departed, the&#160;<br/>
third one remained. We found out next day it had come from Clark’s Ferry, sixty&#160;<br/>
miles away.<br/>
Jem and I slid across the street. Miss Maudie was staring at the smoking black&#160;<br/>
hole in her yard, and Atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk. He&#160;<br/>
led us home, holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street. He said Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie would stay with Miss Stephanie for the time being.<br/>
“Anybody want some hot chocolate?” he asked. I shuddered when Atticus started&#160;<br/>
a fire in the kitchen stove.<br/>
As we drank our cocoa I noticed Atticus looking at me, first with curiosity, then&#160;<br/>
with sternness. “I thought I told you and Jem to stay put,” he said.<br/>
“Why, we did. We stayed—”<br/>
“Then whose blanket is that?”<br/>
“Blanket?”<br/>
“Yes ma’am, blanket. It isn’t ours.”<br/>
I looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket I was wearing&#160;<br/>
around my shoulders, squaw-fashion.<br/>
“Atticus, I don’t know, sir… I—”<br/>
I turned to Jem for an answer, but Jem was even more bewildered than I. He said&#160;<br/>
he didn’t know how it got there, we did exactly as Atticus had told us, we stood&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=74></a>down by the Radley gate away from everybody, we didn’t move an inch—Jem&#160;<br/>
stopped.<br/>
“Mr. Nathan was at the fire,” he babbled, “I saw him, I saw him, he was tuggin‘&#160;<br/>
that mattress—Atticus, I swear…”<br/>
“That’s all right, son.” Atticus grinned slowly. “Looks like all of Maycomb was&#160;<br/>
out tonight, in one way or another. Jem, there’s some wrapping paper in the&#160;<br/>
pantry, I think. Go get it and we’ll—”<br/>
“Atticus, no sir!”<br/>
Jem seemed to have lost his mind. He began pouring out our secrets right and left&#160;<br/>
in total disregard for my safety if not for his own, omitting nothing, knot-hole,&#160;<br/>
pants and all.<br/>
“…Mr. Nathan put cement in that tree, Atticus, an‘ he did it to stop us findin’&#160;<br/>
things—he’s crazy, I reckon, like they say, but Atticus, I swear to God he ain’t&#160;<br/>
ever harmed us, he ain’t ever hurt us, he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that&#160;<br/>
night but he tried to mend my pants instead… he ain’t ever hurt us, Atticus—”<br/>
Atticus said, “Whoa, son,” so gently that I was greatly heartened. It was obvious&#160;<br/>
that he had not followed a word Jem said, for all Atticus said was, “You’re right.&#160;<br/>
We’d better keep this and the blanket to ourselves. Someday, maybe, Scout can&#160;<br/>
thank him for covering her up.”<br/>
“Thank who?” I asked.<br/>
“Boo Radley. You were so busy looking at the fire you didn’t know it when he&#160;<br/>
put the blanket around you.”<br/>
My stomach turned to water and I nearly threw up when Jem held out the blanket&#160;<br/>
and crept toward me. “He sneaked out of the house—turn ‘round—sneaked up,&#160;<br/>
an’ went like this!”<br/>
Atticus said dryly, “Do not let this inspire you to further glory, Jeremy.”<br/>
Jem scowled, “I ain’t gonna do anything to him,” but I watched the spark of fresh&#160;<br/>
adventure leave his eyes. “Just think, Scout,” he said, “if you’d just turned&#160;<br/>
around, you’da seen him.”<br/>
Calpurnia woke us at noon. Atticus had said we need not go to school that day,&#160;<br/>
we’d learn nothing after no sleep. Calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=75></a>front yard.<br/>
Miss Maudie’s sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice, like a fly in amber,&#160;<br/>
and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedge-clippers. We found her in her back&#160;<br/>
yard, gazing at her frozen charred azaleas. “We’re bringing back your things,&#160;<br/>
Miss Maudie,” said Jem. “We’re awful sorry.”<br/>
Miss Maudie looked around, and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face.&#160;<br/>
“Always wanted a smaller house, Jem Finch. Gives me more yard. Just think, I’ll&#160;<br/>
have more room for my azaleas now!”<br/>
“You ain’t grievin‘, Miss Maudie?” I asked, surprised. Atticus said her house was&#160;<br/>
nearly all she had.<br/>
“Grieving, child? Why, I hated that old cow barn. Thought of settin‘ fire to it a&#160;<br/>
hundred times myself, except they’d lock me up.”<br/>
“But—”<br/>
“Don’t you worry about me, Jean Louise Finch. There are ways of doing things&#160;<br/>
you don’t know about. Why, I’ll build me a little house and take me a couple of&#160;<br/>
roomers and—gracious, I’ll have the finest yard in Alabama. Those&#160;<br/>
Bellingraths’ll look plain puny when I get started!”<br/>
Jem and I looked at each other. “How’d it catch, Miss Maudie?” he asked.<br/>
“I don’t know, Jem. Probably the flue in the kitchen. I kept a fire in there last&#160;<br/>
night for my potted plants. Hear you had some unexpected company last night,&#160;<br/>
Miss Jean Louise.”<br/>
“How’d you know?”<br/>
“Atticus told me on his way to town this morning. Tell you the truth, I’d like&#160;<br/>
to’ve been with you. And I’d‘ve had sense enough to turn around, too.”<br/>
Miss Maudie puzzled me. With most of her possessions gone and her beloved&#160;<br/>
yard a shambles, she still took a lively and cordial interest in Jem’s and my affairs.<br/>
She must have seen my perplexity. She said, “Only thing I worried about last&#160;<br/>
night was all the danger and commotion it caused. This whole neighborhood&#160;<br/>
could have gone up. Mr. Avery’ll be in bed for a week—he’s right stove up. He’s&#160;<br/>
too old to do things like that and I told him so. Soon as I can get my hands clean&#160;<br/>
and when Stephanie Crawford’s not looking, I’ll make him a Lane cake. That&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=76></a>Stephanie’s been after my recipe for thirty years, and if she thinks I’ll give it to&#160;<br/>
her just because I’m staying with her she’s got another think coming.”<br/>
I reflected that if Miss Maudie broke down and gave it to her, Miss Stephanie&#160;<br/>
couldn’t follow it anyway. Miss Maudie had once let me see it: among other&#160;<br/>
things, the recipe called for one large cup of sugar.<br/>
It was a still day. The air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock&#160;<br/>
clank, rattle and strain before it struck the hour. Miss Maudie’s nose was a color I&#160;<br/>
had never seen before, and I inquired about it.<br/>
“I’ve been out here since six o’clock,” she said. “Should be frozen by now.” She&#160;<br/>
held up her hands. A network of tiny lines crisscrossed her palms, brown with dirt&#160;<br/>
and dried blood.<br/>
“You’ve ruined ‘em,” said Jem. “Why don’t you get a colored man?” There was&#160;<br/>
no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added, “Or Scout’n’me, we can help&#160;<br/>
you.”<br/>
Miss Maudie said, “Thank you sir, but you’ve got a job of your own over there.”&#160;<br/>
She pointed to our yard.<br/>
“You mean the Morphodite?” I asked. “Shoot, we can rake him up in a jiffy.”<br/>
Miss Maudie stared down at me, her lips moving silently. Suddenly she put her&#160;<br/>
hands to her head and whooped. When we left her, she was still chuckling.<br/>
Jem said he didn’t know what was the matter with her—that was just Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie.<br/>

<b>Chapter 9</b><br/>
“You can just take that back, boy!”<br/>
This order, given by me to Cecil Jacobs, was the beginning of a rather thin time&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=77></a>for Jem and me. My fists were clenched and I was ready to let fly. Atticus had&#160;<br/>
promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more; I&#160;<br/>
was far too old and too big for such childish things, and the sooner I learned to&#160;<br/>
hold in, the better off everybody would be. I soon forgot.<br/>
Cecil Jacobs made me forget. He had announced in the schoolyard the day before&#160;<br/>
that Scout Finch’s daddy defended niggers. I denied it, but told Jem.<br/>
“What’d he mean sayin‘ that?” I asked.<br/>
“Nothing,” Jem said. “Ask Atticus, he’ll tell you.”<br/>
“Do you defend niggers, Atticus?” I asked him that evening.<br/>
“Of course I do. Don’t say nigger, Scout. That’s common.”<br/>
“‘s what everybody at school says.”<br/>
“From now on it’ll be everybody less one—”<br/>
“Well if you don’t want me to grow up talkin‘ that way, why do you send me to&#160;<br/>
school?”<br/>
My father looked at me mildly, amusement in his eyes. Despite our compromise,&#160;<br/>
my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first&#160;<br/>
day’s dose of it: the beginning of last September had brought on sinking spells,&#160;<br/>
dizziness, and mild gastric complaints. I went so far as to pay a nickel for the&#160;<br/>
privilege of rubbing my head against the head of Miss Rachel’s cook’s son, who&#160;<br/>
was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm. It didn’t take.<br/>
But I was worrying another bone. “Do all lawyers defend n-Negroes, Atticus?”<br/>
“Of course they do, Scout.”<br/>
“Then why did Cecil say you defended niggers? He made it sound like you were&#160;<br/>
runnin‘ a still.”<br/>
Atticus sighed. “I’m simply defending a Negro—his name’s Tom Robinson. He&#160;<br/>
lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump. He’s a member of&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia’s church, and Cal knows his family well. She says they’re clean-living&#160;<br/>
folks. Scout, you aren’t old enough to understand some things yet, but there’s&#160;<br/>
been some high talk around town to the effect that I shouldn’t do much about&#160;<br/>
defending this man. It’s a peculiar case—it won’t come to trial until summer&#160;<br/>
session. John Taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement…”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=78></a>“If you shouldn’t be defendin‘ him, then why are you doin’ it?”<br/>
“For a number of reasons,” said Atticus. “The main one is, if I didn’t I couldn’t&#160;<br/>
hold up my head in town, I couldn’t represent this county in the legislature, I&#160;<br/>
couldn’t even tell you or Jem not to do something again.”<br/>
“You mean if you didn’t defend that man, Jem and me wouldn’t have to mind you&#160;<br/>
any more?”<br/>
“That’s about right.”<br/>
“Why?”<br/>
“Because I could never ask you to mind me again. Scout, simply by the nature of&#160;<br/>
the work, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him&#160;<br/>
personally. This one’s mine, I guess. You might hear some ugly talk about it at&#160;<br/>
school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep&#160;<br/>
those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don’t you let ‘em get your&#160;<br/>
goat. Try fighting with your head for a change… it’s a good one, even if it does&#160;<br/>
resist learning.”<br/>
“Atticus, are we going to win it?”<br/>
“No, honey.”<br/>
“Then why—”<br/>
“Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason&#160;<br/>
for us not to try to win,” Atticus said.<br/>
“You sound like Cousin Ike Finch,” I said. Cousin Ike Finch was Maycomb&#160;<br/>
County’s sole surviving Confederate veteran. He wore a General Hood type beard&#160;<br/>
of which he was inordinately vain. At least once a year Atticus, Jem and I called&#160;<br/>
on him, and I would have to kiss him. It was horrible. Jem and I would listen&#160;<br/>
respectfully to Atticus and Cousin Ike rehash the war. “Tell you, Atticus,” Cousin&#160;<br/>
Ike would say, “the Missouri Compromise was what licked us, but if I had to go&#160;<br/>
through it agin I’d walk every step of the way there an‘ every step back jist like I&#160;<br/>
did before an’ furthermore we’d whip ‘em this time… now in 1864, when&#160;<br/>
Stonewall Jackson came around by—I beg your pardon, young folks. Ol’ Blue&#160;<br/>
Light was in heaven then, God rest his saintly brow…”<br/>
“Come here, Scout,” said Atticus. I crawled into his lap and tucked my head&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=79></a>under his chin. He put his arms around me and rocked me gently. “It’s different&#160;<br/>
this time,” he said. “This time we aren’t fighting the Yankees, we’re fighting our&#160;<br/>
friends. But remember this, no matter how bitter things get, they’re still our&#160;<br/>
friends and this is still our home.”<br/>
With this in mind, I faced Cecil Jacobs in the schoolyard next day: “You gonna&#160;<br/>
take that back, boy?”<br/>
“You gotta make me first!” he yelled. “My folks said your daddy was a disgrace&#160;<br/>
an‘ that nigger oughta hang from the water-tank!”<br/>
I drew a bead on him, remembered what Atticus had said, then dropped my fists&#160;<br/>
and walked away, “Scout’s a cow—ward!” ringing in my ears. It was the first&#160;<br/>
time I ever walked away from a fight.<br/>
Somehow, if I fought Cecil I would let Atticus down. Atticus so rarely asked Jem&#160;<br/>
and me to do something for him, I could take being called a coward for him. I felt&#160;<br/>
extremely noble for having remembered, and remained noble for three weeks.&#160;<br/>
Then Christmas came and disaster struck.<br/>
Jem and I viewed Christmas with mixed feelings. The good side was the tree and&#160;<br/>
Uncle Jack Finch. Every Christmas Eve day we met Uncle Jack at Maycomb&#160;<br/>
Junction, and he would spend a week with us.<br/>
A flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of Aunt Alexandra&#160;<br/>
and Francis.<br/>
I suppose I should include Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Alexandra’s husband, but as he&#160;<br/>
never spoke a word to me in my life except to say, “Get off the fence,” once, I&#160;<br/>
never saw any reason to take notice of him. Neither did Aunt Alexandra. Long&#160;<br/>
ago, in a burst of friendliness, Aunty and Uncle Jimmy produced a son named&#160;<br/>
Henry, who left home as soon as was humanly possible, married, and produced&#160;<br/>
Francis. Henry and his wife deposited Francis at his grandparents’ every&#160;<br/>
Christmas, then pursued their own pleasures.<br/>
No amount of sighing could induce Atticus to let us spend Christmas day at home.&#160;<br/>
We went to Finch’s Landing every Christmas in my memory. The fact that Aunty&#160;<br/>
was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=80></a>holiday with Francis Hancock. He was a year older than I, and I avoided him on&#160;<br/>
principle: he enjoyed everything I disapproved of, and disliked my ingenuous&#160;<br/>
diversions.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was Atticus’s sister, but when Jem told me about changelings and&#160;<br/>
siblings, I decided that she had been swapped at birth, that my grandparents had&#160;<br/>
perhaps received a Crawford instead of a Finch. Had I ever harbored the mystical&#160;<br/>
notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges, Aunt Alexandra&#160;<br/>
would have been analogous to Mount Everest: throughout my early life, she was&#160;<br/>
cold and there.<br/>
When Uncle Jack jumped down from the train Christmas Eve day, we had to wait&#160;<br/>
for the porter to hand him two long packages. Jem and I always thought it funny&#160;<br/>
when Uncle Jack pecked Atticus on the cheek; they were the only two men we&#160;<br/>
ever saw kiss each other. Uncle Jack shook hands with Jem and swung me high,&#160;<br/>
but not high enough: Uncle Jack was a head shorter than Atticus; the baby of the&#160;<br/>
family, he was younger than Aunt Alexandra. He and Aunty looked alike, but&#160;<br/>
Uncle Jack made better use of his face: we were never wary of his sharp nose and&#160;<br/>
chin.<br/>
He was one of the few men of science who never terrified me, probably because&#160;<br/>
he never behaved like a doctor. Whenever he performed a minor service for Jem&#160;<br/>
and me, as removing a splinter from a foot, he would tell us exactly what he was&#160;<br/>
going to do, give us an estimation of how much it would hurt, and explain the use&#160;<br/>
of any tongs he employed. One Christmas I lurked in corners nursing a twisted&#160;<br/>
splinter in my foot, permitting no one to come near me. When Uncle Jack caught&#160;<br/>
me, he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much&#160;<br/>
that every day he stood at his gate in his dressing-gown, smoking a hookah and&#160;<br/>
delivering five-minute sermons to any passers-by who desired spiritual comfort. I&#160;<br/>
interrupted to make Uncle Jack let me know when he would pull it out, but he&#160;<br/>
held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while I was&#160;<br/>
laughing, that was what was known as relativity.<br/>
“What’s in those packages?” I asked him, pointing to the long thin parcels the&#160;<br/>
porter had given him.<br/>
“None of your business,” he said.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=81></a>Jem said, “How’s Rose Aylmer?”<br/>
Rose Aylmer was Uncle Jack’s cat. She was a beautiful yellow female Uncle Jack&#160;<br/>
said was one of the few women he could stand permanently. He reached into his&#160;<br/>
coat pocket and brought out some snapshots. We admired them.<br/>
“She’s gettin‘ fat,” I said.<br/>
“I should think so. She eats all the leftover fingers and ears from the hospital.”<br/>
“Aw, that’s a damn story,” I said.<br/>
“I beg your pardon?”<br/>
Atticus said, “Don’t pay any attention to her, Jack. She’s trying you out. Cal says&#160;<br/>
she’s been cussing fluently for a week, now.” Uncle Jack raised his eyebrows and&#160;<br/>
said nothing. I was proceeding on the dim theory, aside from the innate&#160;<br/>
attractiveness of such words, that if Atticus discovered I had picked them up at&#160;<br/>
school he wouldn’t make me go.<br/>
But at supper that evening when I asked him to pass the damn ham, please, Uncle&#160;<br/>
Jack pointed at me. “See me afterwards, young lady,” he said.<br/>
When supper was over, Uncle Jack went to the livingroom and sat down. He&#160;<br/>
slapped his thighs for me to come sit on his lap. I liked to smell him: he was like a&#160;<br/>
bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet. He pushed back my bangs and&#160;<br/>
looked at me. “You’re more like Atticus than your mother,” he said. “You’re also&#160;<br/>
growing out of your pants a little.”<br/>
“I reckon they fit all right.”<br/>
“You like words like damn and hell now, don’t you?”<br/>
I said I reckoned so.<br/>
“Well I don’t,” said Uncle Jack, “not unless there’s extreme provocation&#160;<br/>
connected with ‘em. I’ll be here a week, and I don’t want to hear any words like&#160;<br/>
that while I’m here. Scout, you’ll get in trouble if you go around saying things&#160;<br/>
like that. You want to grow up to be a lady, don’t you?”<br/>
I said not particularly.<br/>
“Of course you do. Now let’s get to the tree.”<br/>
We decorated the tree until bedtime, and that night I dreamed of the two long&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=82></a>packages for Jem and me. Next morning Jem and I dived for them: they were&#160;<br/>
from Atticus, who had written Uncle Jack to get them for us, and they were what&#160;<br/>
we had asked for.<br/>
“Don’t point them in the house,” said Atticus, when Jem aimed at a picture on the&#160;<br/>
wall.<br/>
“You’ll have to teach ‘em to shoot,” said Uncle Jack.<br/>
“That’s your job,” said Atticus. “I merely bowed to the inevitable.”<br/>
It took Atticus’s courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree. He declined to let&#160;<br/>
us take our air rifles to the Landing (I had already begun to think of shooting&#160;<br/>
Francis) and said if we made one false move he’d take them away from us for&#160;<br/>
good.<br/>
Finch’s Landing consisted of three hundred and sixty-six steps down a high bluff&#160;<br/>
and ending in a jetty. Farther down stream, beyond the bluff, were traces of an old&#160;<br/>
cotton landing, where Finch Negroes had loaded bales and produce, unloaded&#160;<br/>
blocks of ice, flour and sugar, farm equipment, and feminine apparel. A two-rut&#160;<br/>
road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees. At the end of the road&#160;<br/>
was a two-storied white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs. In&#160;<br/>
his old age, our ancestor Simon Finch had built it to please his nagging wife; but&#160;<br/>
with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era ended. The internal&#160;<br/>
arrangements of the Finch house were indicative of Simon’s guilelessness and the&#160;<br/>
absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring.<br/>
There were six bedrooms upstairs, four for the eight female children, one for&#160;<br/>
Welcome Finch, the sole son, and one for visiting relatives. Simple enough; but&#160;<br/>
the daughters’ rooms could be reached only by one staircase, Welcome’s room&#160;<br/>
and the guestroom only by another. The Daughters’ Staircase was in the ground-<br/>
floor bedroom of their parents, so Simon always knew the hours of his daughters’&#160;<br/>
nocturnal comings and goings.<br/>
There was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house, tacked onto it by a&#160;<br/>
wooden catwalk; in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole, used to summon&#160;<br/>
field hands or as a distress signal; a widow’s walk was on the roof, but no widows&#160;<br/>
walked there—from it, Simon oversaw his overseer, watched the river-boats, and&#160;<br/>
gazed into the lives of surrounding landholders.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=83></a>There went with the house the usual legend about the Yankees: one Finch female,&#160;<br/>
recently engaged, donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the&#160;<br/>
neighborhood; she became stuck in the door to the Daughters’ Staircase but was&#160;<br/>
doused with water and finally pushed through. When we arrived at the Landing,&#160;<br/>
Aunt Alexandra kissed Uncle Jack, Francis kissed Uncle Jack, Uncle Jimmy&#160;<br/>
shook hands silently with Uncle Jack, Jem and I gave our presents to Francis, who&#160;<br/>
gave us a present. Jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults, leaving me to&#160;<br/>
entertain our cousin. Francis was eight and slicked back his hair.<br/>
“What’d you get for Christmas?” I asked politely.<br/>
“Just what I asked for,” he said. Francis had requested a pair of knee-pants, a red&#160;<br/>
leather booksack, five shirts and an untied bow tie.<br/>
“That’s nice,” I lied. “Jem and me got air rifles, and Jem got a chemistry set—”<br/>
“A toy one, I reckon.”<br/>
“No, a real one. He’s gonna make me some invisible ink, and I’m gonna write to&#160;<br/>
Dill in it.”<br/>
Francis asked what was the use of that.<br/>
“Well, can’t you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it?&#160;<br/>
It’ll drive him nuts.”<br/>
Talking to Francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the&#160;<br/>
ocean. He was the most boring child I ever met. As he lived in Mobile, he could&#160;<br/>
not inform on me to school authorities, but he managed to tell everything he knew&#160;<br/>
to Aunt Alexandra, who in turn unburdened herself to Atticus, who either forgot it&#160;<br/>
or gave me hell, whichever struck his fancy. But the only time I ever heard&#160;<br/>
Atticus speak sharply to anyone was when I once heard him say, “Sister, I do the&#160;<br/>
best I can with them!” It had something to do with my going around in overalls.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly&#160;<br/>
hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she&#160;<br/>
said I wasn’t supposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandra’s&#160;<br/>
vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing&#160;<br/>
the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be&#160;<br/>
a ray of sunshine in my father’s lonely life. I suggested that one could be a ray of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=84></a>sunshine in pants just as well, but Aunty said that one had to behave like a&#160;<br/>
sunbeam, that I was born good but had grown progressively worse every year.&#160;<br/>
She hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge, but when I asked&#160;<br/>
Atticus about it, he said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to&#160;<br/>
go on about my business, he didn’t mind me much the way I was.<br/>
At Christmas dinner, I sat at the little table in the diningroom; Jem and Francis sat&#160;<br/>
with the adults at the dining table. Aunty had continued to isolate me long after&#160;<br/>
Jem and Francis graduated to the big table. I often wondered what she thought I’d&#160;<br/>
do, get up and throw something? I sometimes thought of asking her if she would&#160;<br/>
let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once, I would prove to her how&#160;<br/>
civilized I could be; after all, I ate at home every day with no major mishaps.&#160;<br/>
When I begged Atticus to use his influence, he said he had none—we were&#160;<br/>
guests, and we sat where she told us to sit. He also said Aunt Alexandra didn’t&#160;<br/>
understand girls much, she’d never had one.<br/>
But her cooking made up for everything: three kinds of meat, summer vegetables&#160;<br/>
from her pantry shelves; peach pickles, two kinds of cake and ambrosia&#160;<br/>
constituted a modest Christmas dinner. Afterwards, the adults made for the&#160;<br/>
livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition. Jem lay on the floor, and I went&#160;<br/>
to the back yard. “Put on your coat,” said Atticus dreamily, so I didn’t hear him.<br/>
Francis sat beside me on the back steps. “That was the best yet,” I said.<br/>
“Grandma’s a wonderful cook,” said Francis. “She’s gonna teach me how.”<br/>
“Boys don’t cook.” I giggled at the thought of Jem in an apron.<br/>
“Grandma says all men should learn to cook, that men oughta be careful with&#160;<br/>
their wives and wait on ‘em when they don’t feel good,” said my cousin.<br/>
“I don’t want Dill waitin‘ on me,” I said. “I’d rather wait on him.”<br/>
“Dill?”<br/>
“Yeah. Don’t say anything about it yet, but we’re gonna get married as soon as&#160;<br/>
we’re big enough. He asked me last summer.”<br/>
Francis hooted.<br/>
“What’s the matter with him?” I asked. “Ain’t anything the matter with him.”<br/>
“You mean that little runt Grandma says stays with Miss Rachel every summer?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=85></a>“That’s exactly who I mean.”<br/>
“I know all about him,” said Francis.<br/>
“What about him?”<br/>
“Grandma says he hasn’t got a home—”<br/>
“Has too, he lives in Meridian.”<br/>
“—he just gets passed around from relative to relative, and Miss Rachel keeps&#160;<br/>
him every summer.”<br/>
“Francis, that’s not so!”<br/>
Francis grinned at me. “You’re mighty dumb sometimes, Jean Louise. Guess you&#160;<br/>
don’t know any better, though.”<br/>
“What do you mean?”<br/>
“If Uncle Atticus lets you run around with stray dogs, that’s his own business,&#160;<br/>
like Grandma says, so it ain’t your fault. I guess it ain’t your fault if Uncle Atticus&#160;<br/>
is a nigger-lover besides, but I’m here to tell you it certainly does mortify the rest&#160;<br/>
of the family—”<br/>
“Francis, what the hell do you mean?”<br/>
“Just what I said. Grandma says it’s bad enough he lets you all run wild, but now&#160;<br/>
he’s turned out a nigger-lover we’ll never be able to walk the streets of Maycomb&#160;<br/>
agin. He’s ruinin‘ the family, that’s what he’s doin’.”<br/>
Francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen. At a safe distance&#160;<br/>
he called, “He’s nothin‘ but a nigger-lover!”<br/>
“He is not!” I roared. “I don’t know what you’re talkin‘ about, but you better cut&#160;<br/>
it out this red hot minute!”<br/>
I leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk. It was easy to collar Francis. I&#160;<br/>
said take it back quick.<br/>
Francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen. “Nigger-lover!” he yelled.<br/>
When stalking one’s prey, it is best to take one’s time. Say nothing, and as sure as&#160;<br/>
eggs he will become curious and emerge. Francis appeared at the kitchen door.&#160;<br/>
“You still mad, Jean Louise?” he asked tentatively.<br/>
“Nothing to speak of,” I said.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=86></a>Francis came out on the catwalk.<br/>
“You gonna take it back, Fra—ancis?” But I was too quick on the draw. Francis&#160;<br/>
shot back into the kitchen, so I retired to the steps. I could wait patiently. I had sat&#160;<br/>
there perhaps five minutes when I heard Aunt Alexandra speak: “Where’s&#160;<br/>
Francis?”<br/>
“He’s out yonder in the kitchen.”<br/>
“He knows he’s not supposed to play in there.”<br/>
Francis came to the door and yelled, “Grandma, she’s got me in here and she&#160;<br/>
won’t let me out!”<br/>
“What is all this, Jean Louise?”<br/>
I looked up at Aunt Alexandra. “I haven’t got him in there, Aunty, I ain’t holdin‘&#160;<br/>
him.”<br/>
“Yes she is,” shouted Francis, “she won’t let me out!”<br/>
“Have you all been fussing?”<br/>
“Jean Louise got mad at me, Grandma,” called Francis.<br/>
“Francis, come out of there! Jean Louise, if I hear another word out of you I’ll tell&#160;<br/>
your father. Did I hear you say hell a while ago?”<br/>
“Nome.”<br/>
“I thought I did. I’d better not hear it again.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was a back-porch listener. The moment she was out of sight&#160;<br/>
Francis came out head up and grinning. “Don’t you fool with me,” he said.<br/>
He jumped into the yard and kept his distance, kicking tufts of grass, turning&#160;<br/>
around occasionally to smile at me. Jem appeared on the porch, looked at us, and&#160;<br/>
went away. Francis climbed the mimosa tree, came down, put his hands in his&#160;<br/>
pockets and strolled around the yard. “Hah!” he said. I asked him who he thought&#160;<br/>
he was, Uncle Jack? Francis said he reckoned I got told, for me to just sit there&#160;<br/>
and leave him alone.<br/>
“I ain’t botherin‘ you,” I said.<br/>
Francis looked at me carefully, concluded that I had been sufficiently subdued,&#160;<br/>
and crooned softly, “Nigger-lover…”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=87></a>This time, I split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. My left impaired, I&#160;<br/>
sailed in with my right, but not for long. Uncle Jack pinned my arms to my sides&#160;<br/>
and said, “Stand still!”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra ministered to Francis, wiping his tears away with her&#160;<br/>
handkerchief, rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. Atticus, Jem, and Uncle Jimmy&#160;<br/>
had come to the back porch when Francis started yelling.<br/>
“Who started this?” said Uncle Jack.<br/>
Francis and I pointed at each other. “Grandma,” he bawled, “she called me a&#160;<br/>
whore-lady and jumped on me!”<br/>
“Is that true, Scout?” said Uncle Jack.<br/>
“I reckon so.”<br/>
When Uncle Jack looked down at me, his features were like Aunt Alexandra’s.&#160;<br/>
“You know I told you you’d get in trouble if you used words like that? I told you,&#160;<br/>
didn’t I?”<br/>
“Yes sir, but—”<br/>
“Well, you’re in trouble now. Stay there.”<br/>
I was debating whether to stand there or run, and tarried in indecision a moment&#160;<br/>
too long: I turned to flee but Uncle Jack was quicker. I found myself suddenly&#160;<br/>
looking at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass.<br/>
“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live! I hate you an‘ despise you an’&#160;<br/>
hope you die tomorrow!” A statement that seemed to encourage Uncle Jack, more&#160;<br/>
than anything. I ran to Atticus for comfort, but he said I had it coming and it was&#160;<br/>
high time we went home. I climbed into the back seat of the car without saying&#160;<br/>
good-bye to anyone, and at home I ran to my room and slammed the door. Jem&#160;<br/>
tried to say something nice, but I wouldn’t let him.<br/>
When I surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks, and I was&#160;<br/>
reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door. I asked who it was;&#160;<br/>
Uncle Jack answered.<br/>
“Go away!”<br/>
Uncle Jack said if I talked like that he’d lick me again, so I was quiet. When he&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=88></a>entered the room I retreated to a corner and turned my back on him. “Scout,” he&#160;<br/>
said, “do you still hate me?”<br/>
“Go on, please sir.”<br/>
“Why, I didn’t think you’d hold it against me,” he said. “I’m disappointed in you<br/>
—you had that coming and you know it.”<br/>
“Didn’t either.”<br/>
“Honey, you can’t go around calling people—”<br/>
“You ain’t fair,” I said, “you ain’t fair.”<br/>
Uncle Jack’s eyebrows went up. “Not fair? How not?”<br/>
“You’re real nice, Uncle Jack, an‘ I reckon I love you even after what you did, but&#160;<br/>
you don’t understand children much.”<br/>
Uncle Jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me. “And why do I not&#160;<br/>
understand children, Miss Jean Louise? Such conduct as yours required little&#160;<br/>
understanding. It was obstreperous, disorderly and abusive—”<br/>
“You gonna give me a chance to tell you? I don’t mean to sass you, I’m just tryin‘&#160;<br/>
to tell you.”<br/>
Uncle Jack sat down on the bed. His eyebrows came together, and he peered up at&#160;<br/>
me from under them. “Proceed,” he said.<br/>
I took a deep breath. “Well, in the first place you never stopped to gimme a&#160;<br/>
chance to tell you my side of it—you just lit right into me. When Jem an‘ I fuss&#160;<br/>
Atticus doesn’t ever just listen to Jem’s side of it, he hears mine too, an’ in the&#160;<br/>
second place you told me never to use words like that except in ex-extreme&#160;<br/>
provocation, and Francis provocated me enough to knock his block off—”<br/>
Uncle Jack scratched his head. “What was your side of it, Scout?”<br/>
“Francis called Atticus somethin‘, an’ I wasn’t about to take it off him.”<br/>
“What did Francis call him?”<br/>
“A nigger-lover. I ain’t very sure what it means, but the way Francis said it—tell&#160;<br/>
you one thing right now, Uncle Jack, I’ll be—I swear before God if I’ll sit there&#160;<br/>
and let him say somethin‘ about Atticus.”<br/>
“He called Atticus that?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=89></a>“Yes sir, he did, an‘ a lot more. Said Atticus’d be the ruination of the family an’&#160;<br/>
he let Jem an me run wild…”<br/>
From the look on Uncle Jack’s face, I thought I was in for it again. When he said,&#160;<br/>
“We’ll see about this,” I knew Francis was in for it. “I’ve a good mind to go out&#160;<br/>
there tonight.”<br/>
“Please sir, just let it go. Please.”<br/>
“I’ve no intention of letting it go,” he said. “Alexandra should know about this.&#160;<br/>
The idea of—wait’ll I get my hands on that boy…”<br/>
“Uncle Jack, please promise me somethin‘, please sir. Promise you won’t tell&#160;<br/>
Atticus about this. He—he asked me one time not to let anything I heard about&#160;<br/>
him make me mad, an’ I’d ruther him think we were fightin‘ about somethin’ else&#160;<br/>
instead. Please promise…”<br/>
“But I don’t like Francis getting away with something like that—”<br/>
“He didn’t. You reckon you could tie up my hand? It’s still bleedin‘ some.”<br/>
“Of course I will, baby. I know of no hand I would be more delighted to tie up.&#160;<br/>
Will you come this way?”<br/>
Uncle Jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom. While he cleaned and bandaged&#160;<br/>
my knuckles, he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old&#160;<br/>
gentleman who had a cat named Hodge, and who counted all the cracks in the&#160;<br/>
sidewalk when he went to town. “There now,” he said. “You’ll have a very&#160;<br/>
unladylike scar on your wedding-ring finger.”<br/>
“Thank you sir. Uncle Jack?”<br/>
“Ma’am?”<br/>
“What’s a whore-lady?”<br/>
Uncle Jack plunged into another long tale about an old Prime Minister who sat in&#160;<br/>
the House of Commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there&#160;<br/>
when all about him men were losing their heads. I guess he was trying to answer&#160;<br/>
my question, but he made no sense whatsoever.<br/>
Later, when I was supposed to be in bed, I went down the hall for a drink of water&#160;<br/>
and heard Atticus and Uncle Jack in the livingroom:<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=90></a>“I shall never marry, Atticus.”<br/>
“Why?”<br/>
“I might have children.”<br/>
Atticus said, “You’ve a lot to learn, Jack.”<br/>
“I know. Your daughter gave me my first lessons this afternoon. She said I didn’t&#160;<br/>
understand children much and told me why. She was quite right. Atticus, she told&#160;<br/>
me how I should have treated her—oh dear, I’m so sorry I romped on her.”<br/>
Atticus chuckled. “She earned it, so don’t feel too remorseful.”<br/>
I waited, on tenterhooks, for Uncle Jack to tell Atticus my side of it. But he&#160;<br/>
didn’t. He simply murmured, “Her use of bathroom invective leaves nothing to&#160;<br/>
the imagination. But she doesn’t know the meaning of half she says—she asked&#160;<br/>
me what a whore-lady was…”<br/>
“Did you tell her?”<br/>
“No, I told her about Lord Melbourne.”<br/>
“Jack! When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness’ sake. But&#160;<br/>
don’t make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion&#160;<br/>
quicker than adults, and evasion simply muddles ‘em. No,” my father mused,&#160;<br/>
“you had the right answer this afternoon, but the wrong reasons. Bad language is&#160;<br/>
a stage all children go through, and it dies with time when they learn they’re not&#160;<br/>
attracting attention with it. Hotheadedness isn’t. Scout’s got to learn to keep her&#160;<br/>
head and learn soon, with what’s in store for her these next few months. She’s&#160;<br/>
coming along, though. Jem’s getting older and she follows his example a good bit&#160;<br/>
now. All she needs is assistance sometimes.”<br/>
“Atticus, you’ve never laid a hand on her.”<br/>
“I admit that. So far I’ve been able to get by with threats. Jack, she minds me as&#160;<br/>
well as she can. Doesn’t come up to scratch half the time, but she tries.”<br/>
“That’s not the answer,” said Uncle Jack.<br/>
“No, the answer is she knows I know she tries. That’s what makes the difference.&#160;<br/>
What bothers me is that she and Jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty&#160;<br/>
soon. I’m not worried about Jem keeping his head, but Scout’d just as soon jump&#160;<br/>
on someone as look at him if her pride’s at stake…”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=91></a>I waited for Uncle Jack to break his promise. He still didn’t.<br/>
“Atticus, how bad is this going to be? You haven’t had too much chance to&#160;<br/>
discuss it.”<br/>
“It couldn’t be worse, Jack. The only thing we’ve got is a black man’s word&#160;<br/>
against the Ewells‘. The evidence boils down to you-did—I-didn’t. The jury&#160;<br/>
couldn’t possibly be expected to take Tom Robinson’s word against the Ewells’—<br/>
are you acquainted with the Ewells?”<br/>
Uncle Jack said yes, he remembered them. He described them to Atticus, but&#160;<br/>
Atticus said, “You’re a generation off. The present ones are the same, though.”<br/>
“What are you going to do, then?”<br/>
“Before I’m through, I intend to jar the jury a bit—I think we’ll have a reasonable&#160;<br/>
chance on appeal, though. I really can’t tell at this stage, Jack. You know, I’d&#160;<br/>
hoped to get through life without a case of this kind, but John Taylor pointed at&#160;<br/>
me and said, ‘You’re It.’”<br/>
“Let this cup pass from you, eh?”<br/>
“Right. But do you think I could face my children otherwise? You know what’s&#160;<br/>
going to happen as well as I do, Jack, and I hope and pray I can get Jem and Scout&#160;<br/>
through it without bitterness, and most of all, without catching Maycomb’s usual&#160;<br/>
disease. Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a&#160;<br/>
Negro comes up, is something I don’t pretend to understand… I just hope that&#160;<br/>
Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town. I&#160;<br/>
hope they trust me enough… Jean Louise?”<br/>
My scalp jumped. I stuck my head around the corner. “Sir?”<br/>
“Go to bed.”<br/>
I scurried to my room and went to bed. Uncle Jack was a prince of a fellow not to&#160;<br/>
let me down. But I never figured out how Atticus knew I was listening, and it was&#160;<br/>
not until many years later that I realized he wanted me to hear every word he said.<br/>

<b>Chapter 10</b><br/>
Atticus was feeble: he was nearly fifty. When Jem and I asked him why he was so&#160;<br/>
old, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and&#160;<br/>
manliness. He was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries, and&#160;<br/>
there was nothing Jem or I could say about him when our classmates said, “My&#160;<br/>
father—”<br/>
Jem was football crazy. Atticus was never too tired to play keep-away, but when&#160;<br/>
Jem wanted to tackle him Atticus would say, “I’m too old for that, son.”<br/>
Our father didn’t do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus&#160;<br/>
did not drive a dump-truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm,&#160;<br/>
work in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of&#160;<br/>
anyone.<br/>
Besides that, he wore glasses. He was nearly blind in his left eye, and said left&#160;<br/>
eyes were the tribal curse of the Finches. Whenever he wanted to see something&#160;<br/>
well, he turned his head and looked from his right eye.<br/>
He did not do the things our schoolmates’ fathers did: he never went hunting, he&#160;<br/>
did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke. He sat in the livingroom and read.<br/>
With these attributes, however, he would not remain as inconspicuous as we&#160;<br/>
wished him to: that year, the school buzzed with talk about him defending Tom&#160;<br/>
Robinson, none of which was complimentary. After my bout with Cecil Jacobs&#160;<br/>
when I committed myself to a policy of cowardice, word got around that Scout&#160;<br/>
Finch wouldn’t fight any more, her daddy wouldn’t let her. This was not entirely&#160;<br/>
correct: I wouldn’t fight publicly for Atticus, but the family was private ground. I&#160;<br/>
would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail. Francis Hancock,&#160;<br/>
for example, knew that.<br/>
When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldn’t teach us to shoot. Uncle Jack&#160;<br/>
instructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasn’t interested in guns.&#160;<br/>
Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=93></a>know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but&#160;<br/>
remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”<br/>
That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I&#160;<br/>
asked Miss Maudie about it.<br/>
“Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music&#160;<br/>
for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they&#160;<br/>
don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a&#160;<br/>
mockingbird.”<br/>
“Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, ain’t it?”<br/>
“Been here longer than the town.”<br/>
“Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and me’s the only children&#160;<br/>
around here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachel’s old and so&#160;<br/>
are you and Atticus.”<br/>
“I don’t call fifty very old,” said Miss Maudie tartly. “Not being wheeled around&#160;<br/>
yet, am I? Neither’s your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to&#160;<br/>
burn down that old mausoleum of mine, I’m too old to keep it up—maybe you’re&#160;<br/>
right, Jean Louise, this is a settled neighborhood. You’ve never been around&#160;<br/>
young folks much, have you?”<br/>
“Yessum, at school.”<br/>
“I mean young grown-ups. You’re lucky, you know. You and Jem have the&#160;<br/>
benefit of your father’s age. If your father was thirty you’d find life quite&#160;<br/>
different.”<br/>
“I sure would. Atticus can’t do anything…”<br/>
“You’d be surprised,” said Miss Maudie. “There’s life in him yet.”<br/>
“What can he do?”<br/>
“Well, he can make somebody’s will so airtight can’t anybody meddle with it.”<br/>
“Shoot…”<br/>
“Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the&#160;<br/>
Landing when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both&#160;<br/>
sides of the river.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=94></a>“Good Lord, Miss Maudie, Jem and me beat him all the time.”<br/>
“It’s about time you found out it’s because he lets you. Did you know he can play&#160;<br/>
a Jew’s Harp?”<br/>
This modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him.<br/>
“Well…” she said.<br/>
“Well, what, Miss Maudie?”<br/>
“Well nothing. Nothing—it seems with all that you’d be proud of him. Can’t&#160;<br/>
everybody play a Jew’s Harp. Now keep out of the way of the carpenters. You’d&#160;<br/>
better go home, I’ll be in my azaleas and can’t watch you. Plank might hit you.”<br/>
I went to the back yard and found Jem plugging away at a tin can, which seemed&#160;<br/>
stupid with all the bluejays around. I returned to the front yard and busied myself&#160;<br/>
for two hours erecting a complicated breastworks at the side of the porch,&#160;<br/>
consisting of a tire, an orange crate, the laundry hamper, the porch chairs, and a&#160;<br/>
small U.S. flag Jem gave me from a popcorn box.<br/>
When Atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across&#160;<br/>
the street. “What are you shooting at?”<br/>
“Miss Maudie’s rear end.”<br/>
Atticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bushes. He pushed&#160;<br/>
his hat to the back of his head and crossed the street. “Maudie,” he called, “I&#160;<br/>
thought I’d better warn you. You’re in considerable peril.”<br/>
Miss Maudie straightened up and looked toward me. She said, “Atticus, you are a&#160;<br/>
devil from hell.”<br/>
When Atticus returned he told me to break camp. “Don’t you ever let me catch&#160;<br/>
you pointing that gun at anybody again,” he said.<br/>
I wished my father was a devil from hell. I sounded out Calpurnia on the subject.&#160;<br/>
“Mr. Finch? Why, he can do lots of things.”<br/>
“Like what?” I asked.<br/>
Calpurnia scratched her head. “Well, I don’t rightly know,” she said.<br/>
Jem underlined it when he asked Atticus if he was going out for the Methodists&#160;<br/>
and Atticus said he’d break his neck if he did, he was just too old for that sort of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=95></a>thing. The Methodists were trying to pay off their church mortgage, and had&#160;<br/>
challenged the Baptists to a game of touch football. Everybody in town’s father&#160;<br/>
was playing, it seemed, except Atticus. Jem said he didn’t even want to go, but he&#160;<br/>
was unable to resist football in any form, and he stood gloomily on the sidelines&#160;<br/>
with Atticus and me watching Cecil Jacobs’s father make touchdowns for the&#160;<br/>
Baptists.<br/>
One Saturday Jem and I decided to go exploring with our air-rifles to see if we&#160;<br/>
could find a rabbit or a squirrel. We had gone about five hundred yards beyond&#160;<br/>
the Radley Place when I noticed Jem squinting at something down the street. He&#160;<br/>
had turned his head to one side and was looking out of the corners of his eyes.<br/>
“Whatcha looking at?”<br/>
“That old dog down yonder,” he said.<br/>
“That’s old Tim Johnson, ain’t it?”<br/>
“Yeah.”<br/>
Tim Johnson was the property of Mr. Harry Johnson who drove the Mobile bus&#160;<br/>
and lived on the southern edge of town. Tim was a liver-colored bird dog, the pet&#160;<br/>
of Maycomb.<br/>
“What’s he doing?”<br/>
“I don’t know, Scout. We better go home.”<br/>
“Aw Jem, it’s February.”<br/>
“I don’t care, I’m gonna tell Cal.”<br/>
We raced home and ran to the kitchen.<br/>
“Cal,” said Jem, “can you come down the sidewalk a minute?”<br/>
“What for, Jem? I can’t come down the sidewalk every time you want me.”<br/>
“There’s somethin‘ wrong with an old dog down yonder.”<br/>
Calpurnia sighed. “I can’t wrap up any dog’s foot now. There’s some gauze in the&#160;<br/>
bathroom, go get it and do it yourself.”<br/>
Jem shook his head. “He’s sick, Cal. Something’s wrong with him.”<br/>
“What’s he doin‘, trying to catch his tail?”<br/>
“No, he’s doin‘ like this.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=96></a>Jem gulped like a goldfish, hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso. “He’s&#160;<br/>
goin‘ like that, only not like he means to.”<br/>
“Are you telling me a story, Jem Finch?” Calpurnia’s voice hardened.<br/>
“No Cal, I swear I’m not.”<br/>
“Was he runnin‘?”<br/>
“No, he’s just moseyin‘ along, so slow you can’t hardly tell it. He’s comin’ this&#160;<br/>
way.”<br/>
Calpurnia rinsed her hands and followed Jem into the yard. “I don’t see any dog,”&#160;<br/>
she said.<br/>
She followed us beyond the Radley Place and looked where Jem pointed. Tim&#160;<br/>
Johnson was not much more than a speck in the distance, but he was closer to us.&#160;<br/>
He walked erratically, as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs. He&#160;<br/>
reminded me of a car stuck in a sandbed.<br/>
“He’s gone lopsided,” said Jem.<br/>
Calpurnia stared, then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home. She shut the&#160;<br/>
wood door behind us, went to the telephone and shouted, “Gimme Mr. Finch’s&#160;<br/>
office!”<br/>
“Mr. Finch!” she shouted. “This is Cal. I swear to God there’s a mad dog down&#160;<br/>
the street a piece—he’s comin‘ this way, yes sir, he’s—Mr. Finch, I declare he is<br/>
—old Tim Johnson, yes sir… yessir… yes—”<br/>
She hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what Atticus had said.&#160;<br/>
She rattled the telephone hook and said, “Miss Eula May—now ma’am, I’m&#160;<br/>
through talkin‘ to Mr. Finch, please don’t connect me no more—listen, Miss Eula&#160;<br/>
May, can you call Miss Rachel and Miss Stephanie Crawford and whoever’s got a&#160;<br/>
phone on this street and tell ’em a mad dog’s comin‘? Please ma’am!”<br/>
Calpurnia listened. “I know it’s February, Miss Eula May, but I know a mad dog&#160;<br/>
when I see one. Please ma’am hurry!”<br/>
Calpurnia asked Jem, “Radleys got a phone?”<br/>
Jem looked in the book and said no. “They won’t come out anyway, Cal.”<br/>
“I don’t care, I’m gonna tell ‘em.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=97></a>She ran to the front porch, Jem and I at her heels. “You stay in that house!” she&#160;<br/>
yelled.<br/>
Calpurnia’s message had been received by the neighborhood. Every wood door&#160;<br/>
within our range of vision was closed tight. We saw no trace of Tim Johnson. We&#160;<br/>
watched Calpurnia running toward the Radley Place, holding her skirt and apron&#160;<br/>
above her knees. She went up to the front steps and banged on the door. She got&#160;<br/>
no answer, and she shouted, “Mr. Nathan, Mr. Arthur, mad dog’s comin‘! Mad&#160;<br/>
dog’s comin’!”<br/>
“She’s supposed to go around in back,” I said.<br/>
Jem shook his head. “Don’t make any difference now,” he said.<br/>
Calpurnia pounded on the door in vain. No one acknowledged her warning; no&#160;<br/>
one seemed to have heard it.<br/>
As Calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black Ford swung into the driveway.&#160;<br/>
Atticus and Mr. Heck Tate got out.<br/>
Mr. Heck Tate was the sheriff of Maycomb County. He was as tall as Atticus, but&#160;<br/>
thinner. He was long-nosed, wore boots with shiny metal eye-holes, boot pants&#160;<br/>
and a lumber jacket. His belt had a row of bullets sticking in it. He carried a heavy&#160;<br/>
rifle. When he and Atticus reached the porch, Jem opened the door.<br/>
“Stay inside, son,” said Atticus. “Where is he, Cal?”<br/>
“He oughta be here by now,” said Calpurnia, pointing down the street.<br/>
“Not runnin‘, is he?” asked Mr. Tate.<br/>
“Naw sir, he’s in the twitchin‘ stage, Mr. Heck.”<br/>
“Should we go after him, Heck?” asked Atticus.<br/>
“We better wait, Mr. Finch. They usually go in a straight line, but you never can&#160;<br/>
tell. He might follow the curve—hope he does or he’ll go straight in the Radley&#160;<br/>
back yard. Let’s wait a minute.”<br/>
“Don’t think he’ll get in the Radley yard,” said Atticus. “Fence’ll stop him. He’ll&#160;<br/>
probably follow the road…”<br/>
I thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth, galloped, leaped and lunged at throats,&#160;<br/>
and I thought they did it in August. Had Tim Johnson behaved thus, I would have&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=98></a>been less frightened.<br/>
Nothing is more deadly than a deserted, waiting street. The trees were still, the&#160;<br/>
mockingbirds were silent, the carpenters at Miss Maudie’s house had vanished. I&#160;<br/>
heard Mr. Tate sniff, then blow his nose. I saw him shift his gun to the crook of&#160;<br/>
his arm. I saw Miss Stephanie Crawford’s face framed in the glass window of her&#160;<br/>
front door. Miss Maudie appeared and stood beside her. Atticus put his foot on&#160;<br/>
the rung of a chair and rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh.<br/>
“There he is,” he said softly.<br/>
Tim Johnson came into sight, walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve&#160;<br/>
parallel to the Radley house.<br/>
“Look at him,” whispered Jem. “Mr. Heck said they walked in a straight line. He&#160;<br/>
can’t even stay in the road.”<br/>
“He looks more sick than anything,” I said.<br/>
“Let anything get in front of him and he’ll come straight at it.”<br/>
Mr. Tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward. “He’s got it all right,&#160;<br/>
Mr. Finch.”<br/>
Tim Johnson was advancing at a snail’s pace, but he was not playing or sniffing at&#160;<br/>
foliage: he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force&#160;<br/>
that was inching him toward us. We could see him shiver like a horse shedding&#160;<br/>
flies; his jaw opened and shut; he was alist, but he was being pulled gradually&#160;<br/>
toward us.<br/>
“He’s lookin‘ for a place to die,” said Jem.<br/>
Mr. Tate turned around. “He’s far from dead, Jem, he hasn’t got started yet.”<br/>
Tim Johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the Radley Place, and&#160;<br/>
what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road&#160;<br/>
he would take. He made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the Radley&#160;<br/>
gate; then he tried to turn around, but was having difficulty.<br/>
Atticus said, “He’s within range, Heck. You better get him before he goes down&#160;<br/>
the side street—Lord knows who’s around the corner. Go inside, Cal.”<br/>
Calpurnia opened the screen door, latched it behind her, then unlatched it and held&#160;<br/>
onto the hook. She tried to block Jem and me with her body, but we looked out&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=99></a>from beneath her arms.<br/>
“Take him, Mr. Finch.” Mr. Tate handed the rifle to Atticus; Jem and I nearly&#160;<br/>
fainted.<br/>
“Don’t waste time, Heck,” said Atticus. “Go on.”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, this is a one-shot job.”<br/>
Atticus shook his head vehemently: “Don’t just stand there, Heck! He won’t wait&#160;<br/>
all day for you—”<br/>
“For God’s sake, Mr. Finch, look where he is! Miss and you’ll go straight into the&#160;<br/>
Radley house! I can’t shoot that well and you know it!”<br/>
“I haven’t shot a gun in thirty years—”<br/>
Mr. Tate almost threw the rifle at Atticus. “I’d feel mighty comfortable if you did&#160;<br/>
now,” he said.<br/>
In a fog, Jem and I watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle&#160;<br/>
of the street. He walked quickly, but I thought he moved like an underwater&#160;<br/>
swimmer: time had slowed to a nauseating crawl.<br/>
When Atticus raised his glasses Calpurnia murmured, “Sweet Jesus help him,”&#160;<br/>
and put her hands to her cheeks.<br/>
Atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead; they slipped down, and he dropped&#160;<br/>
them in the street. In the silence, I heard them crack. Atticus rubbed his eyes and&#160;<br/>
chin; we saw him blink hard.<br/>
In front of the Radley gate, Tim Johnson had made up what was left of his mind.&#160;<br/>
He had finally turned himself around, to pursue his original course up our street.&#160;<br/>
He made two steps forward, then stopped and raised his head. We saw his body&#160;<br/>
go rigid.<br/>
With movements so swift they seemed simultaneous, Atticus’s hand yanked a ball-<br/>
tipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder.<br/>
The rifle cracked. Tim Johnson leaped, flopped over and crumpled on the&#160;<br/>
sidewalk in a brown-and-white heap. He didn’t know what hit him.<br/>
Mr. Tate jumped off the porch and ran to the Radley Place. He stopped in front of&#160;<br/>
the dog, squatted, turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=100></a>left eye. “You were a little to the right, Mr. Finch,” he called.<br/>
“Always was,” answered Atticus. “If I had my ‘druthers I’d take a shotgun.”<br/>
He stooped and picked up his glasses, ground the broken lenses to powder under&#160;<br/>
his heel, and went to Mr. Tate and stood looking down at Tim Johnson.<br/>
Doors opened one by one, and the neighborhood slowly came alive. Miss Maudie&#160;<br/>
walked down the steps with Miss Stephanie Crawford.<br/>
Jem was paralyzed. I pinched him to get him moving, but when Atticus saw us&#160;<br/>
coming he called, “Stay where you are.”<br/>
When Mr. Tate and Atticus returned to the yard, Mr. Tate was smiling. “I’ll have&#160;<br/>
Zeebo collect him,” he said. “You haven’t forgot much, Mr. Finch. They say it&#160;<br/>
never leaves you.”<br/>
Atticus was silent.<br/>
“Atticus?” said Jem.<br/>
“Yes?”<br/>
“Nothin‘.”<br/>
“I saw that, One-Shot Finch!”<br/>
Atticus wheeled around and faced Miss Maudie. They looked at one another&#160;<br/>
without saying anything, and Atticus got into the sheriff’s car. “Come here,” he&#160;<br/>
said to Jem. “Don’t you go near that dog, you understand? Don’t go near him,&#160;<br/>
he’s just as dangerous dead as alive.”<br/>
“Yes sir,” said Jem. “Atticus—”<br/>
“What, son?”<br/>
“Nothing.”<br/>
“What’s the matter with you, boy, can’t you talk?” said Mr. Tate, grinning at Jem.&#160;<br/>
“Didn’t you know your daddy’s—”<br/>
“Hush, Heck,” said Atticus, “let’s go back to town.”<br/>
When they drove away, Jem and I went to Miss Stephanie’s front steps. We sat&#160;<br/>
waiting for Zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck.<br/>
Jem sat in numb confusion, and Miss Stephanie said, “Uh, uh, uh, who’da thought&#160;<br/>
of a mad dog in February? Maybe he wadn’t mad, maybe he was just crazy. I’d&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=101></a>hate to see Harry Johnson’s face when he gets in from the Mobile run and finds&#160;<br/>
Atticus Finch’s shot his dog. Bet he was just full of fleas from somewhere—”<br/>
Miss Maudie said Miss Stephanie’d be singing a different tune if Tim Johnson&#160;<br/>
was still coming up the street, that they’d find out soon enough, they’d send his&#160;<br/>
head to Montgomery.<br/>
Jem became vaguely articulate: “‘d you see him, Scout? ’d you see him just&#160;<br/>
standin‘ there?… ’n‘ all of a sudden he just relaxed all over, an’ it looked like that&#160;<br/>
gun was a part of him… an‘ he did it so quick, like… I hafta aim for ten minutes&#160;<br/>
’fore I can hit somethin‘…”<br/>
Miss Maudie grinned wickedly. “Well now, Miss Jean Louise,” she said, “still&#160;<br/>
think your father can’t do anything? Still ashamed of him?”<br/>
“Nome,” I said meekly.<br/>
“Forgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the Jew’s Harp, Atticus&#160;<br/>
Finch was the deadest shot in Maycomb County in his time.”<br/>
“Dead shot…” echoed Jem.<br/>
“That’s what I said, Jem Finch. Guess you’ll change your tune now. The very&#160;<br/>
idea, didn’t you know his nickname was Ol‘ One-Shot when he was a boy? Why,&#160;<br/>
down at the Landing when he was coming up, if he shot fifteen times and hit&#160;<br/>
fourteen doves he’d complain about wasting ammunition.”<br/>
“He never said anything about that,” Jem muttered.<br/>
“Never said anything about it, did he?”<br/>
“No ma’am.”<br/>
“Wonder why he never goes huntin‘ now,” I said.<br/>
“Maybe I can tell you,” said Miss Maudie. “If your father’s anything, he’s&#160;<br/>
civilized in his heart. Marksmanship’s a gift of God, a talent—oh, you have to&#160;<br/>
practice to make it perfect, but shootin’s different from playing the piano or the&#160;<br/>
like. I think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that God had given him&#160;<br/>
an unfair advantage over most living things. I guess he decided he wouldn’t shoot&#160;<br/>
till he had to, and he had to today.”<br/>
“Looks like he’d be proud of it,” I said.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=102></a>“People in their right minds never take pride in their talents,” said Miss Maudie.<br/>
We saw Zeebo drive up. He took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck&#160;<br/>
and gingerly lifted Tim Johnson. He pitched the dog onto the truck, then poured&#160;<br/>
something from a gallon jug on and around the spot where Tim fell. “Don’t yawl&#160;<br/>
come over here for a while,” he called.<br/>
When we went home I told Jem we’d really have something to talk about at&#160;<br/>
school on Monday. Jem turned on me.<br/>
“Don’t say anything about it, Scout,” he said.<br/>
“What? I certainly am. Ain’t everybody’s daddy the deadest shot in Maycomb&#160;<br/>
County.”<br/>
Jem said, “I reckon if he’d wanted us to know it, he’da told us. If he was proud of&#160;<br/>
it, he’da told us.”<br/>
“Maybe it just slipped his mind,” I said.<br/>
“Naw, Scout, it’s something you wouldn’t understand. Atticus is real old, but I&#160;<br/>
wouldn’t care if he couldn’t do anything—I wouldn’t care if he couldn’t do a&#160;<br/>
blessed thing.”<br/>
Jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse. Running after it, he&#160;<br/>
called back: “Atticus is a gentleman, just like me!”<br/>

<b>Chapter 11</b><br/>
When we were small, Jem and I confined our activities to the southern&#160;<br/>
neighborhood, but when I was well into the second grade at school and&#160;<br/>
tormenting Boo Radley became passe, the business section of Maycomb drew us&#160;<br/>
frequently up the street past the real property of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. It&#160;<br/>
was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk&#160;<br/>
a mile out of the way. Previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=103></a>for more, but Jem said I had to grow up some time.<br/>
Mrs. Dubose lived alone except for a Negro girl in constant attendance, two doors&#160;<br/>
up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dog-trot hall. She was&#160;<br/>
very old; she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair. It&#160;<br/>
was rumored that she kept a CSA pistol concealed among her numerous shawls&#160;<br/>
and wraps.<br/>
Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we would be raked&#160;<br/>
by her wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior,&#160;<br/>
and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew&#160;<br/>
up, which was always nothing. We had long ago given up the idea of walking past&#160;<br/>
her house on the opposite side of the street; that only made her raise her voice and&#160;<br/>
let the whole neighborhood in on it.<br/>
We could do nothing to please her. If I said as sunnily as I could, “Hey, Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Dubose,” I would receive for an answer, “Don’t you say hey to me, you ugly girl!&#160;<br/>
You say good afternoon, Mrs. Dubose!”<br/>
She was vicious. Once she heard Jem refer to our father as “Atticus” and her&#160;<br/>
reaction was apoplectic. Besides being the sassiest, most disrespectful mutts who&#160;<br/>
ever passed her way, we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not&#160;<br/>
remarried after our mother’s death. A lovelier lady than our mother never lived,&#160;<br/>
she said, and it was heartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild.&#160;<br/>
I did not remember our mother, but Jem did—he would tell me about her&#160;<br/>
sometimes—and he went livid when Mrs. Dubose shot us this message.<br/>
Jem, having survived Boo Radley, a mad dog and other terrors, had concluded&#160;<br/>
that it was cowardly to stop at Miss Rachel’s front steps and wait, and had&#160;<br/>
decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet&#160;<br/>
Atticus coming from work. Countless evenings Atticus would find Jem furious at&#160;<br/>
something Mrs. Dubose had said when we went by.<br/>
“Easy does it, son,” Atticus would say. “She’s an old lady and she’s ill. You just&#160;<br/>
hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, it’s your job&#160;<br/>
not to let her make you mad.” Jem would say she must not be very sick, she&#160;<br/>
hollered so. When the three of us came to her house, Atticus would sweep off his&#160;<br/>
hat, wave gallantly to her and say, “Good evening, Mrs. Dubose! You look like a&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=104></a>picture this evening.”<br/>
I never heard Atticus say like a picture of what. He would tell her the courthouse&#160;<br/>
news, and would say he hoped with all his heart she’d have a good day tomorrow.&#160;<br/>
He would return his hat to his head, swing me to his shoulders in her very&#160;<br/>
presence, and we would go home in the twilight. It was times like these when I&#160;<br/>
thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the&#160;<br/>
bravest man who ever lived.<br/>
The day after Jem’s twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets, so we&#160;<br/>
headed for town in the early afternoon. Jem thought he had enough to buy a&#160;<br/>
miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me.<br/>
I had long had my eye on that baton: it was at V. J. Elmore’s, it was bedecked&#160;<br/>
with sequins and tinsel, it cost seventeen cents. It was then my burning ambition&#160;<br/>
to grow up and twirl with the Maycomb County High School band. Having&#160;<br/>
developed my talent to where I could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming&#160;<br/>
down, I had caused Calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she&#160;<br/>
saw me with a stick in my hand. I felt that I could overcome this defect with a real&#160;<br/>
baton, and I thought it generous of Jem to buy one for me.<br/>
Mrs. Dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by.<br/>
“Where are you two going at this time of day?” she shouted. “Playing hooky, I&#160;<br/>
suppose. I’ll just call up the principal and tell him!” She put her hands on the&#160;<br/>
wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face.<br/>
“Aw, it’s Saturday, Mrs. Dubose,” said Jem.<br/>
“Makes no difference if it’s Saturday,” she said obscurely. “I wonder if your&#160;<br/>
father knows where you are?”<br/>
“Mrs. Dubose, we’ve been goin‘ to town by ourselves since we were this high.”&#160;<br/>
Jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk.<br/>
“Don’t you lie to me!” she yelled. “Jeremy Finch, Maudie Atkinson told me you&#160;<br/>
broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning. She’s going to tell your father&#160;<br/>
and then you’ll wish you never saw the light of day! If you aren’t sent to the&#160;<br/>
reform school before next week, my name’s not Dubose!”<br/>
Jem, who hadn’t been near Miss Maudie’s scuppernong arbor since last summer,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=105></a>and who knew Miss Maudie wouldn’t tell Atticus if he had, issued a general&#160;<br/>
denial.<br/>
“Don’t you contradict me!” Mrs. Dubose bawled. “And you—” she pointed an&#160;<br/>
arthritic finger at me—“what are you doing in those overalls? You should be in a&#160;<br/>
dress and camisole, young lady! You’ll grow up waiting on tables if somebody&#160;<br/>
doesn’t change your ways—a Finch waiting on tables at the O.K. Café—hah!”<br/>
I was terrified. The O.K. Café was a dim organization on the north side of the&#160;<br/>
square. I grabbed Jem’s hand but he shook me loose.<br/>
“Come on, Scout,” he whispered. “Don’t pay any attention to her, just hold your&#160;<br/>
head high and be a gentleman.”<br/>
But Mrs. Dubose held us: “Not only a Finch waiting on tables but one in the&#160;<br/>
courthouse lawing for niggers!”<br/>
Jem stiffened. Mrs. Dubose’s shot had gone home and she knew it:<br/>
“Yes indeed, what has this world come to when a Finch goes against his raising?&#160;<br/>
I’ll tell you!” She put her hand to her mouth. When she drew it away, it trailed a&#160;<br/>
long silver thread of saliva. “Your father’s no better than the niggers and trash he&#160;<br/>
works for!”<br/>
Jem was scarlet. I pulled at his sleeve, and we were followed up the sidewalk by a&#160;<br/>
philippic on our family’s moral degeneration, the major premise of which was&#160;<br/>
that half the Finches were in the asylum anyway, but if our mother were living we&#160;<br/>
would not have come to such a state.<br/>
I wasn’t sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at Mrs. Dubose’s&#160;<br/>
assessment of the family’s mental hygiene. I had become almost accustomed to&#160;<br/>
hearing insults aimed at Atticus. But this was the first one coming from an adult.&#160;<br/>
Except for her remarks about Atticus, Mrs. Dubose’s attack was only routine.&#160;<br/>
There was a hint of summer in the air—in the shadows it was cool, but the sun&#160;<br/>
was warm, which meant good times coming: no school and Dill.<br/>
Jem bought his steam engine and we went by Elmore’s for my baton. Jem took no&#160;<br/>
pleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside&#160;<br/>
me toward home. On the way home I nearly hit Mr. Link Deas, who said, “Look&#160;<br/>
out now, Scout!” when I missed a toss, and when we approached Mrs. Dubose’s&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=106></a>house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times.<br/>
She was not on the porch.<br/>
In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it, what made&#160;<br/>
him break the bonds of “You just be a gentleman, son,” and the phase of self-<br/>
conscious rectitude he had recently entered. Jem had probably stood as much guff&#160;<br/>
about Atticus lawing for niggers as had I, and I took it for granted that he kept his&#160;<br/>
temper—he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time,&#160;<br/>
however, I thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few&#160;<br/>
minutes he simply went mad.<br/>
What Jem did was something I’d do as a matter of course had I not been under&#160;<br/>
Atticus’s interdict, which I assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies. We&#160;<br/>
had just come to her gate when Jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up&#160;<br/>
the steps into Mrs. Dubose’s front yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said,&#160;<br/>
forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls, forgetting that if Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Dubose missed, her girl Jessie probably wouldn’t.<br/>
He did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Dubose owned, until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves. He&#160;<br/>
bent my baton against his knee, snapped it in two and threw it down.<br/>
By that time I was shrieking. Jem yanked my hair, said he didn’t care, he’d do it&#160;<br/>
again if he got a chance, and if I didn’t shut up he’d pull every hair out of my&#160;<br/>
head. I didn’t shut up and he kicked me. I lost my balance and fell on my face.&#160;<br/>
Jem picked me up roughly but looked like he was sorry. There was nothing to say.<br/>
We did not choose to meet Atticus coming home that evening. We skulked&#160;<br/>
around the kitchen until Calpurnia threw us out. By some voo-doo system&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia seemed to know all about it. She was a less than satisfactory source of&#160;<br/>
palliation, but she did give Jem a hot biscuit-and-butter which he tore in half and&#160;<br/>
shared with me. It tasted like cotton.<br/>
We went to the livingroom. I picked up a football magazine, found a picture of&#160;<br/>
Dixie Howell, showed it to Jem and said, “This looks like you.” That was the&#160;<br/>
nicest thing I could think to say to him, but it was no help. He sat by the windows,&#160;<br/>
hunched down in a rocking chair, scowling, waiting. Daylight faded.<br/>
Two geological ages later, we heard the soles of Atticus’s shoes scrape the front&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=107></a>steps. The screen door slammed, there was a pause—Atticus was at the hat rack in&#160;<br/>
the hall—and we heard him call, “Jem!” His voice was like the winter wind.<br/>
Atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found us there, frozen&#160;<br/>
still. He carried my baton in one hand; its filthy yellow tassel trailed on the rug.&#160;<br/>
He held out his other hand; it contained fat camellia buds.<br/>
“Jem,” he said, “are you responsible for this?”<br/>
“Yes sir.”<br/>
“Why’d you do it?”<br/>
Jem said softly, “She said you lawed for niggers and trash.”<br/>
“You did this because she said that?”<br/>
Jem’s lips moved, but his, “Yes sir,” was inaudible.<br/>
“Son, I have no doubt that you’ve been annoyed by your contemporaries about&#160;<br/>
me lawing for niggers, as you say, but to do something like this to a sick old lady&#160;<br/>
is inexcusable. I strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Dubose,” said Atticus. “Come straight home afterward.”<br/>
Jem did not move.<br/>
“Go on, I said.”<br/>
I followed Jem out of the livingroom. “Come back here,” Atticus said to me. I&#160;<br/>
came back.<br/>
Atticus picked up the&#160;<i>Mobile Press</i>&#160;and sat down in the rocking chair Jem had&#160;<br/>
vacated. For the life of me, I did not understand how he could sit there in cold&#160;<br/>
blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being&#160;<br/>
murdered with a Confederate Army relic. Of course Jem antagonized me&#160;<br/>
sometimes until I could kill him, but when it came down to it he was all I had.&#160;<br/>
Atticus did not seem to realize this, or if he did he didn’t care.<br/>
I hated him for that, but when you are in trouble you become easily tired: soon I&#160;<br/>
was hiding in his lap and his arms were around me.<br/>
“You’re mighty big to be rocked,” he said.<br/>
“You don’t care what happens to him,” I said. “You just send him on to get shot&#160;<br/>
at when all he was doin‘ was standin’ up for you.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=108></a>Atticus pushed my head under his chin. “It’s not time to worry yet,” he said. “I&#160;<br/>
never thought Jem’d be the one to lose his head over this—thought I’d have more&#160;<br/>
trouble with you.”<br/>
I said I didn’t see why we had to keep our heads anyway, that nobody I knew at&#160;<br/>
school had to keep his head about anything.<br/>
“Scout,” said Atticus, “when summer comes you’ll have to keep your head about&#160;<br/>
far worse things… it’s not fair for you and Jem, I know that, but sometimes we&#160;<br/>
have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips&#160;<br/>
are down—well, all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown, maybe you’ll look&#160;<br/>
back on this with some compassion and some feeling that I didn’t let you down.&#160;<br/>
This case, Tom Robinson’s case, is something that goes to the essence of a man’s&#160;<br/>
conscience—Scout, I couldn’t go to church and worship God if I didn’t try to help&#160;<br/>
that man.”<br/>
“Atticus, you must be wrong…”<br/>
“How’s that?”<br/>
“Well, most folks seem to think they’re right and you’re wrong…”<br/>
“They’re certainly entitled to think that, and they’re entitled to full respect for&#160;<br/>
their opinions,” said Atticus, “but before I can live with other folks I’ve got to live&#160;<br/>
with myself. The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s&#160;<br/>
conscience.”<br/>
When Jem returned, he found me still in Atticus’s lap, “Well, son?” said Atticus.&#160;<br/>
He set me on my feet, and I made a secret reconnaissance of Jem. He seemed to&#160;<br/>
be all in one piece, but he had a queer look on his face. Perhaps she had given him&#160;<br/>
a dose of calomel.<br/>
“I cleaned it up for her and said I was sorry, but I ain’t, and that I’d work on ‘em&#160;<br/>
ever Saturday and try to make ’em grow back out.”<br/>
“There was no point in saying you were sorry if you aren’t,” said Atticus. “Jem,&#160;<br/>
she’s old and ill. You can’t hold her responsible for what she says and does. Of&#160;<br/>
course, I’d rather she’d have said it to me than to either of you, but we can’t&#160;<br/>
always have our ‘druthers.”<br/>
Jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet. “Atticus,” he said, “she wants me&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=109></a>to read to her.”<br/>
“Read to her?”<br/>
“Yes sir. She wants me to come every afternoon after school and Saturdays and&#160;<br/>
read to her out loud for two hours. Atticus, do I have to?”<br/>
“Certainly.”<br/>
“But she wants me to do it for a month.”<br/>
“Then you’ll do it for a month.”<br/>
Jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in.&#160;<br/>
Finally he said, “Atticus, it’s all right on the sidewalk but inside it’s—it’s all dark&#160;<br/>
and creepy. There’s shadows and things on the ceiling…”<br/>
Atticus smiled grimly. “That should appeal to your imagination. Just pretend&#160;<br/>
you’re inside the Radley house.”<br/>
The following Monday afternoon Jem and I climbed the steep front steps to Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Dubose’s house and padded down the open hallway. Jem, armed with&#160;<i>Ivanhoe</i>&#160;<br/>
and full of superior knowledge, knocked at the second door on the left.<br/>
“Mrs. Dubose?” he called.<br/>
Jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door.<br/>
“Is that you, Jem Finch?” she said. “You got your sister with you. I don’t know—”<br/>
“Let ‘em both in, Jessie,” said Mrs. Dubose. Jessie admitted us and went off to the&#160;<br/>
kitchen.<br/>
An oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold, an odor I had met&#160;<br/>
many times in rain-rotted gray houses where there are coal-oil lamps, water&#160;<br/>
dippers, and unbleached domestic sheets. It always made me afraid, expectant,&#160;<br/>
watchful.<br/>
In the corner of the room was a brass bed, and in the bed was Mrs. Dubose. I&#160;<br/>
wondered if Jem’s activities had put her there, and for a moment I felt sorry for&#160;<br/>
her. She was lying under a pile of quilts and looked almost friendly.<br/>
There was a marble-topped washstand by her bed; on it were a glass with a&#160;<br/>
teaspoon in it, a red ear syringe, a box of absorbent cotton, and a steel alarm clock&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=110></a>standing on three tiny legs.<br/>
“So you brought that dirty little sister of yours, did you?” was her greeting.<br/>
Jem said quietly, “My sister ain’t dirty and I ain’t scared of you,” although I&#160;<br/>
noticed his knees shaking.<br/>
I was expecting a tirade, but all she said was, “You may commence reading,&#160;<br/>
Jeremy.”<br/>
Jem sat down in a cane-bottom chair and opened&#160;<i>Ivanhoe</i>. I pulled up another one&#160;<br/>
and sat beside him.<br/>
“Come closer,” said Mrs. Dubose. “Come to the side of the bed.”<br/>
We moved our chairs forward. This was the nearest I had ever been to her, and&#160;<br/>
the thing I wanted most to do was move my chair back again.<br/>
She was horrible. Her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase, and the corners of&#160;<br/>
her mouth glistened with wet, which inched like a glacier down the deep grooves&#160;<br/>
enclosing her chin. Old-age liver spots dotted her cheeks, and her pale eyes had&#160;<br/>
black pinpoint pupils. Her hands were knobby, and the cuticles were grown up&#160;<br/>
over her fingernails. Her bottom plate was not in, and her upper lip protruded;&#160;<br/>
from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her&#160;<br/>
chin with it. This made the wet move faster.<br/>
I didn’t look any more than I had to. Jem reopened&#160;<i>Ivanhoe</i>&#160;and began reading. I&#160;<br/>
tried to keep up with him, but he read too fast. When Jem came to a word he&#160;<br/>
didn’t know, he skipped it, but Mrs. Dubose would catch him and make him spell&#160;<br/>
it out. Jem read for perhaps twenty minutes, during which time I looked at the&#160;<br/>
soot-stained mantelpiece, out the window, anywhere to keep from looking at her.&#160;<br/>
As he read along, I noticed that Mrs. Dubose’s corrections grew fewer and farther&#160;<br/>
between, that Jem had even left one sentence dangling in mid-air. She was not&#160;<br/>
listening.<br/>
I looked toward the bed.<br/>
Something had happened to her. She lay on her back, with the quilts up to her&#160;<br/>
chin. Only her head and shoulders were visible. Her head moved slowly from side&#160;<br/>
to side. From time to time she would open her mouth wide, and I could see her&#160;<br/>
tongue undulate faintly. Cords of saliva would collect on her lips; she would draw&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=111></a>them in, then open her mouth again. Her mouth seemed to have a private&#160;<br/>
existence of its own. It worked separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in,&#160;<br/>
like a clam hole at low tide. Occasionally it would say, “Pt,” like some viscous&#160;<br/>
substance coming to a boil.<br/>
I pulled Jem’s sleeve.<br/>
He looked at me, then at the bed. Her head made its regular sweep toward us, and&#160;<br/>
Jem said, “Mrs. Dubose, are you all right?” She did not hear him.<br/>
The alarm clock went off and scared us stiff. A minute later, nerves still tingling,&#160;<br/>
Jem and I were on the sidewalk headed for home. We did not run away, Jessie&#160;<br/>
sent us: before the clock wound down she was in the room pushing Jem and me&#160;<br/>
out of it.<br/>
“Shoo,” she said, “you all go home.”<br/>
Jem hesitated at the door.<br/>
“It’s time for her medicine,” Jessie said. As the door swung shut behind us I saw&#160;<br/>
Jessie walking quickly toward Mrs. Dubose’s bed.<br/>
It was only three forty-five when we got home, so Jem and I drop-kicked in the&#160;<br/>
back yard until it was time to meet Atticus. Atticus had two yellow pencils for me&#160;<br/>
and a football magazine for Jem, which I suppose was a silent reward for our first&#160;<br/>
day’s session with Mrs. Dubose. Jem told him what happened.<br/>
“Did she frighten you?” asked Atticus.<br/>
“No sir,” said Jem, “but she’s so nasty. She has fits or somethin‘. She spits a lot.”<br/>
“She can’t help that. When people are sick they don’t look nice sometimes.”<br/>
“She scared me,” I said.<br/>
Atticus looked at me over his glasses. “You don’t have to go with Jem, you&#160;<br/>
know.”<br/>
The next afternoon at Mrs. Dubose’s was the same as the first, and so was the&#160;<br/>
next, until gradually a pattern emerged: everything would begin normally—that&#160;<br/>
is, Mrs. Dubose would hound Jem for a while on her favorite subjects, her&#160;<br/>
camellias and our father’s nigger-loving propensities; she would grow&#160;<br/>
increasingly silent, then go away from us. The alarm clock would ring, Jessie&#160;<br/>
would shoo us out, and the rest of the day was ours.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=112></a>“Atticus,” I said one evening, “what exactly is a nigger-lover?”<br/>
Atticus’s face was grave. “Has somebody been calling you that?”<br/>
“No sir, Mrs. Dubose calls you that. She warms up every afternoon calling you&#160;<br/>
that. Francis called me that last Christmas, that’s where I first heard it.”<br/>
“Is that the reason you jumped on him?” asked Atticus.<br/>
“Yes sir…”<br/>
“Then why are you asking me what it means?”<br/>
I tried to explain to Atticus that it wasn’t so much what Francis said that had&#160;<br/>
infuriated me as the way he had said it. “It was like he’d said snot-nose or&#160;<br/>
somethin‘.”<br/>
“Scout,” said Atticus, “nigger-lover is just one of those terms that don’t mean&#160;<br/>
anything—like snot-nose. It’s hard to explain—ignorant, trashy people use it&#160;<br/>
when they think somebody’s favoring Negroes over and above themselves. It’s&#160;<br/>
slipped into usage with some people like ourselves, when they want a common,&#160;<br/>
ugly term to label somebody.”<br/>
“You aren’t really a nigger-lover, then, are you?”<br/>
“I certainly am. I do my best to love everybody… I’m hard put, sometimes—<br/>
baby, it’s never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just&#160;<br/>
shows you how poor that person is, it doesn’t hurt you. So don’t let Mrs. Dubose&#160;<br/>
get you down. She has enough troubles of her own.”<br/>
One afternoon a month later Jem was ploughing his way through Sir Walter&#160;<br/>
Scout, as Jem called him, and Mrs. Dubose was correcting him at every turn,&#160;<br/>
when there was a knock on the door. “Come in!” she screamed.<br/>
Atticus came in. He went to the bed and took Mrs. Dubose’s hand. “I was coming&#160;<br/>
from the office and didn’t see the children,” he said. “I thought they might still be&#160;<br/>
here.”<br/>
Mrs. Dubose smiled at him. For the life of me I could not figure out how she&#160;<br/>
could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so. “Do you&#160;<br/>
know what time it is, Atticus?” she said. “Exactly fourteen minutes past five. The&#160;<br/>
alarm clock’s set for five-thirty. I want you to know that.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=113></a>It suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Dubose’s, that the alarm clock went off a few minutes later every day, and that&#160;<br/>
she was well into one of her fits by the time it sounded. Today she had&#160;<br/>
antagonized Jem for nearly two hours with no intention of having a fit, and I felt&#160;<br/>
hopelessly trapped. The alarm clock was the signal for our release; if one day it&#160;<br/>
did not ring, what would we do?<br/>
“I have a feeling that Jem’s reading days are numbered,” said Atticus.<br/>
“Only a week longer, I think,” she said, “just to make sure…”<br/>
Jem rose. “But—”<br/>
Atticus put out his hand and Jem was silent. On the way home, Jem said he had to&#160;<br/>
do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasn’t fair.<br/>
“Just one more week, son,” said Atticus.<br/>
“No,” said Jem. “Yes,” said Atticus.&#160;<br/>
The following week found us back at Mrs. Dubose’s. The alarm clock had ceased&#160;<br/>
sounding, but Mrs. Dubose would release us with, “That’ll do,” so late in the&#160;<br/>
afternoon Atticus would be home reading the paper when we returned. Although&#160;<br/>
her fits had passed off, she was in every other way her old self: when Sir Walter&#160;<br/>
Scott became involved in lengthy descriptions of moats and castles, Mrs. Dubose&#160;<br/>
would become bored and pick on us:<br/>
“Jeremy Finch, I told you you’d live to regret tearing up my camellias. You regret&#160;<br/>
it now, don’t you?”<br/>
Jem would say he certainly did.<br/>
“Thought you could kill my Snow-on-the-Mountain, did you? Well, Jessie says&#160;<br/>
the top’s growing back out. Next time you’ll know how to do it right, won’t you?&#160;<br/>
You’ll pull it up by the roots, won’t you?”<br/>
Jem would say he certainly would.<br/>
“Don’t you mutter at me, boy! You hold up your head and say yes ma’am. Don’t&#160;<br/>
guess you feel like holding it up, though, with your father what he is.”<br/>
Jem’s chin would come up, and he would gaze at Mrs. Dubose with a face devoid&#160;<br/>
of resentment. Through the weeks he had cultivated an expression of polite and&#160;<br/>
detached interest, which he would present to her in answer to her most blood-<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=114></a>curdling inventions.<br/>
At last the day came. When Mrs. Dubose said, “That’ll do,” one afternoon, she&#160;<br/>
added, “And that’s all. Good-day to you.”<br/>
It was over. We bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief, leaping&#160;<br/>
and howling.<br/>
That spring was a good one: the days grew longer and gave us more playing time.&#160;<br/>
Jem’s mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics of every college football&#160;<br/>
player in the nation. Every night Atticus would read us the sports pages of the&#160;<br/>
newspapers. Alabama might go to the Rose Bowl again this year, judging from its&#160;<br/>
prospects, not one of whose names we could pronounce. Atticus was in the&#160;<br/>
middle of Windy Seaton’s column one evening when the telephone rang.<br/>
He answered it, then went to the hat rack in the hall. “I’m going down to Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Dubose’s for a while,” he said. “I won’t be long.”<br/>
But Atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime. When he returned he was&#160;<br/>
carrying a candy box. Atticus sat down in the livingroom and put the box on the&#160;<br/>
floor beside his chair.<br/>
“What’d she want?” asked Jem.<br/>
We had not seen Mrs. Dubose for over a month. She was never on the porch any&#160;<br/>
more when we passed.<br/>
“She’s dead, son,” said Atticus. “She died a few minutes ago.”<br/>
“Oh,” said Jem. “Well.”<br/>
“Well is right,” said Atticus. “She’s not suffering any more. She was sick for a&#160;<br/>
long time. Son, didn’t you know what her fits were?”<br/>
Jem shook his head.<br/>
“Mrs. Dubose was a morphine addict,” said Atticus. “She took it as a pain-killer&#160;<br/>
for years. The doctor put her on it. She’d have spent the rest of her life on it and&#160;<br/>
died without so much agony, but she was too contrary—”<br/>
“Sir?” said Jem.<br/>
Atticus said, “Just before your escapade she called me to make her will. Dr.&#160;<br/>
Reynolds told her she had only a few months left. Her business affairs were in&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=115></a>perfect order but she said, ‘There’s still one thing out of order.’”<br/>
“What was that?” Jem was perplexed.<br/>
“She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody. Jem,&#160;<br/>
when you’re sick as she was, it’s all right to take anything to make it easier, but it&#160;<br/>
wasn’t all right for her. She said she meant to break herself of it before she died,&#160;<br/>
and that’s what she did.”<br/>
Jem said, “You mean that’s what her fits were?”<br/>
“Yes, that’s what they were. Most of the time you were reading to her I doubt if&#160;<br/>
she heard a word you said. Her whole mind and body were concentrated on that&#160;<br/>
alarm clock. If you hadn’t fallen into her hands, I’d have made you go read to her&#160;<br/>
anyway. It may have been some distraction. There was another reason—”<br/>
“Did she die free?” asked Jem.<br/>
“As the mountain air,” said Atticus. “She was conscious to the last, almost.&#160;<br/>
Conscious,” he smiled, “and cantankerous. She still disapproved heartily of my&#160;<br/>
doings, and said I’d probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail. She&#160;<br/>
had Jessie fix you this box—”<br/>
Atticus reached down and picked up the candy box. He handed it to Jem.<br/>
Jem opened the box. Inside, surrounded by wads of damp cotton, was a white,&#160;<br/>
waxy, perfect camellia. It was a Snow-on-the-Mountain.<br/>
Jem’s eyes nearly popped out of his head. “Old hell-devil, old hell-devil!” he&#160;<br/>
screamed, flinging it down. “Why can’t she leave me alone?”<br/>
In a flash Atticus was up and standing over him. Jem buried his face in Atticus’s&#160;<br/>
shirt front. “Sh-h,” he said. “I think that was her way of telling you—everything’s&#160;<br/>
all right now, Jem, everything’s all right. You know, she was a great lady.”<br/>
“A lady?” Jem raised his head. His face was scarlet. “After all those things she&#160;<br/>
said about you, a lady?”<br/>
“She was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from mine,&#160;<br/>
maybe… son, I told you that if you hadn’t lost your head I’d have made you go&#160;<br/>
read to her. I wanted you to see something about her—I wanted you to see what&#160;<br/>
real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his&#160;<br/>
hand. It’s when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=116></a>and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she&#160;<br/>
died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.”<br/>
Jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire. He picked up the camellia,&#160;<br/>
and when I went off to bed I saw him fingering the wide petals. Atticus was&#160;<br/>
reading the paper.<br/>

<b>&#160;Chapter 12</b><br/>
Jem was twelve. He was difficult to live with, inconsistent, moody. His appetite&#160;<br/>
was appalling, and he told me so many times to stop pestering him I consulted&#160;<br/>
Atticus: “Reckon he’s got a tapeworm?” Atticus said no, Jem was growing. I must&#160;<br/>
be patient with him and disturb him as little as possible.<br/>
This change in Jem had come about in a matter of weeks. Mrs. Dubose was not&#160;<br/>
cold in her grave—Jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he&#160;<br/>
went to read to her. Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values&#160;<br/>
and was trying to impose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me&#160;<br/>
what to do. After one altercation when Jem hollered, “It’s time you started bein‘ a&#160;<br/>
girl and acting right!” I burst into tears and fled to Calpurnia.<br/>
“Don’t you fret too much over Mister Jem—” she began.<br/>
“Mister Jem?”<br/>
“Yeah, he’s just about Mister Jem now.”<br/>
“He ain’t that old,” I said. “All he needs is somebody to beat him up, and I ain’t&#160;<br/>
big enough.”<br/>
“Baby,” said Calpurnia, “I just can’t help it if Mister Jem’s growin‘ up. He’s&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=117></a>gonna want to be off to himself a lot now, doin’ whatever boys do, so you just&#160;<br/>
come right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome. We’ll find lots of things to&#160;<br/>
do in here.”<br/>
The beginning of that summer boded well: Jem could do as he pleased; Calpurnia&#160;<br/>
would do until Dill came. She seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the&#160;<br/>
kitchen, and by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in&#160;<br/>
being a girl.<br/>
But summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from&#160;<br/>
him. The letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he&#160;<br/>
would have to stay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. His&#160;<br/>
father was a lawyer like Atticus, only much younger. Dill’s new father had a&#160;<br/>
pleasant face, which made me glad Dill had captured him, but I was crushed. Dill&#160;<br/>
concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry, he would come&#160;<br/>
get me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together, so please write.<br/>
The fact that I had a permanent fiancé was little compensation for his absence: I&#160;<br/>
had never thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string,&#160;<br/>
Dill’s eyes alive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; summer&#160;<br/>
was the swiftness with which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not&#160;<br/>
looking, the longings we sometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was&#160;<br/>
routine; without him, life was unbearable. I stayed miserable for two days.<br/>
As if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into emergency session&#160;<br/>
and Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor was eager to scrape a few&#160;<br/>
barnacles off the ship of state; there were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread&#160;<br/>
lines in the cities grew longer, people in the country grew poorer. But these were&#160;<br/>
events remote from the world of Jem and me.<br/>
We were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the&#160;<i>Montgomery Advertiser</i>&#160;<br/>
above the caption, “Maycomb’s Finch.” It showed Atticus barefooted and in short&#160;<br/>
pants, chained to a desk: he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous-<br/>
looking girls yelled, “Yoo-hoo!” at him.<br/>
“That’s a compliment,” explained Jem. “He spends his time doin‘ things that&#160;<br/>
wouldn’t get done if nobody did ’em.”<br/>
“Huh?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=118></a>In addition to Jem’s newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a&#160;<br/>
maddening air of wisdom.<br/>
“Oh, Scout, it’s like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things. That&#160;<br/>
kind of thing’s pretty dry to most men.”<br/>
“How do you know?”<br/>
“Oh, go on and leave me alone. I’m readin‘ the paper.”<br/>
Jem got his wish. I departed for the kitchen.<br/>
While she was shelling peas, Calpurnia suddenly said, “What am I gonna do&#160;<br/>
about you all’s church this Sunday?”<br/>
“Nothing, I reckon. Atticus left us collection.”<br/>
Calpurnia’s eyes narrowed and I could tell what was going through her mind.&#160;<br/>
“Cal,” I said, “you know we’ll behave. We haven’t done anything in church in&#160;<br/>
years.”<br/>
Calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy Sunday when we were both fatherless&#160;<br/>
and teacherless. Left to its own devices, the class tied Eunice Ann Simpson to a&#160;<br/>
chair and placed her in the furnace room. We forgot her, trooped upstairs to&#160;<br/>
church, and were listening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued&#160;<br/>
from the radiator pipes, persisting until someone investigated and brought forth&#160;<br/>
Eunice Ann saying she didn’t want to play Shadrach any more—Jem Finch said&#160;<br/>
she wouldn’t get burnt if she had enough faith, but it was hot down there.<br/>
“Besides, Cal, this isn’t the first time Atticus has left us,” I protested.<br/>
“Yeah, but he makes certain your teacher’s gonna be there. I didn’t hear him say&#160;<br/>
this time—reckon he forgot it.” Calpurnia scratched her head. Suddenly she&#160;<br/>
smiled. “How’d you and Mister Jem like to come to church with me tomorrow?”<br/>
“Really?”<br/>
“How ‘bout it?” grinned Calpurnia.<br/>
If Calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before, it was nothing compared to her&#160;<br/>
supervision of that Saturday night’s routine. She made me soap all over twice,&#160;<br/>
drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse; she stuck my head in the basin and&#160;<br/>
washed it with Octagon soap and castile. She had trusted Jem for years, but that&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=119></a>night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst: “Can’t anybody take a&#160;<br/>
bath in this house without the whole family lookin‘?”<br/>
Next morning she began earlier than usual, to “go over our clothes.” When&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia stayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen; that&#160;<br/>
morning it was covered with our Sunday habiliments. She had put so much starch&#160;<br/>
in my dress it came up like a tent when I sat down. She made me wear a petticoat&#160;<br/>
and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist. She went over my patent-<br/>
leather shoes with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them.<br/>
“It’s like we were goin‘ to Mardi Gras,” said Jem. “What’s all this for, Cal?”<br/>
“I don’t want anybody sayin‘ I don’t look after my children,” she muttered.&#160;<br/>
“Mister Jem, you absolutely can’t wear that tie with that suit. It’s green.”<br/>
“‘smatter with that?”<br/>
“Suit’s blue. Can’t you tell?”<br/>
“Hee hee,” I howled, “Jem’s color blind.”<br/>
His face flushed angrily, but Calpurnia said, “Now you all quit that. You’re gonna&#160;<br/>
go to First Purchase with smiles on your faces.”<br/>
First Purchase African M.E. Church was in the Quarters outside the southern&#160;<br/>
town limits, across the old sawmill tracks. It was an ancient paint-peeled frame&#160;<br/>
building, the only church in Maycomb with a steeple and bell, called First&#160;<br/>
Purchase because it was paid for from the first earnings of freed slaves. Negroes&#160;<br/>
worshiped in it on Sundays and white men gambled in it on weekdays.<br/>
The churchyard was brick-hard clay, as was the cemetery beside it. If someone&#160;<br/>
died during a dry spell, the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain&#160;<br/>
softened the earth. A few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling&#160;<br/>
tombstones; newer ones were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken&#160;<br/>
Coca-Cola bottles. Lightning rods guarding some graves denoted dead who rested&#160;<br/>
uneasily; stumps of burned-out candles stood at the heads of infant graves. It was&#160;<br/>
a happy cemetery.<br/>
The warm bittersweet smell of clean Negro welcomed us as we entered the&#160;<br/>
churchyard—Hearts of Love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida, snuff, Hoyt’s&#160;<br/>
Cologne, Brown’s Mule, peppermint, and lilac talcum.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=120></a>When they saw Jem and me with Calpurnia, the men stepped back and took off&#160;<br/>
their hats; the women crossed their arms at their waists, weekday gestures of&#160;<br/>
respectful attention. They parted and made a small pathway to the church door for&#160;<br/>
us. Calpurnia walked between Jem and me, responding to the greetings of her&#160;<br/>
brightly clad neighbors.<br/>
“What you up to, Miss Cal?” said a voice behind us.<br/>
Calpurnia’s hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around:&#160;<br/>
standing in the path behind us was a tall Negro woman. Her weight was on one&#160;<br/>
leg; she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip, pointing at us with upturned&#160;<br/>
palm. She was bullet-headed with strange almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and&#160;<br/>
an Indian-bow mouth. She seemed seven feet high.<br/>
I felt Calpurnia’s hand dig into my shoulder. “What you want, Lula?” she asked,&#160;<br/>
in tones I had never heard her use. She spoke quietly, contemptuously.<br/>
“I wants to know why you bringin‘ white chillun to nigger church.”<br/>
“They’s my comp’ny,” said Calpurnia. Again I thought her voice strange: she was&#160;<br/>
talking like the rest of them.<br/>
“Yeah, an‘ I reckon you’s comp’ny at the Finch house durin’ the week.”<br/>
A murmur ran through the crowd. “Don’t you fret,” Calpurnia whispered to me,&#160;<br/>
but the roses on her hat trembled indignantly.<br/>
When Lula came up the pathway toward us Calpurnia said, “Stop right there,&#160;<br/>
nigger.”<br/>
Lula stopped, but she said, “You ain’t got no business bringin‘ white chillun here<br/>
—they got their church, we got our’n. It is our church, ain’t it, Miss Cal?”<br/>
Calpurnia said, “It’s the same God, ain’t it?”<br/>
Jem said, “Let’s go home, Cal, they don’t want us here—”<br/>
I agreed: they did not want us here. I sensed, rather than saw, that we were being&#160;<br/>
advanced upon. They seemed to be drawing closer to us, but when I looked up at&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes. When I looked down the pathway&#160;<br/>
again, Lula was gone. In her place was a solid mass of colored people.<br/>
One of them stepped from the crowd. It was Zeebo, the garbage collector. “Mister&#160;<br/>
Jem,” he said, “we’re mighty glad to have you all here. Don’t pay no ‘tention to&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=121></a>Lula, she’s contentious because Reverend Sykes threatened to church her. She’s a&#160;<br/>
troublemaker from way back, got fancy ideas an’ haughty ways—we’re mighty&#160;<br/>
glad to have you all.”<br/>
With that, Calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by&#160;<br/>
Reverend Sykes, who led us to the front pew.<br/>
First Purchase was unceiled and unpainted within. Along its walls unlighted&#160;<br/>
kerosene lamps hung on brass brackets; pine benches served as pews. Behind the&#160;<br/>
rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed God Is Love, the church’s&#160;<br/>
only decoration except a rotogravure print of Hunt’s&#160;<i>The Light of the World</i>.&#160;<br/>
There was no sign of piano, organ, hymn-books, church programs—the familiar&#160;<br/>
ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw every Sunday. It was dim inside, with a damp&#160;<br/>
coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation. At each seat was a cheap&#160;<br/>
cardboard fan bearing a garish Garden of Gethsemane, courtesy Tyndal’s&#160;<br/>
Hardware Co. (You-Name-It-We-Sell-It).<br/>
Calpurnia motioned Jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between&#160;<br/>
us. She fished in her purse, drew out her handkerchief, and untied the hard wad of&#160;<br/>
change in its corner. She gave a dime to me and a dime to Jem. “We’ve got ours,”&#160;<br/>
he whispered. “You keep it,” Calpurnia said, “you’re my company.” Jem’s face&#160;<br/>
showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime, but his innate&#160;<br/>
courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket. I did likewise with no qualms.<br/>
“Cal,” I whispered, “where are the hymn-books?”<br/>
“We don’t have any,” she said.<br/>
“Well how—?”<br/>
“Sh-h,” she said. Reverend Sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring the&#160;<br/>
congregation to silence. He was a short, stocky man in a black suit, black tie,&#160;<br/>
white shirt, and a gold watch-chain that glinted in the light from the frosted&#160;<br/>
windows.<br/>
He said, “Brethren and sisters, we are particularly glad to have company with us&#160;<br/>
this morning. Mister and Miss Finch. You all know their father. Before I begin I&#160;<br/>
will read some announcements.”<br/>
Reverend Sykes shuffled some papers, chose one and held it at arm’s length. “The&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=122></a>Missionary Society meets in the home of Sister Annette Reeves next Tuesday.&#160;<br/>
Bring your sewing.”<br/>
He read from another paper. “You all know of Brother Tom Robinson’s trouble.&#160;<br/>
He has been a faithful member of First Purchase since he was a boy. The&#160;<br/>
collection taken up today and for the next three Sundays will go to Helen—his&#160;<br/>
wife, to help her out at home.”<br/>
I punched Jem. “That’s the Tom Atticus’s de—”<br/>
“Sh-h!”<br/>
I turned to Calpurnia but was hushed before I opened my mouth. Subdued, I fixed&#160;<br/>
my attention upon Reverend Sykes, who seemed to be waiting for me to settle&#160;<br/>
down. “Will the music superintendent lead us in the first hymn,” he said.<br/>
Zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle, stopping in front of us&#160;<br/>
and facing the congregation. He was carrying a battered hymn-book. He opened it&#160;<br/>
and said, “We’ll sing number two seventy-three.”<br/>
This was too much for me. “How’re we gonna sing it if there ain’t any hymn-<br/>
books?”<br/>
Calpurnia smiled. “Hush baby,” she whispered, “you’ll see in a minute.”<br/>
Zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery:<br/>
“There’s a land beyond the river.”<br/>
Miraculously on pitch, a hundred voices sang out Zeebo’s words. The last&#160;<br/>
syllable, held to a husky hum, was followed by Zeebo saying, “That we call the&#160;<br/>
sweet forever.”<br/>
Music again swelled around us; the last note lingered and Zeebo met it with the&#160;<br/>
next line: “And we only reach that shore by faith’s decree.”<br/>
The congregation hesitated, Zeebo repeated the line carefully, and it was sung. At&#160;<br/>
the chorus Zeebo closed the book, a signal for the congregation to proceed&#160;<br/>
without his help.<br/>
On the dying notes of “Jubilee,” Zeebo said, “In that far-off sweet forever, just&#160;<br/>
beyond the shining river.”<br/>
Line for line, voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=123></a>melancholy murmur.<br/>
I looked at Jem, who was looking at Zeebo from the corners of his eyes. I didn’t&#160;<br/>
believe it either, but we had both heard it.<br/>
Reverend Sykes then called on the Lord to bless the sick and the suffering, a&#160;<br/>
procedure no different from our church practice, except Reverend Sykes directed&#160;<br/>
the Deity’s attention to several specific cases.<br/>
His sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin, an austere declaration of the&#160;<br/>
motto on the wall behind him: he warned his flock against the evils of heady&#160;<br/>
brews, gambling, and strange women. Bootleggers caused enough trouble in the&#160;<br/>
Quarters, but women were worse. Again, as I had often met it in my own church,&#160;<br/>
I was confronted with the Impurity of Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy&#160;<br/>
all clergymen.<br/>
Jem and I had heard the same sermon Sunday after Sunday, with only one&#160;<br/>
exception. Reverend Sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on&#160;<br/>
individual lapses from grace: Jim Hardy had been absent from church for five&#160;<br/>
Sundays and he wasn’t sick; Constance Jackson had better watch her ways—she&#160;<br/>
was in grave danger for quarreling with her neighbors; she had erected the only&#160;<br/>
spite fence in the history of the Quarters.<br/>
Reverend Sykes closed his sermon. He stood beside a table in front of the pulpit&#160;<br/>
and requested the morning offering, a proceeding that was strange to Jem and me.&#160;<br/>
One by one, the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a&#160;<br/>
black enameled coffee can. Jem and I followed suit, and received a soft, “Thank&#160;<br/>
you, thank you,” as our dimes clinked.<br/>
To our amazement, Reverend Sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the&#160;<br/>
coins into his hand. He straightened up and said, “This is not enough, we must&#160;<br/>
have ten dollars.”<br/>
The congregation stirred. “You all know what it’s for—Helen can’t leave those&#160;<br/>
children to work while Tom’s in jail. If everybody gives one more dime, we’ll&#160;<br/>
have it—” Reverend Sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of&#160;<br/>
the church. “Alec, shut the doors. Nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars.”<br/>
Calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin&#160;<br/>
purse. “Naw Cal,” Jem whispered, when she handed him a shiny quarter, “we can&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=124></a>put ours in. Gimme your dime, Scout.”<br/>
The church was becoming stuffy, and it occurred to me that Reverend Sykes&#160;<br/>
intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock. Fans crackled, feet shuffled,&#160;<br/>
tobacco-chewers were in agony.<br/>
Reverend Sykes startled me by saying sternly, “Carlow Richardson, I haven’t&#160;<br/>
seen you up this aisle yet.”<br/>
A thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin. The&#160;<br/>
congregation murmured approval.<br/>
Reverend Sykes then said, “I want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice&#160;<br/>
and give one more dime apiece. Then we’ll have it.”<br/>
Slowly, painfully, the ten dollars was collected. The door was opened, and the&#160;<br/>
gust of warm air revived us. Zeebo lined On&#160;<i>Jordan’s Stormy Banks</i>, and church&#160;<br/>
was over.<br/>
I wanted to stay and explore, but Calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of&#160;<br/>
her. At the church door, while she paused to talk with Zeebo and his family, Jem&#160;<br/>
and I chatted with Reverend Sykes. I was bursting with questions, but decided I&#160;<br/>
would wait and let Calpurnia answer them.<br/>
“We were ‘specially glad to have you all here,” said Reverend Sykes. “This&#160;<br/>
church has no better friend than your daddy.”<br/>
My curiosity burst: “Why were you all takin‘ up collection for Tom Robinson’s&#160;<br/>
wife?”<br/>
“Didn’t you hear why?” asked Reverend Sykes. “Helen’s got three little’uns and&#160;<br/>
she can’t go out to work—”<br/>
“Why can’t she take ‘em with her, Reverend?” I asked. It was customary for field&#160;<br/>
Negroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while&#160;<br/>
their parents worked—usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of&#160;<br/>
cotton. Those unable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothers’ backs,&#160;<br/>
or resided in extra cotton bags.<br/>
Reverend Sykes hesitated. “To tell you the truth, Miss Jean Louise, Helen’s&#160;<br/>
finding it hard to get work these days… when it’s picking time, I think Mr. Link&#160;<br/>
Deas’ll take her.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=125></a>“Why not, Reverend?”<br/>
Before he could answer, I felt Calpurnia’s hand on my shoulder. At its pressure I&#160;<br/>
said, “We thank you for lettin‘ us come.” Jem echoed me, and we made our way&#160;<br/>
homeward.<br/>
“Cal, I know Tom Robinson’s in jail an‘ he’s done somethin’ awful, but why&#160;<br/>
won’t folks hire Helen?” I asked.<br/>
Calpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between Jem and me.&#160;<br/>
“It’s because of what folks say Tom’s done,” she said. “Folks aren’t anxious to—<br/>
to have anything to do with any of his family.”<br/>
“Just what did he do, Cal?”<br/>
Calpurnia sighed. “Old Mr. Bob Ewell accused him of rapin‘ his girl an’ had him&#160;<br/>
arrested an‘ put in jail—”<br/>
“Mr. Ewell?” My memory stirred. “Does he have anything to do with those&#160;<br/>
Ewells that come every first day of school an‘ then go home? Why, Atticus said&#160;<br/>
they were absolute trash—I never heard Atticus talk about folks the way he talked&#160;<br/>
about the Ewells. He said-”<br/>
“Yeah, those are the ones.”<br/>
“Well, if everybody in Maycomb knows what kind of folks the Ewells are they’d&#160;<br/>
be glad to hire Helen… what’s rape, Cal?”<br/>
“It’s somethin‘ you’ll have to ask Mr. Finch about,” she said. “He can explain it&#160;<br/>
better than I can. You all hungry? The Reverend took a long time unwindin’ this&#160;<br/>
morning, he’s not usually so tedious.”<br/>
“He’s just like our preacher,” said Jem, “but why do you all sing hymns that&#160;<br/>
way?”<br/>
“Linin‘?” she asked.<br/>
“Is that what it is?”<br/>
“Yeah, it’s called linin‘. They’ve done it that way as long as I can remember.”<br/>
Jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get&#160;<br/>
some hymn-books.<br/>
Calpurnia laughed. “Wouldn’t do any good,” she said. “They can’t read.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=126></a>“Can’t read?” I asked. “All those folks?”<br/>
“That’s right,” Calpurnia nodded. “Can’t but about four folks in First Purchase&#160;<br/>
read… I’m one of ‘em.”<br/>
“Where’d you go to school, Cal?” asked Jem.<br/>
“Nowhere. Let’s see now, who taught me my letters? It was Miss Maudie&#160;<br/>
Atkinson’s aunt, old Miss Buford—”<br/>
“Are you&#160;<i>that</i>&#160;old?”<br/>
“I’m older than Mr. Finch, even.” Calpurnia grinned. “Not sure how much,&#160;<br/>
though. We started rememberin‘ one time, trying to figure out how old I was—I&#160;<br/>
can remember back just a few years more’n he can, so I’m not much older, when&#160;<br/>
you take off the fact that men can’t remember as well as women.”<br/>
“What’s your birthday, Cal?”<br/>
“I just have it on Christmas, it’s easier to remember that way—I don’t have a real&#160;<br/>
birthday.”<br/>
“But Cal,” Jem protested, “you don’t look even near as old as Atticus.”<br/>
“Colored folks don’t show their ages so fast,” she said.<br/>
“Maybe because they can’t read. Cal, did you teach Zeebo?”<br/>
“Yeah, Mister Jem. There wasn’t a school even when he was a boy. I made him&#160;<br/>
learn, though.”<br/>
Zeebo was Calpurnia’s eldest son. If I had ever thought about it, I would have&#160;<br/>
known that Calpurnia was of mature years—Zeebo had half-grown children—but&#160;<br/>
then I had never thought about it.<br/>
“Did you teach him out of a primer, like us?” I asked.<br/>
“No, I made him get a page of the Bible every day, and there was a book Miss&#160;<br/>
Buford taught me out of—bet you don’t know where I got it,” she said.<br/>
We didn’t know.<br/>
Calpurnia said, “Your Granddaddy Finch gave it to me.”<br/>
“Were you from the Landing?” Jem asked. “You never told us that.”<br/>
“I certainly am, Mister Jem. Grew up down there between the Buford Place and&#160;<br/>
the Landin‘. I’ve spent all my days workin’ for the Finches or the Bufords, an‘ I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=127></a>moved to Maycomb when your daddy and your mamma married.”<br/>
“What was the book, Cal?” I asked.<br/>
“Blackstone’s&#160;<i>Commentaries</i>.”<br/>
Jem was thunderstruck. “You mean you taught Zeebo outa&#160;<i>that</i>?”<br/>
“Why yes sir, Mister Jem.” Calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth. “They&#160;<br/>
were the only books I had. Your grandaddy said Mr. Blackstone wrote fine&#160;<br/>
English—”<br/>
“That’s why you don’t talk like the rest of ‘em,” said Jem.<br/>
“The rest of who?”<br/>
“Rest of the colored folks. Cal, but you talked like they did in church…”<br/>
That Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she&#160;<br/>
had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of&#160;<br/>
her having command of two languages. “Cal,” I asked, “why do you talk nigger-<br/>
talk to the—to your folks when you know it’s not right?”<br/>
“Well, in the first place I’m black—”<br/>
“That doesn’t mean you hafta talk that way when you know better,” said Jem.<br/>
Calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head, then pressed her hat down&#160;<br/>
carefully over her ears. “It’s right hard to say,” she said. “Suppose you and Scout&#160;<br/>
talked colored-folks’ talk at home it’d be out of place, wouldn’t it? Now what if I&#160;<br/>
talked white-folks’ talk at church, and with my neighbors? They’d think I was&#160;<br/>
puttin‘ on airs to beat Moses.”<br/>
“But Cal, you know better,” I said.<br/>
“It’s not necessary to tell all you know. It’s not ladylike—in the second place,&#160;<br/>
folks don’t like to have somebody around knowin‘ more than they do. It&#160;<br/>
aggravates ’em. You’re not gonna change any of them by talkin‘ right, they’ve&#160;<br/>
got to want to learn themselves, and when they don’t want to learn there’s nothing&#160;<br/>
you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language.”<br/>
“Cal, can I come to see you sometimes?”<br/>
She looked down at me. “See me, honey? You see me every day.”<br/>
“Out to your house,” I said. “Sometimes after work? Atticus can get me.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=128></a>“Any time you want to,” she said. “We’d be glad to have you.”<br/>
We were on the sidewalk by the Radley Place.<br/>
“Look on the porch yonder,” Jem said.<br/>
I looked over to the Radley Place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning&#160;<br/>
himself in the swing. The swing was empty.<br/>
“I mean our porch,” said Jem.<br/>
I looked down the street. Enarmored, upright, uncompromising, Aunt Alexandra&#160;<br/>
was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life.<br/>

<b>Chapter 13</b><br/>
“Put my bag in the front bedroom, Calpurnia,” was the first thing Aunt Alexandra&#160;<br/>
said. “Jean Louise, stop scratching your head,” was the second thing she said.<br/>
Calpurnia picked up Aunty’s heavy suitcase and opened the door. “I’ll take it,”&#160;<br/>
said Jem, and took it. I heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. The&#160;<br/>
sound had a dull permanence about it. “Have you come for a visit, Aunty?” I&#160;<br/>
asked. Aunt Alexandra’s visits from the Landing were rare, and she traveled in&#160;<br/>
state. She owned a bright green square Buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in&#160;<br/>
an unhealthy state of tidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen.<br/>
“Didn’t your father tell you?” she asked.<br/>
Jem and I shook our heads.<br/>
“Probably he forgot. He’s not in yet, is he?”<br/>
“Nome, he doesn’t usually get back till late afternoon,” said Jem.<br/>
“Well, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you for a while.”<br/>
“For a while” in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years. Jem&#160;<br/>
and I exchanged glances.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=129></a>“Jem’s growing up now and you are too,” she said to me. “We decided that it&#160;<br/>
would be best for you to have some feminine influence. It won’t be many years,&#160;<br/>
Jean Louise, before you become interested in clothes and boys—”<br/>
I could have made several answers to this: Cal’s a girl, it would be many years&#160;<br/>
before I would be interested in boys, I would never be interested in clothes… but&#160;<br/>
I kept quiet.<br/>
“What about Uncle Jimmy?” asked Jem. “Is he comin‘, too?”<br/>
“Oh no, he’s staying at the Landing. He’ll keep the place going.”<br/>
The moment I said, “Won’t you miss him?” I realized that this was not a tactful&#160;<br/>
question. Uncle Jimmy present or Uncle Jimmy absent made not much difference,&#160;<br/>
he never said anything. Aunt Alexandra ignored my question.<br/>
I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything&#160;<br/>
to say to her, and I sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: How are&#160;<br/>
you, Jean Louise? Fine, thank you ma’am, how are you? Very well, thank you,&#160;<br/>
what have you been doing with yourself? Nothin‘. Don’t you do anything? Nome.&#160;<br/>
Certainly you have friends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin’.<br/>
It was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I once heard her&#160;<br/>
tell Atticus that I was sluggish.<br/>
There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then.&#160;<br/>
Today was Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively irritable on the Lord’s&#160;<br/>
Day. I guess it was her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose&#160;<br/>
protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her&#160;<br/>
waist, flared out her rear, and managed to suggest that Aunt Alexandra’s was once&#160;<br/>
an hour-glass figure. From any angle, it was formidable.<br/>
The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when&#160;<br/>
relatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. It&#160;<br/>
was Atticus, home from Montgomery. Jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to&#160;<br/>
meet him. Jem seized his briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague&#160;<br/>
dry kiss and said, “‘d you bring me a book? ’d you know Aunty’s here?”<br/>
Atticus answered both questions in the affirmative. “How’d you like for her to&#160;<br/>
come live with us?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=130></a>I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certain&#160;<br/>
circumstances and at all times when one can’t do anything about them.<br/>
“We felt it was time you children needed—well, it’s like this, Scout,” Atticus&#160;<br/>
said. “Your aunt’s doing me a favor as well as you all. I can’t stay here all day&#160;<br/>
with you, and the summer’s going to be a hot one.”<br/>
“Yes sir,” I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that&#160;<br/>
Aunt Alexandra’s appearance on the scene was not so much Atticus’s doing as&#160;<br/>
hers. Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose&#160;<br/>
her coming to live with us was in that category.<br/>
Maycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded&#160;<br/>
with shinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra, consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying,&#160;<br/>
“Uh, uh, uh.” Miss Rachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons,&#160;<br/>
and Mr. Nathan Radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was&#160;<br/>
glad to see her.<br/>
When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra&#160;<br/>
seemed as if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments&#160;<br/>
added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the&#160;<br/>
delicacies required to sustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians);&#160;<br/>
she joined and became Secretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all&#160;<br/>
parties present and participating in the life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one&#160;<br/>
of the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral&#160;<br/>
come along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was&#160;<br/>
an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not&#160;<br/>
be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. She was never bored, and&#160;<br/>
given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would&#160;<br/>
arrange, advise, caution, and warn.<br/>
She never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal&#160;<br/>
groups to the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than&#160;<br/>
annoyed him: “Aunty better watch how she talks—scratch most folks in&#160;<br/>
Maycomb and they’re kin to us.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather’s suicide,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=131></a>said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a sixteen-year-old girl&#160;<br/>
giggle in the choir and Aunty would say, “It just goes to show you, all the&#160;<br/>
Penfield women are flighty.” Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a&#160;<br/>
Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak, a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.<br/>
Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford’s tendency to mind&#160;<br/>
other people’s business was hereditary, Atticus said, “Sister, when you stop to&#160;<br/>
think about it, our generation’s practically the first in the Finch family not to&#160;<br/>
marry its cousins. Would you say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?”<br/>
Aunty said no, that’s where we got our small hands and feet.<br/>
I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received&#160;<br/>
the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the&#160;<br/>
sense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that&#160;<br/>
the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.<br/>
“That makes the Ewells fine folks, then,” said Jem. The tribe of which Burris&#160;<br/>
Ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the&#160;<br/>
Maycomb dump, and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra’s theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an&#160;<br/>
ancient town. It was twenty miles east of Finch’s Landing, awkwardly inland for&#160;<br/>
such an old town. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not&#160;<br/>
been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history&#160;<br/>
operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory.&#160;<br/>
Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers&#160;<br/>
alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory&#160;<br/>
or the Creek Nation so long as business was good. Business was excellent when&#160;<br/>
Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created&#160;<br/>
county’s domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact&#160;<br/>
center and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfield’s&#160;<br/>
guests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County,&#160;<br/>
and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not&#160;<br/>
Sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat&#160;<br/>
in the middle of Winston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest. Instead,&#160;<br/>
Maycomb grew and sprawled out from its hub, Sinkfield’s Tavern, because&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=132></a>Sinkfield reduced his guests to myopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to&#160;<br/>
bring forward their maps and charts, lop off a little here, add a bit there, and&#160;<br/>
adjust the center of the county to meet his requirements. He sent them packing&#160;<br/>
next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebags—<br/>
two apiece and one for the Governor.<br/>
Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared&#160;<br/>
the grubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In the beginning&#160;<br/>
its buildings were solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide.&#160;<br/>
Maycomb’s proportion of professional people ran high: one went there to have his&#160;<br/>
teeth pulled, his wagon fixed, his heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul&#160;<br/>
saved, his mules vetted. But the ultimate wisdom of Sinkfield’s maneuver is open&#160;<br/>
to question. He placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public&#160;<br/>
transportation in those days—river-boat—and it took a man from the north end of&#160;<br/>
the county two days to travel to Maycomb for store-bought goods. As a result the&#160;<br/>
town remained the same size for a hundred years, an island in a patchwork sea of&#160;<br/>
cottonfields and timberland.<br/>
Although Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States,&#160;<br/>
Reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew inward.&#160;<br/>
New people so rarely settled there, the same families married the same families&#160;<br/>
until the members of the community looked faintly alike. Occasionally someone&#160;<br/>
would return from Montgomery or Mobile with an outsider, but the result caused&#160;<br/>
only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance. Things were more or less&#160;<br/>
the same during my early years.<br/>
There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way:&#160;<br/>
the older citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for&#160;<br/>
years and years, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted&#160;<br/>
attitudes, character shadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each&#160;<br/>
generation and refined by time. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own&#160;<br/>
Business, Every Third Merriweather Is Morbid, The Truth Is Not in the&#160;<br/>
Delafields, All the Bufords Walk Like That, were simply guides to daily living:&#160;<br/>
never take a check from a Delafield without a discreet call to the bank; Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie Atkinson’s shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. Grace&#160;<br/>
Merriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles it’s nothing unusual—her&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=133></a>mother did the same.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra fitted into the world of Maycomb like a hand into a glove, but&#160;<br/>
never into the world of Jem and me. I so often wondered how she could be&#160;<br/>
Atticus’s and Uncle Jack’s sister that I revived half-remembered tales of&#160;<br/>
changelings and mandrake roots that Jem had spun long ago.<br/>
These were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as she had little to&#160;<br/>
say to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went&#160;<br/>
to bed. It was summer and we were outdoors. Of course some afternoons when I&#160;<br/>
would run inside for a drink of water, I would find the livingroom overrun with&#160;<br/>
Maycomb ladies, sipping, whispering, fanning, and I would be called: “Jean&#160;<br/>
Louise, come speak to these ladies.”<br/>
When I appeared in the doorway, Aunty would look as if she regretted her&#160;<br/>
request; I was usually mud-splashed or covered with sand.<br/>
“Speak to your Cousin Lily,” she said one afternoon, when she had trapped me in&#160;<br/>
the hall.<br/>
“Who?” I said.<br/>
“Your Cousin Lily Brooke,” said Aunt Alexandra.<br/>
“She our cousin? I didn’t know that.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to&#160;<br/>
Cousin Lily and firm disapproval to me. When Cousin Lily Brooke left I knew I&#160;<br/>
was in for it.<br/>
It was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the Finch Family,&#160;<br/>
or to install any pride into his children. She summoned Jem, who sat warily on the&#160;<br/>
sofa beside me. She left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on&#160;<br/>
which Meditations of&#160;<i>Joshua S. St. Clair</i>&#160;was stamped in gold.<br/>
“Your cousin wrote this,” said Aunt Alexandra. “He was a beautiful character.”<br/>
Jem examined the small volume. “Is this the Cousin Joshua who was locked up&#160;<br/>
for so long?”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra said, “How did you know that?”<br/>
“Why, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=134></a>shoot the president. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasn’t anything but a sewer-<br/>
inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in&#160;<br/>
his hand. Atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that&#160;<br/>
one—”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was standing stiff as a stork. “That’s all,” she said. “We’ll see&#160;<br/>
about this.”<br/>
Before bedtime I was in Jem’s room trying to borrow a book, when Atticus&#160;<br/>
knocked and entered. He sat on the side of Jem’s bed, looked at us soberly, then&#160;<br/>
he grinned.<br/>
“&#160;<br/>
Er—h’rm,“ he said. He was beginning to preface some things he said with a&#160;<br/>
throaty noise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same.&#160;<br/>
”I don’t exactly know how to say this,“ he began.<br/>
“Well, just say it,” said Jem. “Have we done something?”<br/>
Our father was actually fidgeting. “No, I just want to explain to you that—your&#160;<br/>
Aunt Alexandra asked me… son, you know you’re a Finch, don’t you?”<br/>
“That’s what I’ve been told.” Jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. His voice&#160;<br/>
rose uncontrollably, “Atticus, what’s the matter?”<br/>
Atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. “I’m trying to tell you the facts of&#160;<br/>
life.”<br/>
Jem’s disgust deepened. “I know all that stuff,” he said.<br/>
Atticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyer’s voice, without a shade of&#160;<br/>
inflection, he said: “Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean&#160;<br/>
Louise that you are not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of&#160;<br/>
several generations’ gentle breeding—” Atticus paused, watching me locate an&#160;<br/>
elusive redbug on my leg.<br/>
“Gentle breeding,” he continued, when I had found and scratched it, “and that you&#160;<br/>
should try to live up to your name—” Atticus persevered in spite of us: “She&#160;<br/>
asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that&#160;<br/>
you are. She wants to talk to you about the family and what it’s meant to&#160;<br/>
Maycomb County through the years, so you’ll have some idea of who you are, so&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=135></a>you might be moved to behave accordingly,” he concluded at a gallop.<br/>
Stunned, Jem and I looked at each other, then at Atticus, whose collar seemed to&#160;<br/>
worry him. We did not speak to him.<br/>
Presently I picked up a comb from Jem’s dresser and ran its teeth along the edge.<br/>
“Stop that noise,” Atticus said.<br/>
His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it&#160;<br/>
down. For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was&#160;<br/>
not my father. My father never thought these thoughts. My father never spoke so.&#160;<br/>
Aunt Alexandra had put him up to this, somehow. Through my tears I saw Jem&#160;<br/>
standing in a similar pool of isolation, his head cocked to one side.<br/>
There was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticus’s vest front. I buried&#160;<br/>
my head in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the&#160;<br/>
light blue cloth: his watch ticking, the faint crackle of his starched shirt, the soft&#160;<br/>
sound of his breathing.<br/>
“Your stomach’s growling,” I said.<br/>
“I know it,” he said.<br/>
“You better take some soda.”<br/>
“I will,” he said.<br/>
“Atticus, is all this behavin‘ an’ stuff gonna make things different? I mean are you<br/>
—?”<br/>
I felt his hand on the back of my head. “Don’t you worry about anything,” he&#160;<br/>
said. “It’s not time to worry.” When I heard that, I knew he had come back to us.&#160;<br/>
The blood in my legs began to flow again, and I raised my head. “You really want&#160;<br/>
us to do all that? I can’t remember everything Finches are supposed to do…”<br/>
“I don’t want you to remember it. Forget it.”<br/>
He went to the door and out of the room, shutting the door behind him. He nearly&#160;<br/>
slammed it, but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly. As Jem and&#160;<br/>
I stared, the door opened again and Atticus peered around. His eyebrows were&#160;<br/>
raised, his glasses had slipped. “Get more like Cousin Joshua every day, don’t I?&#160;<br/>
Do you think I’ll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=136></a>I know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man. It takes a&#160;<br/>
woman to do that kind of work.<br/>

<b>Chapter 14</b><br/>
Although we heard no more about the Finch family from Aunt Alexandra, we&#160;<br/>
heard plenty from the town. On Saturdays, armed with our nickels, when Jem&#160;<br/>
permitted me to accompany him (he was now positively allergic to my presence&#160;<br/>
when in public), we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds&#160;<br/>
and sometimes hear, “There’s his chillun,” or, “Yonder’s some Finches.” Turning&#160;<br/>
to face our accusers, we would see only a couple of farmers studying the enema&#160;<br/>
bags in the Mayco Drugstore window. Or two dumpy countrywomen in straw hats&#160;<br/>
sitting in a Hoover cart.<br/>
“They c’n go loose and rape up the countryside for all of ‘em who run this county&#160;<br/>
care,” was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman&#160;<br/>
when he passed us. Which reminded me that I had a question to ask Atticus.<br/>
“What’s rape?” I asked him that night.<br/>
Atticus looked around from behind his paper. He was in his chair by the window.&#160;<br/>
As we grew older, Jem and I thought it generous to allow Atticus thirty minutes to&#160;<br/>
himself after supper.<br/>
He sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without&#160;<br/>
consent.<br/>
“Well if that’s all it is why did Calpurnia dry me up when I asked her what it&#160;<br/>
was?”<br/>
Atticus looked pensive. “What’s that again?”<br/>
“Well, I asked Calpurnia comin‘ from church that day what it was and she said&#160;<br/>
ask you but I forgot to and now I’m askin’ you.”<br/>
His paper was now in his lap. “Again, please,” he said.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=137></a>I told him in detail about our trip to church with Calpurnia. Atticus seemed to&#160;<br/>
enjoy it, but Aunt Alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put&#160;<br/>
down her embroidery and stared at us.<br/>
“You all were coming back from Calpurnia’s church that Sunday?”<br/>
Jem said, “Yessum, she took us.”<br/>
I remembered something. “Yessum, and she promised me I could come out to her&#160;<br/>
house some afternoon. Atticus. I’ll go next Sunday if it’s all right, can I? Cal said&#160;<br/>
she’d come get me if you were off in the car.”<br/>
“You may&#160;<i>not</i>.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra said it. I wheeled around, startled, then turned back to Atticus in&#160;<br/>
time to catch his swift glance at her, but it was too late. I said, “I didn’t ask you!”<br/>
For a big man, Atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone I&#160;<br/>
ever knew. He was on his feet. “Apologize to your aunt,” he said.<br/>
“I didn’t ask her, I asked you—”<br/>
Atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye. His voice&#160;<br/>
was deadly: “First, apologize to your aunt.”<br/>
“I’m sorry, Aunty,” I muttered.<br/>
“Now then,” he said. “Let’s get this clear: you do as Calpurnia tells you, you do&#160;<br/>
as I tell you, and as long as your aunt’s in this house, you will do as she tells you.&#160;<br/>
Understand?”<br/>
I understood, pondered a while, and concluded that the only way I could retire&#160;<br/>
with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom, where I stayed long enough to&#160;<br/>
make them think I had to go. Returning, I lingered in the hall to hear a fierce&#160;<br/>
discussion going on in the livingroom. Through the door I could see Jem on the&#160;<br/>
sofa with a football magazine in front of his face, his head turning as if its pages&#160;<br/>
contained a live tennis match.<br/>
“…you’ve got to do something about her,” Aunty was saying. “You’ve let things&#160;<br/>
go on too long, Atticus, too long.”<br/>
“I don’t see any harm in letting her go out there. Cal’d look after her there as well&#160;<br/>
as she does here.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=138></a>Who was the “her” they were talking about? My heart sank: me. I felt the starched&#160;<br/>
walls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me, and for the second time in&#160;<br/>
my life I thought of running away. Immediately.<br/>
“Atticus, it’s all right to be soft-hearted, you’re an easy man, but you have a&#160;<br/>
daughter to think of. A daughter who’s growing up.”<br/>
“That’s what I am thinking of.”<br/>
“And don’t try to get around it. You’ve got to face it sooner or later and it might&#160;<br/>
as well be tonight. We don’t need her now.”<br/>
Atticus’s voice was even: “Alexandra, Calpurnia’s not leaving this house until she&#160;<br/>
wants to. You may think otherwise, but I couldn’t have got along without her all&#160;<br/>
these years. She’s a faithful member of this family and you’ll simply have to&#160;<br/>
accept things the way they are. Besides, sister, I don’t want you working your&#160;<br/>
head off for us—you’ve no reason to do that. We still need Cal as much as we&#160;<br/>
ever did.”<br/>
“But Atticus—”<br/>
“Besides, I don’t think the children’ve suffered one bit from her having brought&#160;<br/>
them up. If anything, she’s been harder on them in some ways than a mother&#160;<br/>
would have been… she’s never let them get away with anything, she’s never&#160;<br/>
indulged them the way most colored nurses do. She tried to bring them up&#160;<br/>
according to her lights, and Cal’s lights are pretty good—and another thing, the&#160;<br/>
children love her.”<br/>
I breathed again. It wasn’t me, it was only Calpurnia they were talking about.&#160;<br/>
Revived, I entered the livingroom. Atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and&#160;<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was worrying her embroidery. Punk, punk, punk, her needle&#160;<br/>
broke the taut circle. She stopped, and pulled the cloth tighter: punk-punk-punk.&#160;<br/>
She was furious.<br/>
Jem got up and padded across the rug. He motioned me to follow. He led me to&#160;<br/>
his room and closed the door. His face was grave.<br/>
“They’ve been fussing, Scout.”<br/>
Jem and I fussed a great deal these days, but I had never heard of or seen anyone&#160;<br/>
quarrel with Atticus. It was not a comfortable sight.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=139></a>“Scout, try not to antagonize Aunty, hear?”<br/>
Atticus’s remarks were still rankling, which made me miss the request in Jem’s&#160;<br/>
question. My feathers rose again. “You tryin‘ to tell me what to do?”<br/>
“Naw, it’s—he’s got a lot on his mind now, without us worrying him.”<br/>
“Like what?” Atticus didn’t appear to have anything especially on his mind.<br/>
“It’s this Tom Robinson case that’s worryin‘ him to death—”<br/>
I said Atticus didn’t worry about anything. Besides, the case never bothered us&#160;<br/>
except about once a week and then it didn’t last.<br/>
“That’s because you can’t hold something in your mind but a little while,” said&#160;<br/>
Jem. “It’s different with grown folks, we—”<br/>
His maddening superiority was unbearable these days. He didn’t want to do&#160;<br/>
anything but read and go off by himself. Still, everything he read he passed along&#160;<br/>
to me, but with this difference: formerly, because he thought I’d like it; now, for&#160;<br/>
my edification and instruction.<br/>
“Jee crawling hova, Jem! Who do you think you are?”<br/>
“Now I mean it, Scout, you antagonize Aunty and I’ll—I’ll spank you.”<br/>
With that, I was gone. “You damn morphodite, I’ll kill you!” He was sitting on&#160;<br/>
the bed, and it was easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth. He&#160;<br/>
slapped me and I tried another left, but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling&#160;<br/>
on the floor. It nearly knocked the breath out of me, but it didn’t matter because I&#160;<br/>
knew he was fighting, he was fighting me back. We were still equals.<br/>
“Ain’t so high and mighty now, are you!” I screamed, sailing in again. He was&#160;<br/>
still on the bed and I couldn’t get a firm stance, so I threw myself at him as hard&#160;<br/>
as I could, hitting, pulling, pinching, gouging. What had begun as a fist-fight&#160;<br/>
became a brawl. We were still struggling when Atticus separated us.<br/>
“That’s all,” he said. “Both of you go to bed right now.”<br/>
“Taah!” I said at Jem. He was being sent to bed at my bedtime.<br/>
“Who started it?” asked Atticus, in resignation.<br/>
“Jem did. He was tryin‘ to tell me what to do. I don’t have to mind&#160;<i>him</i>&#160;now, do&#160;<br/>
I?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=140></a>Atticus smiled. “Let’s leave it at this: you mind Jem whenever he can make you.&#160;<br/>
Fair enough?”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was present but silent, and when she went down the hall with&#160;<br/>
Atticus we heard her say, “…just one of the things I’ve been telling you about,” a&#160;<br/>
phrase that united us again.<br/>
Ours were adjoining rooms; as I shut the door between them Jem said, “Night,&#160;<br/>
Scout.”<br/>
“Night,” I murmured, picking my way across the room to turn on the light. As I&#160;<br/>
passed the bed I stepped on something warm, resilient, and rather smooth. It was&#160;<br/>
not quite like hard rubber, and I had the sensation that it was alive. I also heard it&#160;<br/>
move.<br/>
I switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed. Whatever I had stepped&#160;<br/>
on was gone. I tapped on Jem’s door.<br/>
“What,” he said.<br/>
“How does a snake feel?”<br/>
“Sort of rough. Cold. Dusty. Why?”<br/>
“I think there’s one under my bed. Can you come look?”<br/>
“Are you bein‘ funny?” Jem opened the door. He was in his pajama bottoms. I&#160;<br/>
noticed not without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his&#160;<br/>
mouth. When he saw I meant what I said, he said, “If you think I’m gonna put my&#160;<br/>
face down to a snake you’ve got another think comin’. Hold on a minute.”<br/>
He went to the kitchen and fetched the broom. “You better get up on the bed,” he&#160;<br/>
said.<br/>
“You reckon it’s really one?” I asked. This was an occasion. Our houses had no&#160;<br/>
cellars; they were built on stone blocks a few feet above the ground, and the entry&#160;<br/>
of reptiles was not unknown but was not commonplace. Miss Rachel Haverford’s&#160;<br/>
excuse for a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that she never got over the&#160;<br/>
fright of finding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet, on her washing, when she&#160;<br/>
went to hang up her negligee.<br/>
Jem made a tentative swipe under the bed. I looked over the foot to see if a snake&#160;<br/>
would come out. None did. Jem made a deeper swipe.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=141></a>“Do snakes grunt?”<br/>
“It ain’t a snake,” Jem said. “It’s somebody.”<br/>
Suddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed. Jem raised the broom&#160;<br/>
and missed Dill’s head by an inch when it appeared.<br/>
“God Almighty.” Jem’s voice was reverent.<br/>
We watched Dill emerge by degrees. He was a tight fit. He stood up and eased his&#160;<br/>
shoulders, turned his feet in their ankle sockets, rubbed the back of his neck. His&#160;<br/>
circulation restored, he said, “Hey.”<br/>
Jem petitioned God again. I was speechless.<br/>
“I’m ‘bout to perish,” said Dill. “Got anything to eat?”<br/>
In a dream, I went to the kitchen. I brought him back some milk and half a pan of&#160;<br/>
corn bread left over from supper. Dill devoured it, chewing with his front teeth, as&#160;<br/>
was his custom.<br/>
I finally found my voice. “How’d you get here?”<br/>
By an involved route. Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative: having been&#160;<br/>
bound in chains and left to die in the basement (there were basements in&#160;<br/>
Meridian) by his new father, who disliked him, and secretly kept alive on raw&#160;<br/>
field peas by a passing farmer who heard his cries for help (the good man poked a&#160;<br/>
bushel pod by pod through the ventilator), Dill worked himself free by pulling the&#160;<br/>
chains from the wall. Still in wrist manacles, he wandered two miles out of&#160;<br/>
Meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged&#160;<br/>
to wash the camel. He traveled with the show all over Mississippi until his&#160;<br/>
infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County, Alabama, just&#160;<br/>
across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way.<br/>
“How’d you get here?” asked Jem.<br/>
He had taken thirteen dollars from his mother’s purse, caught the nine o’clock&#160;<br/>
from Meridian and got off at Maycomb Junction. He had walked ten or eleven of&#160;<br/>
the fourteen miles to Maycomb, off the highway in the scrub bushes lest the&#160;<br/>
authorities be seeking him, and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to&#160;<br/>
the backboard of a cotton wagon. He had been under the bed for two hours, he&#160;<br/>
thought; he had heard us in the diningroom, and the clink of forks on plates nearly&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=142></a>drove him crazy. He thought Jem and I would never go to bed; he had considered&#160;<br/>
emerging and helping me beat Jem, as Jem had grown far taller, but he knew Mr.&#160;<br/>
Finch would break it up soon, so he thought it best to stay where he was. He was&#160;<br/>
worn out, dirty beyond belief, and home.<br/>
“They must not know you’re here,” said Jem. “We’d know if they were lookin‘&#160;<br/>
for you…”<br/>
“Think they’re still searchin‘ all the picture shows in Meridian.” Dill grinned.<br/>
“You oughta let your mother know where you are,” said Jem. “You oughta let her&#160;<br/>
know you’re here…”<br/>
Dill’s eyes flickered at Jem, and Jem looked at the floor. Then he rose and broke&#160;<br/>
the remaining code of our childhood. He went out of the room and down the hall.&#160;<br/>
“Atticus,” his voice was distant, “can you come here a minute, sir?”<br/>
Beneath its sweat-streaked dirt Dill’s face went white. I felt sick. Atticus was in&#160;<br/>
the doorway.<br/>
He came to the middle of the room and stood with his hands in his pockets,&#160;<br/>
looking down at Dill.<br/>
I finally found my voice: “It’s okay, Dill. When he wants you to know somethin‘,&#160;<br/>
he tells you.”<br/>
Dill looked at me. “I mean it’s all right,” I said. “You know he wouldn’t bother&#160;<br/>
you, you know you ain’t scared of Atticus.”<br/>
“I’m not scared…” Dill muttered.<br/>
“Just hungry, I’ll bet.” Atticus’s voice had its usual pleasant dryness. “Scout, we&#160;<br/>
can do better than a pan of cold corn bread, can’t we? You fill this fellow up and&#160;<br/>
when I get back we’ll see what we can see.”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, don’t tell Aunt Rachel, don’t make me go back,&#160;<i>please</i>&#160;sir! I’ll run off&#160;<br/>
again—!”<br/>
“Whoa, son,” said Atticus. “Nobody’s about to make you go anywhere but to bed&#160;<br/>
pretty soon. I’m just going over to tell Miss Rachel you’re here and ask her if you&#160;<br/>
could spend the night with us—you’d like that, wouldn’t you? And for goodness’&#160;<br/>
sake put some of the county back where it belongs, the soil erosion’s bad enough&#160;<br/>
as it is.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=143></a>Dill stared at my father’s retreating figure.<br/>
“He’s tryin‘ to be funny,” I said. “He means take a bath. See there, I told you he&#160;<br/>
wouldn’t bother you.”<br/>
Jem was standing in a corner of the room, looking like the traitor he was. “Dill, I&#160;<br/>
had to tell him,” he said. “You can’t run three hundred miles off without your&#160;<br/>
mother knowin‘.”<br/>
We left him without a word.<br/>
Dill ate, and ate, and ate. He hadn’t eaten since last night. He used all his money&#160;<br/>
for a ticket, boarded the train as he had done many times, coolly chatted with the&#160;<br/>
conductor, to whom Dill was a familiar sight, but he had not the nerve to invoke&#160;<br/>
the rule on small children traveling a distance alone if you’ve lost your money the&#160;<br/>
conductor will lend you enough for dinner and your father will pay him back at&#160;<br/>
the end of the line.<br/>
Dill made his way through the leftovers and was reaching for a can of pork and&#160;<br/>
beans in the pantry when Miss Rachel’s Do-oo Je-sus went off in the hall. He&#160;<br/>
shivered like a rabbit.<br/>
He bore with fortitude her Wait Till I Get You Home, Your Folks Are Out of&#160;<br/>
Their Minds Worryin‘, was quite calm during That’s All the Harris in You&#160;<br/>
Coming Out, smiled at her Reckon You Can Stay One Night, and returned the&#160;<br/>
hug at long last bestowed upon him.<br/>
Atticus pushed up his glasses and rubbed his face.<br/>
“Your father’s tired,” said Aunt Alexandra, her first words in hours, it seemed.&#160;<br/>
She had been there, but I suppose struck dumb most of the time. “You children&#160;<br/>
get to bed now.”<br/>
We left them in the diningroom, Atticus still mopping his face. “From rape to riot&#160;<br/>
to runaways,” we heard him chuckle. “I wonder what the next two hours will&#160;<br/>
bring.”<br/>
Since things appeared to have worked out pretty well, Dill and I decided to be&#160;<br/>
civil to Jem. Besides, Dill had to sleep with him so we might as well speak to him.<br/>
I put on my pajamas, read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep&#160;<br/>
my eyes open. Dill and Jem were quiet; when I turned off my reading lamp there&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=144></a>was no strip of light under the door to Jem’s room.<br/>
I must have slept a long time, for when I was punched awake the room was dim&#160;<br/>
with the light of the setting moon.<br/>
“Move over, Scout.”<br/>
“He thought he had to,” I mumbled. “Don’t stay mad with him.”<br/>
Dill got in bed beside me. “I ain’t,” he said. “I just wanted to sleep with you. Are&#160;<br/>
you waked up?”<br/>
By this time I was, but lazily so. “Why’d you do it?”<br/>
No answer. “I said why’d you run off? Was he really hateful like you said?”<br/>
“Naw…”<br/>
“Didn’t you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna?”<br/>
“He just said we would. We never did.”<br/>
I raised up on my elbow, facing Dill’s outline. “It’s no reason to run off. They&#160;<br/>
don’t get around to doin‘ what they say they’re gonna do half the time…”<br/>
“That wasn’t it, he—they just wasn’t interested in me.”<br/>
This was the weirdest reason for flight I had ever heard. “How come?”<br/>
“Well, they stayed gone all the time, and when they were home, even, they’d get&#160;<br/>
off in a room by themselves.”<br/>
“What’d they do in there?”<br/>
“Nothin‘, just sittin’ and readin‘—but they didn’t want me with ’em.”<br/>
I pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up. “You know something? I was&#160;<br/>
fixin‘ to run off tonight because there they all were. You don’t want ’em around&#160;<br/>
you all the time, Dill—”<br/>
Dill breathed his patient breath, a half-sigh.<br/>
“—good night, Atticus’s gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in the&#160;<br/>
legislature and I don’t know what—you don’t want ‘em around all the time, Dill,&#160;<br/>
you couldn’t do anything if they were.”<br/>
“That’s not it.”<br/>
As Dill explained, I found myself wondering what life would be if Jem were&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=145></a>different, even from what he was now; what I would do if Atticus did not feel the&#160;<br/>
necessity of my presence, help and advice. Why, he couldn’t get along a day&#160;<br/>
without me. Even Calpurnia couldn’t get along unless I was there. They needed&#160;<br/>
me.<br/>
“Dill, you ain’t telling me right—your folks couldn’t do without you. They must&#160;<br/>
be just mean to you. Tell you what to do about that—”<br/>
Dill’s voice went on steadily in the darkness: “The thing is, what I’m tryin‘ to say&#160;<br/>
is—they do get on a lot better without me, I can’t help them any. They ain’t mean.&#160;<br/>
They buy me everything I want, but it’s now—you’ve-got-it-go-play-with-it.&#160;<br/>
You’ve got a roomful of things. I-got-you-that-book-so-go-read-it.” Dill tried to&#160;<br/>
deepen his voice. “You’re not a boy. Boys get out and play baseball with other&#160;<br/>
boys, they don’t hang around the house worryin’ their folks.”<br/>
Dill’s voice was his own again: “Oh, they ain’t mean. They kiss you and hug you&#160;<br/>
good night and good mornin‘ and good-bye and tell you they love you—Scout,&#160;<br/>
let’s get us a baby.”<br/>
“Where?”<br/>
There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy&#160;<br/>
island where all these babies were; you could order one—<br/>
“That’s a lie. Aunty said God drops ‘em down the chimney. At least that’s what I&#160;<br/>
think she said.” For once, Aunty’s diction had not been too clear.<br/>
“Well that ain’t so. You get babies from each other. But there’s this man, too—he&#160;<br/>
has all these babies just waitin‘ to wake up, he breathes life into ’em…”<br/>
Dill was off again. Beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head. He could&#160;<br/>
read two books to my one, but he preferred the magic of his own inventions. He&#160;<br/>
could add and subtract faster than lightning, but he preferred his own twilight&#160;<br/>
world, a world where babies slept, waiting to be gathered like morning lilies. He&#160;<br/>
was slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him, but in the quietness&#160;<br/>
of his foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown&#160;<br/>
doors.<br/>
“Dill?”<br/>
“Mm?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=146></a>“Why do you reckon Boo Radley’s never run off?”<br/>
Dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me.<br/>
“Maybe he doesn’t have anywhere to run off to…”<br/>

<b>Chapter 15</b><br/>
After many telephone calls, much pleading on behalf of the defendant, and a long&#160;<br/>
forgiving letter from his mother, it was decided that Dill could stay. We had a&#160;<br/>
week of peace together. After that, little, it seemed. A nightmare was upon us.<br/>
It began one evening after supper. Dill was over; Aunt Alexandra was in her chair&#160;<br/>
in the corner, Atticus was in his; Jem and I were on the floor reading. It had been&#160;<br/>
a placid week: I had minded Aunty; Jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped&#160;<br/>
Dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it; Dill had hit upon a foolproof plan&#160;<br/>
to make Boo Radley come out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops&#160;<br/>
from the back door to the front yard and he’d follow it, like an ant). There was a&#160;<br/>
knock on the front door, Jem answered it and said it was Mr. Heck Tate.<br/>
“Well, ask him to come in,” said Atticus.<br/>
“I already did. There’s some men outside in the yard, they want you to come out.”<br/>
In Maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons:&#160;<br/>
death and politics. I wondered who had died. Jem and I went to the front door, but&#160;<br/>
Atticus called, “Go back in the house.”<br/>
Jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen.&#160;<br/>
Aunt Alexandra protested. “Just for a second, Aunty, let’s see who it is,” he said.<br/>
Dill and I took another window. A crowd of men was standing around Atticus.&#160;<br/>
They all seemed to be talking at once.<br/>
“…movin‘ him to the county jail tomorrow,” Mr. Tate was saying, “I don’t look&#160;<br/>
for any trouble, but I can’t guarantee there won’t be any…”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=147></a>“Don’t be foolish, Heck,” Atticus said. “This is Maycomb.”<br/>
“…said I was just uneasy.”<br/>
“Heck, we’ve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure there’s&#160;<br/>
nothing to be uneasy about. This is Saturday,” Atticus said. “Trial’ll probably be&#160;<br/>
Monday. You can keep him one night, can’t you? I don’t think anybody in&#160;<br/>
Maycomb’ll begrudge me a client, with times this hard.”<br/>
There was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when Mr. Link Deas said,&#160;<br/>
“Nobody around here’s up to anything, it’s that Old Sarum bunch I’m worried&#160;<br/>
about… can’t you get a—what is it, Heck?”<br/>
“Change of venue,” said Mr. Tate. “Not much point in that, now is it?”<br/>
Atticus said something inaudible. I turned to Jem, who waved me to silence.<br/>
“—besides,” Atticus was saying, “you’re not scared of that crowd, are you?”<br/>
“…know how they do when they get shinnied up.”<br/>
“They don’t usually drink on Sunday, they go to church most of the day…”&#160;<br/>
Atticus said.<br/>
“This is a special occasion, though…” someone said.<br/>
They murmured and buzzed until Aunty said if Jem didn’t turn on the livingroom&#160;<br/>
lights he would disgrace the family. Jem didn’t hear her.<br/>
“—don’t see why you touched it in the first place,” Mr. Link Deas was saying.&#160;<br/>
“You’ve got everything to lose from this, Atticus. I mean everything.”<br/>
“Do you really think so?”<br/>
This was Atticus’s dangerous question. “Do you really think you want to move&#160;<br/>
there, Scout?” Bam, bam, bam, and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men.&#160;<br/>
“Do you really think that, son? Then read this.” Jem would struggle the rest of an&#160;<br/>
evening through the speeches of Henry W. Grady.<br/>
“Link, that boy might go to the chair, but he’s not going till the truth’s told.”&#160;<br/>
Atticus’s voice was even. “And you know what the truth is.”<br/>
There was a murmur among the group of men, made more ominous when Atticus&#160;<br/>
moved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him.<br/>
Suddenly Jem screamed, “Atticus, the telephone’s ringing!”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=148></a>The men jumped a little and scattered; they were people we saw every day:&#160;<br/>
merchants, in-town farmers; Dr. Reynolds was there; so was Mr. Avery.<br/>
“Well, answer it, son,” called Atticus.<br/>
Laughter broke them up. When Atticus switched on the overhead light in the&#160;<br/>
livingroom he found Jem at the window, pale except for the vivid mark of the&#160;<br/>
screen on his nose.<br/>
“Why on earth are you all sitting in the dark?” he asked.<br/>
Jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper. I sometimes think&#160;<br/>
Atticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind The Mobile&#160;<br/>
Register,&#160;<i>The Birmingham News</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>The Montgomery Advertiser</i>.<br/>
“They were after you, weren’t they?” Jem went to him. “They wanted to get you,&#160;<br/>
didn’t they?”<br/>
Atticus lowered the paper and gazed at Jem. “What have you been reading?” he&#160;<br/>
asked. Then he said gently, “No son, those were our friends.”<br/>
“It wasn’t a—a gang?” Jem was looking from the corners of his eyes.<br/>
Atticus tried to stifle a smile but didn’t make it. “No, we don’t have mobs and that&#160;<br/>
nonsense in Maycomb. I’ve never heard of a gang in Maycomb.”<br/>
“Ku Klux got after some Catholics one time.”<br/>
“Never heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either,” said Atticus, “you’re&#160;<br/>
confusing that with something else. Way back about nineteen-twenty there was a&#160;<br/>
Klan, but it was a political organization more than anything. Besides, they&#160;<br/>
couldn’t find anybody to scare. They paraded by Mr. Sam Levy’s house one&#160;<br/>
night, but Sam just stood on his porch and told ‘em things had come to a pretty&#160;<br/>
pass, he’d sold ’em the very sheets on their backs. Sam made ‘em so ashamed of&#160;<br/>
themselves they went away.”<br/>
The Levy family met all criteria for being Fine Folks: they did the best they could&#160;<br/>
with the sense they had, and they had been living on the same plot of ground in&#160;<br/>
Maycomb for five generations.<br/>
“The Ku Klux’s gone,” said Atticus. “It’ll never come back.”<br/>
I walked home with Dill and returned in time to overhear Atticus saying to Aunty,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=149></a>“…in favor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody, but not for preserving&#160;<br/>
polite fiction at the expense of human life,” a pronouncement that made me&#160;<br/>
suspect they had been fussing again.<br/>
I sought Jem and found him in his room, on the bed deep in thought. “Have they&#160;<br/>
been at it?” I asked.<br/>
“Sort of. She won’t let him alone about Tom Robinson. She almost said Atticus&#160;<br/>
was disgracin‘ the family. Scout… I’m scared.”<br/>
“Scared’a what?”<br/>
“Scared about Atticus. Somebody might hurt him.” Jem preferred to remain&#160;<br/>
mysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone.<br/>
Next day was Sunday. In the interval between Sunday School and Church when&#160;<br/>
the congregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the yard with another&#160;<br/>
knot of men. Mr. Heck Tate was present, and I wondered if he had seen the light.&#160;<br/>
He never went to church. Even Mr. Underwood was there. Mr. Underwood had&#160;<br/>
no use for any organization but&#160;<i>The Maycomb Tribune</i>, of which he was the sole&#160;<br/>
owner, editor, and printer. His days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed&#160;<br/>
himself occasionally from an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. He rarely&#160;<br/>
gathered news; people brought it to him. It was said that he made up every edition&#160;<br/>
of&#160;<i>The Maycomb Tribune</i>&#160;out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype.&#160;<br/>
This was believable. Something must have been up to haul Mr. Underwood out.<br/>
I caught Atticus coming in the door, and he said that they’d moved Tom Robinson&#160;<br/>
to the Maycomb jail. He also said, more to himself than to me, that if they’d kept&#160;<br/>
him there in the first place there wouldn’t have been any fuss. I watched him take&#160;<br/>
his seat on the third row from the front, and I heard him rumble, “Nearer my God&#160;<br/>
to thee,” some notes behind the rest of us. He never sat with Aunty, Jem and me.&#160;<br/>
He liked to be by himself in church.<br/>
The fake peace that prevailed on Sundays was made more irritating by Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra’s presence. Atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner, where&#160;<br/>
if we sometimes looked in on him, we would find him sitting back in his swivel&#160;<br/>
chair reading. Aunt Alexandra composed herself for a two-hour nap and dared us&#160;<br/>
to make any noise in the yard, the neighborhood was resting. Jem in his old age&#160;<br/>
had taken to his room with a stack of football magazines. So Dill and I spent our&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=150></a>Sundays creeping around in Deer’s Pasture.<br/>
Shooting on Sundays was prohibited, so Dill and I kicked Jem’s football around&#160;<br/>
the pasture for a while, which was no fun. Dill asked if I’d like to have a poke at&#160;<br/>
Boo Radley. I said I didn’t think it’d be nice to bother him, and spent the rest of&#160;<br/>
the afternoon filling Dill in on last winter’s events. He was considerably&#160;<br/>
impressed.<br/>
We parted at suppertime, and after our meal Jem and I were settling down to a&#160;<br/>
routine evening, when Atticus did something that interested us: he came into the&#160;<br/>
livingroom carrying a long electrical extension cord. There was a light bulb on the&#160;<br/>
end.<br/>
“I’m going out for a while,” he said. “You folks’ll be in bed when I come back, so&#160;<br/>
I’ll say good night now.”<br/>
With that, he put his hat on and went out the back door.<br/>
“He’s takin‘ the car,” said Jem.<br/>
Our father had a few peculiarities: one was, he never ate desserts; another was&#160;<br/>
that he liked to walk. As far back as I could remember, there was always a&#160;<br/>
Chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse, and Atticus put many miles on it&#160;<br/>
in business trips, but in Maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a&#160;<br/>
day, covering about two miles. He said his only exercise was walking. In&#160;<br/>
Maycomb, if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind, it was correct&#160;<br/>
to believe one’s mind incapable of definite purpose.<br/>
Later on, I bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a book when I&#160;<br/>
heard Jem rattling around in his room. His go-to-bed noises were so familiar to&#160;<br/>
me that I knocked on his door: “Why ain’t you going to bed?”<br/>
“I’m goin‘ downtown for a while.” He was changing his pants.<br/>
“Why? It’s almost ten o’clock, Jem.”<br/>
He knew it, but he was going anyway.<br/>
“Then I’m goin‘ with you. If you say no you’re not, I’m goin’ anyway, hear?”<br/>
Jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home, and I suppose he&#160;<br/>
thought a fight would antagonize Aunty, so he gave in with little grace.<br/>
I dressed quickly. We waited until Aunty’s light went out, and we walked quietly&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=151></a>down the back steps. There was no moon tonight.<br/>
“Dill’ll wanta come,” I whispered.<br/>
“So he will,” said Jem gloomily.<br/>
We leaped over the driveway wall, cut through Miss Rachel’s side yard and went&#160;<br/>
to Dill’s window. Jem whistled bob-white. Dill’s face appeared at the screen,&#160;<br/>
disappeared, and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out. An&#160;<br/>
old campaigner, he did not speak until we were on the sidewalk. “What’s up?”<br/>
“Jem’s got the look-arounds,” an affliction Calpurnia said all boys caught at his&#160;<br/>
age.<br/>
“I’ve just got this feeling,” Jem said, “just this feeling.”<br/>
We went by Mrs. Dubose’s house, standing empty and shuttered, her camellias&#160;<br/>
grown up in weeds and johnson grass. There were eight more houses to the post&#160;<br/>
office corner.<br/>
The south side of the square was deserted. Giant monkey-puzzle bushes bristled&#160;<br/>
on each corner, and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street&#160;<br/>
lights. A light shone in the county toilet, otherwise that side of the courthouse was&#160;<br/>
dark. A larger square of stores surrounded the courthouse square; dim lights&#160;<br/>
burned from deep within them.<br/>
Atticus’s office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice, but after&#160;<br/>
several years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the Maycomb Bank building.&#160;<br/>
When we rounded the corner of the square, we saw the car parked in front of the&#160;<br/>
bank. “He’s in there,” said Jem.<br/>
But he wasn’t. His office was reached by a long hallway. Looking down the hall,&#160;<br/>
we should have seen&#160;<i>Atticus Finch, Attorney-at-Law</i>&#160;in small sober letters against&#160;<br/>
the light from behind his door. It was dark.<br/>
Jem peered in the bank door to make sure. He turned the knob. The door was&#160;<br/>
locked. “Let’s go up the street. Maybe he’s visitin‘ Mr. Underwood.”<br/>
Mr. Underwood not only ran&#160;<i>The Maycomb Tribune</i>&#160;office, he lived in it. That is,&#160;<br/>
above it. He covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his&#160;<br/>
upstairs window. The office building was on the northwest corner of the square,&#160;<br/>
and to reach it we had to pass the jail.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=152></a>The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the county’s buildings.&#160;<br/>
Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St. Clair might have designed. It&#160;<br/>
was certainly someone’s dream. Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced&#160;<br/>
stores and steep-roofed houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke&#160;<br/>
one cell wide and two cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying&#160;<br/>
buttresses. Its fantasy was heightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel&#160;<br/>
bars at its ecclesiastical windows. It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged&#160;<br/>
between Tyndal’s Hardware Store and&#160;<i>The Maycomb Tribune office</i>. The jail was&#160;<br/>
Maycomb’s only conversation piece: its detractors said it looked like a Victorian&#160;<br/>
privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look, and no&#160;<br/>
stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers.<br/>
As we walked up the sidewalk, we saw a solitary light burning in the distance.&#160;<br/>
“That’s funny,” said Jem, “jail doesn’t have an outside light.”<br/>
“Looks like it’s over the door,” said Dill.<br/>
A long extension cord ran between the bars of a second-floor window and down&#160;<br/>
the side of the building. In the light from its bare bulb, Atticus was sitting propped&#160;<br/>
against the front door. He was sitting in one of his office chairs, and he was&#160;<br/>
reading, oblivious of the nightbugs dancing over his head.<br/>
I made to run, but Jem caught me. “Don’t go to him,” he said, “he might not like&#160;<br/>
it. He’s all right, let’s go home. I just wanted to see where he was.”<br/>
We were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from&#160;<br/>
the Meridian highway, moving slowly in a line. They went around the square,&#160;<br/>
passed the bank building, and stopped in front of the jail.<br/>
Nobody got out. We saw Atticus look up from his newspaper. He closed it, folded&#160;<br/>
it deliberately, dropped it in his lap, and pushed his hat to the back of his head. He&#160;<br/>
seemed to be expecting them.<br/>
“Come on,” whispered Jem. We streaked across the square, across the street, until&#160;<br/>
we were in the shelter of the Jitney Jungle door. Jem peeked up the sidewalk. “We&#160;<br/>
can get closer,” he said. We ran to Tyndal’s Hardware door—near enough, at the&#160;<br/>
same time discreet.<br/>
In ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance as lights&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=153></a>revealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door. Atticus remained where he&#160;<br/>
was. The men hid him from view.<br/>
“He in there, Mr. Finch?” a man said.<br/>
“He is,” we heard Atticus answer, “and he’s asleep. Don’t wake him up.”<br/>
In obedience to my father, there followed what I later realized was a sickeningly&#160;<br/>
comic aspect of an unfunny situation: the men talked in near-whispers.<br/>
“You know what we want,” another man said. “Get aside from the door, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Finch.”<br/>
“You can turn around and go home again, Walter,” Atticus said pleasantly. “Heck&#160;<br/>
Tate’s around somewhere.”<br/>
“The hell he is,” said another man. “Heck’s bunch’s so deep in the woods they&#160;<br/>
won’t get out till mornin‘.”<br/>
“Indeed? Why so?”<br/>
“Called ‘em off on a snipe hunt,” was the succinct answer. “Didn’t you think&#160;<br/>
a’that, Mr. Finch?”<br/>
“Thought about it, but didn’t believe it. Well then,” my father’s voice was still the&#160;<br/>
same, “that changes things, doesn’t it?”<br/>
“It do,” another deep voice said. Its owner was a shadow.<br/>
“Do you really think so?”<br/>
This was the second time I heard Atticus ask that question in two days, and it&#160;<br/>
meant somebody’s man would get jumped. This was too good to miss. I broke&#160;<br/>
away from Jem and ran as fast as I could to Atticus.<br/>
Jem shrieked and tried to catch me, but I had a lead on him and Dill. I pushed my&#160;<br/>
way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of light.<br/>
“H-ey, Atticus!”<br/>
I thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy. A flash of&#160;<br/>
plain fear was going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill and Jem wriggled into&#160;<br/>
the light.<br/>
There was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about, and when I glanced around&#160;<br/>
I discovered that these men were strangers. They were not the people I saw last&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=154></a>night. Hot embarrassment shot through me: I had leaped triumphantly into a ring&#160;<br/>
of people I had never seen before.<br/>
Atticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old man. He put&#160;<br/>
the newspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases with lingering fingers.&#160;<br/>
They were trembling a little.<br/>
“Go home, Jem,” he said. “Take Scout and Dill home.”<br/>
We were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to Atticus’s&#160;<br/>
instructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking of budging.<br/>
“Go home, I said.”<br/>
Jem shook his head. As Atticus’s fists went to his hips, so did Jem’s, and as they&#160;<br/>
faced each other I could see little resemblance between them: Jem’s soft brown&#160;<br/>
hair and eyes, his oval face and snug-fitting ears were our mother’s, contrasting&#160;<br/>
oddly with Atticus’s graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were&#160;<br/>
somehow alike. Mutual defiance made them alike.<br/>
“Son, I said go home.”<br/>
Jem shook his head.<br/>
“I’ll send him home,” a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by the collar.&#160;<br/>
He yanked Jem nearly off his feet.<br/>
“Don’t you touch him!” I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to&#160;<br/>
see him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high.<br/>
“That’ll do, Scout.” Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. “Don’t kick folks. No<br/>
—” he said, as I was pleading justification.<br/>
“Ain’t nobody gonna do Jem that way,” I said.<br/>
“All right, Mr. Finch, get ‘em outa here,” someone growled. “You got fifteen&#160;<br/>
seconds to get ’em outa here.”<br/>
In the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make Jem mind him.&#160;<br/>
“I ain’t going,” was his steady answer to Atticus’s threats, requests, and finally,&#160;<br/>
“Please Jem, take them home.”<br/>
I was getting a bit tired of that, but felt Jem had his own reasons for doing as he&#160;<br/>
did, in view of his prospects once Atticus did get him home. I looked around the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=155></a>crowd. It was a summer’s night, but the men were dressed, most of them, in&#160;<br/>
overalls and denim shirts buttoned up to the collars. I thought they must be cold-<br/>
natured, as their sleeves were unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. Some wore hats&#160;<br/>
pulled firmly down over their ears. They were sullen-looking, sleepy-eyed men&#160;<br/>
who seemed unused to late hours. I sought once more for a familiar face, and at&#160;<br/>
the center of the semi-circle I found one.<br/>
“Hey, Mr. Cunningham.”<br/>
The man did not hear me, it seemed.<br/>
“Hey, Mr. Cunningham. How’s your entailment gettin‘ along?”<br/>
Mr. Walter Cunningham’s legal affairs were well known to me; Atticus had once&#160;<br/>
described them at length. The big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his&#160;<br/>
overall straps. He seemed uncomfortable; he cleared his throat and looked away.&#160;<br/>
My friendly overture had fallen flat.<br/>
Mr. Cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was white in&#160;<br/>
contrast to his sunscorched face, which led me to believe that he wore one most&#160;<br/>
days. He shifted his feet, clad in heavy work shoes.<br/>
“Don’t you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? I’m Jean Louise Finch. You brought&#160;<br/>
us some hickory nuts one time, remember?” I began to sense the futility one feels&#160;<br/>
when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance.<br/>
“I go to school with Walter,” I began again. “He’s your boy, ain’t he? Ain’t he,&#160;<br/>
sir?”<br/>
Mr. Cunningham was moved to a faint nod. He did know me, after all.<br/>
“He’s in my grade,” I said, “and he does right well. He’s a good boy,” I added, “a&#160;<br/>
real nice boy. We brought him home for dinner one time. Maybe he told you&#160;<br/>
about me, I beat him up one time but he was real nice about it. Tell him hey for&#160;<br/>
me, won’t you?”<br/>
Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were&#160;<br/>
interested in, not about what you were interested in. Mr. Cunningham displayed&#160;<br/>
no interest in his son, so I tackled his entailment once more in a last-ditch effort to&#160;<br/>
make him feel at home.<br/>
“Entailments are bad,” I was advising him, when I slowly awoke to the fact that I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=156></a>was addressing the entire aggregation. The men were all looking at me, some had&#160;<br/>
their mouths half-open. Atticus had stopped poking at Jem: they were standing&#160;<br/>
together beside Dill. Their attention amounted to fascination. Atticus’s mouth,&#160;<br/>
even, was half-open, an attitude he had once described as uncouth. Our eyes met&#160;<br/>
and he shut it.<br/>
“Well, Atticus, I was just sayin‘ to Mr. Cunningham that entailments are bad an’&#160;<br/>
all that, but you said not to worry, it takes a long time sometimes… that you all’d&#160;<br/>
ride it out together…” I was slowly drying up, wondering what idiocy I had&#160;<br/>
committed. Entailments seemed all right enough for livingroom talk.<br/>
I began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair; I could stand anything but&#160;<br/>
a bunch of people looking at me. They were quite still.<br/>
“What’s the matter?” I asked.<br/>
Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham, whose face was&#160;<br/>
equally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He squatted down and took me&#160;<br/>
by both shoulders.<br/>
“I’ll tell him you said hey, little lady,” he said.<br/>
Then he straightened up and waved a big paw. “Let’s clear out,” he called. “Let’s&#160;<br/>
get going, boys.”<br/>
As they had come, in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their ramshackle&#160;<br/>
cars. Doors slammed, engines coughed, and they were gone.<br/>
I turned to Atticus, but Atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with&#160;<br/>
his face to the wall. I went to him and pulled his sleeve. “Can we go home now?”&#160;<br/>
He nodded, produced his handkerchief, gave his face a going-over and blew his&#160;<br/>
nose violently.<br/>
“Mr. Finch?”<br/>
A soft husky voice came from the darkness above: “They gone?”<br/>
Atticus stepped back and looked up. “They’ve gone,” he said. “Get some sleep,&#160;<br/>
Tom. They won’t bother you any more.”<br/>
From a different direction, another voice cut crisply through the night: “You’re&#160;<br/>
damn tootin‘ they won’t. Had you covered all the time, Atticus.”<br/>
Mr. Underwood and a double-barreled shotgun were leaning out his window&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=157></a>above&#160;<i>The Maycomb Tribune</i>&#160;office.<br/>
It was long past my bedtime and I was growing quite tired; it seemed that Atticus&#160;<br/>
and Mr. Underwood would talk for the rest of the night, Mr. Underwood out the&#160;<br/>
window and Atticus up at him. Finally Atticus returned, switched off the light&#160;<br/>
above the jail door, and picked up his chair.<br/>
“Can I carry it for you, Mr. Finch?” asked Dill. He had not said a word the whole&#160;<br/>
time.<br/>
“Why, thank you, son.”<br/>
Walking toward the office, Dill and I fell into step behind Atticus and Jem. Dill&#160;<br/>
was encumbered by the chair, and his pace was slower. Atticus and Jem were well&#160;<br/>
ahead of us, and I assumed that Atticus was giving him hell for not going home,&#160;<br/>
but I was wrong. As they passed under a streetlight, Atticus reached out and&#160;<br/>
massaged Jem’s hair, his one gesture of affection.<br/>
<a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#1">Contents&#160;-&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#146">Prev&#160;/&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#168">Next</a><br/>
<b>Chapter 16</b><br/>
Jem heard me. He thrust his head around the connecting door. As he came to my&#160;<br/>
bed Atticus’s light flashed on. We stayed where we were until it went off; we&#160;<br/>
heard him turn over, and we waited until he was still again.<br/>
Jem took me to his room and put me in bed beside him. “Try to go to sleep,” he&#160;<br/>
said, “It’ll be all over after tomorrow, maybe.”<br/>
We had come in quietly, so as not to wake Aunty. Atticus killed the engine in the&#160;<br/>
driveway and coasted to the carhouse; we went in the back door and to our rooms&#160;<br/>
without a word. I was very tired, and was drifting into sleep when the memory of&#160;<br/>
Atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became Atticus&#160;<br/>
standing in the middle of an empty waiting street, pushing up his glasses. The full&#160;<br/>
meaning of the night’s events hit me and I began crying. Jem was awfully nice&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=158></a>about it: for once he didn’t remind me that people nearly nine years old didn’t do&#160;<br/>
things like that.<br/>
Everybody’s appetite was delicate this morning, except Jem’s: he ate his way&#160;<br/>
through three eggs. Atticus watched in frank admiration; Aunt Alexandra sipped&#160;<br/>
coffee and radiated waves of disapproval. Children who slipped out at night were&#160;<br/>
a disgrace to the family. Atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come&#160;<br/>
along, but Aunty said, “Nonsense, Mr. Underwood was there all the time.”<br/>
“You know, it’s a funny thing about Braxton,” said Atticus. “He despises&#160;<br/>
Negroes, won’t have one near him.”<br/>
Local opinion held Mr. Underwood to be an intense, profane little man, whose&#160;<br/>
father in a fey fit of humor christened Braxton Bragg, a name Mr. Underwood had&#160;<br/>
done his best to live down. Atticus said naming people after Confederate generals&#160;<br/>
made slow steady drinkers.<br/>
Calpurnia was serving Aunt Alexandra more coffee, and she shook her head at&#160;<br/>
what I thought was a pleading winning look. “You’re still too little,” she said.&#160;<br/>
“I’ll tell you when you ain’t.” I said it might help my stomach. “All right,” she&#160;<br/>
said, and got a cup from the sideboard. She poured one tablespoonful of coffee&#160;<br/>
into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk. I thanked her by sticking out my&#160;<br/>
tongue at it, and looked up to catch Aunty’s warning frown. But she was frowning&#160;<br/>
at Atticus.<br/>
She waited until Calpurnia was in the kitchen, then she said, “Don’t talk like that&#160;<br/>
in front of them.”<br/>
“Talk like what in front of whom?” he asked.<br/>
“Like that in front of Calpurnia. You said Braxton Underwood despises Negroes&#160;<br/>
right in front of her.”<br/>
“Well, I’m sure Cal knows it. Everybody in Maycomb knows it.”<br/>
I was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days, that came out&#160;<br/>
when he talked with Aunt Alexandra. It was a quiet digging in, never outright&#160;<br/>
irritation. There was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said, “Anything fit to&#160;<br/>
say at the table’s fit to say in front of Calpurnia. She knows what she means to&#160;<br/>
this family.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=159></a>“I don’t think it’s a good habit, Atticus. It encourages them. You know how they&#160;<br/>
talk among themselves. Every thing that happens in this town’s out to the&#160;<br/>
Quarters before sundown.”<br/>
My father put down his knife. “I don’t know of any law that says they can’t talk.&#160;<br/>
Maybe if we didn’t give them so much to talk about they’d be quiet. Why don’t&#160;<br/>
you drink your coffee, Scout?”<br/>
I was playing in it with the spoon. “I thought Mr. Cunningham was a friend of&#160;<br/>
ours. You told me a long time ago he was.”<br/>
“He still is.”<br/>
“But last night he wanted to hurt you.”<br/>
Atticus placed his fork beside his knife and pushed his plate aside. “Mr.&#160;<br/>
Cunningham’s basically a good man,” he said, “he just has his blind spots along&#160;<br/>
with the rest of us.”<br/>
Jem spoke. “Don’t call that a blind spot. He’da killed you last night when he first&#160;<br/>
went there.<br/>
“&#160;<br/>
“He might have hurt me a little,” Atticus conceded, “but son, you’ll understand&#160;<br/>
folks a little better when you’re older. A mob’s always made up of people, no&#160;<br/>
matter what. Mr. Cunningham was part of a mob last night, but he was still a man.&#160;<br/>
Every mob in every little Southern town is always made up of people you know—<br/>
doesn’t say much for them, does it?”<br/>
“I’ll say not,” said Jem.<br/>
“So it took an eight-year-old child to bring ‘em to their senses, didn’t it?” said&#160;<br/>
Atticus. “That proves something—that a gang of wild animals can be stopped,&#160;<br/>
simply because they’re still human. Hmp, maybe we need a police force of&#160;<br/>
children… you children last night made Walter Cunningham stand in my shoes&#160;<br/>
for a minute. That was enough.”<br/>
Well, I hoped Jem would understand folks a little better when he was older; I&#160;<br/>
wouldn’t. “First day Walter comes back to school’ll be his last,” I affirmed.<br/>
“You will not touch him,” Atticus said flatly. “I don’t want either of you bearing a&#160;<br/>
grudge about this thing, no matter what happens.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=160></a>“You see, don’t you,” said Aunt Alexandra, “what comes of things like this.&#160;<br/>
Don’t say I haven’t told you.”<br/>
Atticus said he’d never say that, pushed out his chair and got up. “There’s a day&#160;<br/>
ahead, so excuse me. Jem, I don’t want you and Scout downtown today, please.”<br/>
As Atticus departed, Dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom. “It’s&#160;<br/>
all over town this morning,” he announced, “all about how we held off a hundred&#160;<br/>
folks with our bare hands…” Aunt Alexandra stared him to silence. “It was not a&#160;<br/>
hundred folks,” she said, “and nobody held anybody off. It was just a nest of&#160;<br/>
those Cunninghams, drunk and disorderly.”<br/>
“Aw, Aunty, that’s just Dill’s way,” said Jem. He signaled us to follow him.<br/>
“You all stay in the yard today,” she said, as we made our way to the front porch.<br/>
It was like Saturday. People from the south end of the county passed our house in&#160;<br/>
a leisurely but steady stream.<br/>
Mr. Dolphus Raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred. “Don’t see how he stays&#160;<br/>
in the saddle,” murmured Jem. “How c’n you stand to get drunk ‘fore eight in the&#160;<br/>
morning?”<br/>
A wagonload of ladies rattled past us. They wore cotton sunbonnets and dresses&#160;<br/>
with long sleeves. A bearded man in a wool hat drove them. “Yonder’s some&#160;<br/>
Mennonites,” Jem said to Dill. “They don’t have buttons.” They lived deep in the&#160;<br/>
woods, did most of their trading across the river, and rarely came to Maycomb.&#160;<br/>
Dill was interested. “They’ve all got blue eyes,” Jem explained, “and the men&#160;<br/>
can’t shave after they marry. Their wives like for ‘em to tickle ’em with their&#160;<br/>
beards.”<br/>
Mr. X Billups rode by on a mule and waved to us. “He’s a funny man,” said Jem.&#160;<br/>
“X’s his name, not his initial. He was in court one time and they asked him his&#160;<br/>
name. He said X Billups. Clerk asked him to spell it and he said X. Asked him&#160;<br/>
again and he said X. They kept at it till he wrote X on a sheet of paper and held it&#160;<br/>
up for everybody to see. They asked him where he got his name and he said that’s&#160;<br/>
the way his folks signed him up when he was born.”<br/>
As the county went by us, Jem gave Dill the histories and general attitudes of the&#160;<br/>
more prominent figures: Mr. Tensaw Jones voted the straight Prohibition ticket;&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=161></a>Miss Emily Davis dipped snuff in private; Mr. Byron Waller could play the&#160;<br/>
violin; Mr. Jake Slade was cutting his third set of teeth.<br/>
A wagonload of unusually stern-faced citizens appeared. When they pointed to&#160;<br/>
Miss Maudie Atkinson’s yard, ablaze with summer flowers, Miss Maudie herself&#160;<br/>
came out on the porch. There was an odd thing about Miss Maudie—on her porch&#160;<br/>
she was too far away for us to see her features clearly, but we could always catch&#160;<br/>
her mood by the way she stood. She was now standing arms akimbo, her&#160;<br/>
shoulders drooping a little, her head cocked to one side, her glasses winking in the&#160;<br/>
sunlight. We knew she wore a grin of the uttermost wickedness.<br/>
The driver of the wagon slowed down his mules, and a shrill-voiced woman&#160;<br/>
called out: “He that cometh in vanity departeth in darkness!”<br/>
Miss Maudie answered: “A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance!”<br/>
I guess that the foot-washers thought that the Devil was quoting Scripture for his&#160;<br/>
own purposes, as the driver speeded his mules. Why they objected to Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie’s yard was a mystery, heightened in my mind because for someone who&#160;<br/>
spent all the daylight hours outdoors, Miss Maudie’s command of Scripture was&#160;<br/>
formidable.<br/>
“You goin‘ to court this morning?” asked Jem. We had strolled over.<br/>
“I am not,” she said. “I have no business with the court this morning.”<br/>
“Aren’t you goin‘ down to watch?” asked Dill.<br/>
“I am not. ‘t’s morbid, watching a poor devil on trial for his life. Look at all those&#160;<br/>
folks, it’s like a Roman carnival.”<br/>
“They hafta try him in public, Miss Maudie,” I said. “Wouldn’t be right if they&#160;<br/>
didn’t.”<br/>
“I’m quite aware of that,” she said. “Just because it’s public, I don’t have to go,&#160;<br/>
do I?”<br/>
Miss Stephanie Crawford came by. She wore a hat and gloves. “Um, um, um,”&#160;<br/>
she said. “Look at all those folks—you’d think William Jennings Bryan was&#160;<br/>
speakin‘.”<br/>
“And where are you going, Stephanie?” inquired Miss Maudie.<br/>
“To the Jitney Jungle.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=162></a>Miss Maudie said she’d never seen Miss Stephanie go to the Jitney Jungle in a hat&#160;<br/>
in her life.<br/>
“Well,” said Miss Stephanie, “I thought I might just look in at the courthouse, to&#160;<br/>
see what Atticus’s up to.”<br/>
“Better be careful he doesn’t hand you a subpoena.”<br/>
We asked Miss Maudie to elucidate: she said Miss Stephanie seemed to know so&#160;<br/>
much about the case she might as well be called on to testify.<br/>
We held off until noon, when Atticus came home to dinner and said they’d spent&#160;<br/>
the morning picking the jury. After dinner, we stopped by for Dill and went to&#160;<br/>
town.<br/>
It was a gala occasion. There was no room at the public hitching rail for another&#160;<br/>
animal, mules and wagons were parked under every available tree. The&#160;<br/>
courthouse square was covered with picnic parties sitting on newspapers, washing&#160;<br/>
down biscuit and syrup with warm milk from fruit jars. Some people were&#160;<br/>
gnawing on cold chicken and cold fried pork chops. The more affluent chased&#160;<br/>
their food with drugstore Coca-Cola in bulb-shaped soda glasses. Greasy-faced&#160;<br/>
children popped-the-whip through the crowd, and babies lunched at their mothers’&#160;<br/>
breasts.<br/>
In a far corner of the square, the Negroes sat quietly in the sun, dining on&#160;<br/>
sardines, crackers, and the more vivid flavors of Nehi Cola. Mr. Dolphus&#160;<br/>
Raymond sat with them.<br/>
“Jem,” said Dill, “he’s drinkin‘ out of a sack.”<br/>
Mr. Dolphus Raymond seemed to be so doing: two yellow drugstore straws ran&#160;<br/>
from his mouth to the depths of a brown paper bag.<br/>
“Ain’t ever seen anybody do that,” murmured Dill.<br/>
“How does he keep what’s in it in it?”<br/>
Jem giggled. “He’s got a Co-Cola bottle full of whiskey in there. That’s so’s not&#160;<br/>
to upset the ladies. You’ll see him sip it all afternoon, he’ll step out for a while&#160;<br/>
and fill it back up.”<br/>
“Why’s he sittin‘ with the colored folks?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=163></a>“Always does. He likes ‘em better’n he likes us, I reckon. Lives by himself way&#160;<br/>
down near the county line. He’s got a colored woman and all sorts of mixed&#160;<br/>
chillun. Show you some of ’em if we see ‘em.”<br/>
“He doesn’t look like trash,” said Dill.<br/>
“He’s not, he owns all one side of the riverbank down there, and he’s from a real&#160;<br/>
old family to boot.”<br/>
“Then why does he do like that?”<br/>
“That’s just his way,” said Jem. “They say he never got over his weddin‘. He was&#160;<br/>
supposed to marry one of the—the Spencer ladies, I think. They were gonna have&#160;<br/>
a huge weddin’, but they didn’t—after the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and&#160;<br/>
blew her head off. Shotgun. She pulled the trigger with her toes.”<br/>
“Did they ever know why?”<br/>
“No,” said Jem, “nobody ever knew quite why but Mr. Dolphus. They said it was&#160;<br/>
because she found out about his colored woman, he reckoned he could keep her&#160;<br/>
and get married too. He’s been sorta drunk ever since. You know, though, he’s&#160;<br/>
real good to those chillun—”<br/>
“Jem,” I asked, “what’s a mixed child?”<br/>
“Half white, half colored. You’ve seen ‘em, Scout. You know that red-kinky-<br/>
headed one that delivers for the drugstore. He’s half white. They’re real sad.”<br/>
“Sad, how come?”<br/>
“They don’t belong anywhere. Colored folks won’t have ‘em because they’re half&#160;<br/>
white; white folks won’t have ’em cause they’re colored, so they’re just in-<br/>
betweens, don’t belong anywhere. But Mr. Dolphus, now, they say he’s shipped&#160;<br/>
two of his up north. They don’t mind ‘em up north. Yonder’s one of ’em.”<br/>
A small boy clutching a Negro woman’s hand walked toward us. He looked all&#160;<br/>
Negro to me: he was rich chocolate with flaring nostrils and beautiful teeth.&#160;<br/>
Sometimes he would skip happily, and the Negro woman tugged his hand to make&#160;<br/>
him stop.<br/>
Jem waited until they passed us. “That’s one of the little ones,” he said.<br/>
“How can you tell?” asked Dill. “He looked black to me.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=164></a>“You can’t sometimes, not unless you know who they are. But he’s half&#160;<br/>
Raymond, all right.”<br/>
“But how can you&#160;<i>tell</i>?” I asked.<br/>
“I told you, Scout, you just hafta know who they are.”<br/>
“Well how do you know we ain’t Negroes?”<br/>
“Uncle Jack Finch says we really don’t know. He says as far as he can trace back&#160;<br/>
the Finches we ain’t, but for all he knows we mighta come straight out of Ethiopia&#160;<br/>
durin‘ the Old Testament.”<br/>
“Well if we came out durin‘ the Old Testament it’s too long ago to matter.”<br/>
“That’s what I thought,” said Jem, “but around here once you have a drop of&#160;<br/>
Negro blood, that makes you all black. Hey, look—”<br/>
Some invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and scatter bits of&#160;<br/>
newspaper, cellophane, and wrapping paper. Children came to mothers, babies&#160;<br/>
were cradled on hips as men in sweat-stained hats collected their families and&#160;<br/>
herded them through the courthouse doors. In the far corner of the square the&#160;<br/>
Negroes and Mr. Dolphus Raymond stood up and dusted their breeches. There&#160;<br/>
were few women and children among them, which seemed to dispel the holiday&#160;<br/>
mood. They waited patiently at the doors behind the white families.<br/>
“Let’s go in,” said Dill.<br/>
“Naw, we better wait till they get in, Atticus might not like it if he sees us,” said&#160;<br/>
Jem.<br/>
The Maycomb County courthouse was faintly reminiscent of Arlington in one&#160;<br/>
respect: the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were too heavy for their light&#160;<br/>
burden. The pillars were all that remained standing when the original courthouse&#160;<br/>
burned in 1856. Another courthouse was built around them. It is better to say,&#160;<br/>
built in spite of them. But for the south porch, the Maycomb County courthouse&#160;<br/>
was early Victorian, presenting an unoffensive vista when seen from the north.&#160;<br/>
From the other side, however, Greek revival columns clashed with a big&#160;<br/>
nineteenth-century clock tower housing a rusty unreliable instrument, a view&#160;<br/>
indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap of the past.<br/>
To reach the courtroom, on the second floor, one passed sundry sunless county&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=165></a>cubbyholes: the tax assessor, the tax collector, the county clerk, the county&#160;<br/>
solicitor, the circuit clerk, the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutches that&#160;<br/>
smelled of decaying record books mingled with old damp cement and stale urine.&#160;<br/>
It was necessary to turn on the lights in the daytime; there was always a film of&#160;<br/>
dust on the rough floorboards. The inhabitants of these offices were creatures of&#160;<br/>
their environment: little gray-faced men, they seemed untouched by wind or sun.<br/>
We knew there was a crowd, but we had not bargained for the multitudes in the&#160;<br/>
first-floor hallway. I got separated from Jem and Dill, but made my way toward&#160;<br/>
the wall by the stairwell, knowing Jem would come for me eventually. I found&#160;<br/>
myself in the middle of the Idlers’ Club and made myself as unobtrusive as&#160;<br/>
possible. This was a group of white-shirted, khaki-trousered, suspendered old men&#160;<br/>
who had spent their lives doing nothing and passed their twilight days doing same&#160;<br/>
on pine benches under the live oaks on the square. Attentive critics of courthouse&#160;<br/>
business, Atticus said they knew as much law as the Chief Justice, from long&#160;<br/>
years of observation. Normally, they were the court’s only spectators, and today&#160;<br/>
they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortable routine. When they&#160;<br/>
spoke, their voices sounded casually important. The conversation was about my&#160;<br/>
father.<br/>
“…thinks he knows what he’s doing,” one said.<br/>
“Oh-h now, I wouldn’t say that,” said another. “Atticus Finch’s a deep reader, a&#160;<br/>
mighty deep reader.”<br/>
“He reads all right, that’s all he does.” The club snickered.<br/>
“Lemme tell you somethin‘ now, Billy,” a third said, “you know the court&#160;<br/>
appointed him to defend this nigger.”<br/>
“Yeah, but Atticus aims to defend him. That’s what I don’t like about it.”<br/>
This was news, news that put a different light on things: Atticus had to, whether&#160;<br/>
he wanted to or not. I thought it odd that he hadn’t said anything to us about it—<br/>
we could have used it many times in defending him and ourselves. He had to,&#160;<br/>
that’s why he was doing it, equaled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that&#160;<br/>
explain the town’s attitude? The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus&#160;<br/>
aimed to defend him. That’s what they didn’t like about it. It was confusing.<br/>
The Negroes, having waited for the white people to go upstairs, began to come in.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=166></a>“Whoa now, just a minute,” said a club member, holding up his walking stick.&#160;<br/>
“Just don’t start up them there stairs yet awhile.”<br/>
The club began its stiff-jointed climb and ran into Dill and Jem on their way down&#160;<br/>
looking for me. They squeezed past and Jem called, “Scout, come on, there ain’t a&#160;<br/>
seat left. We’ll hafta stand up.”<br/>
“Looka there, now.” he said irritably, as the black people surged upstairs. The old&#160;<br/>
men ahead of them would take most of the standing room. We were out of luck&#160;<br/>
and it was my fault, Jem informed me. We stood miserably by the wall.<br/>
“Can’t you all get in?”<br/>
Reverend Sykes was looking down at us, black hat in hand.<br/>
“Hey, Reverend,” said Jem. “Naw, Scout here messed us up.”<br/>
“Well, let’s see what we can do.”<br/>
Reverend Sykes edged his way upstairs. In a few moments he was back. “There’s&#160;<br/>
not a seat downstairs. Do you all reckon it’ll be all right if you all came to the&#160;<br/>
balcony with me?”<br/>
“Gosh yes,” said Jem. Happily, we sped ahead of Reverend Sykes to the&#160;<br/>
courtroom floor. There, we went up a covered staircase and waited at the door.&#160;<br/>
Reverend Sykes came puffing behind us, and steered us gently through the black&#160;<br/>
people in the balcony. Four Negroes rose and gave us their front-row seats.<br/>
The Colored balcony ran along three walls of the courtroom like a second-story&#160;<br/>
veranda, and from it we could see everything.<br/>
The jury sat to the left, under long windows. Sunburned, lanky, they seemed to be&#160;<br/>
all farmers, but this was natural: townfolk rarely sat on juries, they were either&#160;<br/>
struck or excused. One or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressed-up&#160;<br/>
Cunninghams. At this stage they sat straight and alert.<br/>
The circuit solicitor and another man, Atticus and Tom Robinson sat at tables&#160;<br/>
with their backs to us. There was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the&#160;<br/>
solicitor’s table; Atticus’s was bare. Just inside the railing that divided the&#160;<br/>
spectators from the court, the witnesses sat on cowhide-bottomed chairs. Their&#160;<br/>
backs were to us.<br/>
Judge Taylor was on the bench, looking like a sleepy old shark, his pilot fish&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=167></a>writing rapidly below in front of him. Judge Taylor looked like most judges I had&#160;<br/>
ever seen: amiable, white-haired, slightly ruddy-faced, he was a man who ran his&#160;<br/>
court with an alarming informality—he sometimes propped his feet up, he often&#160;<br/>
cleaned his fingernails with his pocket knife. In long equity hearings, especially&#160;<br/>
after dinner, he gave the impression of dozing, an impression dispelled forever&#160;<br/>
when a lawyer once deliberately pushed a pile of books to the floor in a desperate&#160;<br/>
effort to wake him up. Without opening his eyes, Judge Taylor murmured, “Mr.&#160;<br/>
Whitley, do that again and it’ll cost you one hundred dollars.”<br/>
He was a man learned in the law, and although he seemed to take his job casually,&#160;<br/>
in reality he kept a firm grip on any proceedings that came before him. Only once&#160;<br/>
was Judge Taylor ever seen at a dead standstill in open court, and the&#160;<br/>
Cunninghams stopped him. Old Sarum, their stamping grounds, was populated by&#160;<br/>
two families separate and apart in the beginning, but unfortunately bearing the&#160;<br/>
same name. The Cunninghams married the Coninghams until the spelling of the&#160;<br/>
names was academic—academic until a Cunningham disputed a Coningham over&#160;<br/>
land titles and took to the law. During a controversy of this character, Jeems&#160;<br/>
Cunningham testified that his mother spelled it Cunningham on deeds and things,&#160;<br/>
but she was really a Coningham, she was an uncertain speller, a seldom reader,&#160;<br/>
and was given to looking far away sometimes when she sat on the front gallery in&#160;<br/>
the evening. After nine hours of listening to the eccentricities of Old Sarum’s&#160;<br/>
inhabitants, Judge Taylor threw the case out of court. When asked upon what&#160;<br/>
grounds, Judge Taylor said, “Champertous connivance,” and declared he hoped to&#160;<br/>
God the litigants were satisfied by each having had their public say. They were.&#160;<br/>
That was all they had wanted in the first place.<br/>
Judge Taylor had one interesting habit. He permitted smoking in his courtroom&#160;<br/>
but did not himself indulge: sometimes, if one was lucky, one had the privilege of&#160;<br/>
watching him put a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up. Bit by&#160;<br/>
bit the dead cigar would disappear, to reappear some hours later as a flat slick&#160;<br/>
mess, its essence extracted and mingling with Judge Taylor’s digestive juices. I&#160;<br/>
once asked Atticus how Mrs. Taylor stood to kiss him, but Atticus said they&#160;<br/>
didn’t kiss much.<br/>
The witness stand was to the right of Judge Taylor, and when we got to our seats&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=168></a>Mr. Heck Tate was already on it.<br/>

<b>Chapter 17</b><br/>
“Jem,” I said, “are those the Ewells sittin‘ down yonder?”<br/>
“Hush,” said Jem, “Mr. Heck Tate’s testifyin‘.”<br/>
Mr. Tate had dressed for the occasion. He wore an ordinary business suit, which&#160;<br/>
made him look somehow like every other man: gone were his high boots, lumber&#160;<br/>
jacket, and bullet-studded belt. From that moment he ceased to terrify me. He was&#160;<br/>
sitting forward in the witness chair, his hands clasped between his knees, listening&#160;<br/>
attentively to the circuit solicitor.<br/>
The solicitor, a Mr. Gilmer, was not well known to us. He was from Abbottsville;&#160;<br/>
we saw him only when court convened, and that rarely, for court was of no&#160;<br/>
special interest to Jem and me. A balding, smooth-faced man, he could have been&#160;<br/>
anywhere between forty and sixty. Although his back was to us, we knew he had&#160;<br/>
a slight cast in one of his eyes which he used to his advantage: he seemed to be&#160;<br/>
looking at a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was&#160;<br/>
hell on juries and witnesses. The jury, thinking themselves under close scrutiny,&#160;<br/>
paid attention; so did the witnesses, thinking likewise.<br/>
“…in your own words, Mr. Tate,” Mr. Gilmer was saying.<br/>
“Well,” said Mr. Tate, touching his glasses and speaking to his knees, “I was&#160;<br/>
called—”<br/>
“Could you say it to the jury, Mr. Tate? Thank you. Who called you?”<br/>
Mr. Tate said, “I was fetched by Bob—by Mr. Bob Ewell yonder, one night—”<br/>
“What night, sir?”<br/>
Mr. Tate said, “It was the night of November twenty-first. I was just leaving my&#160;<br/>
office to go home when B—Mr. Ewell came in, very excited he was, and said get&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=169></a>out to his house quick, some nigger’d raped his girl.”<br/>
“Did you go?”<br/>
“Certainly. Got in the car and went out as fast as I could.”<br/>
“And what did you find?”<br/>
“Found her lying on the floor in the middle of the front room, one on the right as&#160;<br/>
you go in. She was pretty well beat up, but I heaved her to her feet and she&#160;<br/>
washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she was all right. I asked her&#160;<br/>
who hurt her and she said it was Tom Robinson—”<br/>
Judge Taylor, who had been concentrating on his fingernails, looked up as if he&#160;<br/>
were expecting an objection, but Atticus was quiet.<br/>
“—asked her if he beat her like that, she said yes he had. Asked her if he took&#160;<br/>
advantage of her and she said yes he did. So I went down to Robinson’s house&#160;<br/>
and brought him back. She identified him as the one, so I took him in. That’s all&#160;<br/>
there was to it.”<br/>
“Thank you,” said Mr. Gilmer.<br/>
Judge Taylor said, “Any questions, Atticus?”<br/>
“Yes,” said my father. He was sitting behind his table; his chair was skewed to&#160;<br/>
one side, his legs were crossed and one arm was resting on the back of his chair.<br/>
“Did you call a doctor, Sheriff? Did anybody call a doctor?” asked Atticus.<br/>
“No sir,” said Mr. Tate.<br/>
“Didn’t call a doctor?”<br/>
“No sir,” repeated Mr. Tate.<br/>
“Why not?” There was an edge to Atticus’s voice.<br/>
“Well I can tell you why I didn’t. It wasn’t necessary, Mr. Finch. She was mighty&#160;<br/>
banged up. Something sho‘ happened, it was obvious.”<br/>
“But you didn’t call a doctor? While you were there did anyone send for one,&#160;<br/>
fetch one, carry her to one?”<br/>
“No sir—”<br/>
Judge Taylor broke in. “He’s answered the question three times, Atticus. He&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=170></a>didn’t call a doctor.”<br/>
Atticus said, “I just wanted to make sure, Judge,” and the judge smiled.<br/>
Jem’s hand, which was resting on the balcony rail, tightened around it. He drew in&#160;<br/>
his breath suddenly. Glancing below, I saw no corresponding reaction, and&#160;<br/>
wondered if Jem was trying to be dramatic. Dill was watching peacefully, and so&#160;<br/>
was Reverend Sykes beside him.<br/>
“What is it?” I whispered, and got a terse, “Sh-h!”<br/>
“Sheriff,” Atticus was saying, “you say she was mighty banged up. In what way?”<br/>
“Well—”<br/>
“Just describe her injuries, Heck.”<br/>
“Well, she was beaten around the head. There was already bruises comin‘ on her&#160;<br/>
arms, and it happened about thirty minutes before—”<br/>
“How do you know?”<br/>
Mr. Tate grinned. “Sorry, that’s what they said. Anyway, she was pretty bruised&#160;<br/>
up when I got there, and she had a black eye comin‘.”<br/>
“Which eye?”<br/>
Mr. Tate blinked and ran his hands through his hair. “Let’s see,” he said softly,&#160;<br/>
then he looked at Atticus as if he considered the question childish. “Can’t you&#160;<br/>
remember?” Atticus asked.<br/>
Mr. Tate pointed to an invisible person five inches in front of him and said, “Her&#160;<br/>
left.”<br/>
“Wait a minute, Sheriff,” said Atticus. “Was it her left facing you or her left&#160;<br/>
looking the same way you were?”<br/>
Mr. Tate said, “Oh yes, that’d make it her right. It was her right eye, Mr. Finch. I&#160;<br/>
remember now, she was bunged up on that side of her face…”<br/>
Mr. Tate blinked again, as if something had suddenly been made plain to him.&#160;<br/>
Then he turned his head and looked around at Tom Robinson. As if by instinct,&#160;<br/>
Tom Robinson raised his head.<br/>
Something had been made plain to Atticus also, and it brought him to his feet.&#160;<br/>
“Sheriff, please repeat what you said.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=171></a>“It was her right eye, I said.”<br/>
“No…” Atticus walked to the court reporter’s desk and bent down to the furiously&#160;<br/>
scribbling hand. It stopped, flipped back the shorthand pad, and the court reporter&#160;<br/>
said, “‘Mr. Finch. I remember now she was bunged up on that side of the face.’”<br/>
Atticus looked up at Mr. Tate. “Which side again, Heck?”<br/>
“The right side, Mr. Finch, but she had more bruises—you wanta hear about ‘em?”<br/>
Atticus seemed to be bordering on another question, but he thought better of it&#160;<br/>
and said, “Yes, what were her other injuries?” As Mr. Tate answered, Atticus&#160;<br/>
turned and looked at Tom Robinson as if to say this was something they hadn’t&#160;<br/>
bargained for.<br/>
“…her arms were bruised, and she showed me her neck. There were definite&#160;<br/>
finger marks on her gullet—”<br/>
“All around her throat? At the back of her neck?”<br/>
“I’d say they were all around, Mr. Finch.”<br/>
“You would?”<br/>
“Yes sir, she had a small throat, anybody could’a reached around it with—”<br/>
“Just answer the question yes or no, please, Sheriff,” said Atticus dryly, and Mr.&#160;<br/>
Tate fell silent.<br/>
Atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor, who shook his head at the&#160;<br/>
judge, who nodded to Mr. Tate, who rose stiffly and stepped down from the&#160;<br/>
witness stand.<br/>
Below us, heads turned, feet scraped the floor, babies were shifted to shoulders,&#160;<br/>
and a few children scampered out of the courtroom. The Negroes behind us&#160;<br/>
whispered softly among themselves; Dill was asking Reverend Sykes what it was&#160;<br/>
all about, but Reverend Sykes said he didn’t know. So far, things were utterly&#160;<br/>
dull: nobody had thundered, there were no arguments between opposing counsel,&#160;<br/>
there was no drama; a grave disappointment to all present, it seemed. Atticus was&#160;<br/>
proceeding amiably, as if he were involved in a title dispute. With his infinite&#160;<br/>
capacity for calming turbulent seas, he could make a rape case as dry as a sermon.&#160;<br/>
Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells, of sleepy-<br/>
eyed sullen men, of a husky voice calling in the night, “Mr. Finch? They gone?”&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=172></a>Our nightmare had gone with daylight, everything would come out all right.<br/>
All the spectators were as relaxed as Judge Taylor, except Jem. His mouth was&#160;<br/>
twisted into a purposeful half-grin, and his eyes happy about, and he said&#160;<br/>
something about corroborating evidence, which made me sure he was showing off.<br/>
“…Robert E. Lee Ewell!”<br/>
In answer to the clerk’s booming voice, a little bantam cock of a man rose and&#160;<br/>
strutted to the stand, the back of his neck reddening at the sound of his name.&#160;<br/>
When he turned around to take the oath, we saw that his face was as red as his&#160;<br/>
neck. We also saw no resemblance to his namesake. A shock of wispy new-<br/>
washed hair stood up from his forehead; his nose was thin, pointed, and shiny; he&#160;<br/>
had no chin to speak of—it seemed to be part of his crepey neck.<br/>
“—so help me God,” he crowed.<br/>
Every town the size of Maycomb had families like the Ewells. No economic&#160;<br/>
fluctuations changed their status—people like the Ewells lived as guests of the&#160;<br/>
county in prosperity as well as in the depths of a depression. No truant officers&#160;<br/>
could keep their numerous offspring in school; no public health officer could free&#160;<br/>
them from congenital defects, various worms, and the diseases indigenous to&#160;<br/>
filthy surroundings.<br/>
Maycomb’s Ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a&#160;<br/>
Negro cabin. The cabin’s plank walls were supplemented with sheets of&#160;<br/>
corrugated iron, its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat, so only its general&#160;<br/>
shape suggested its original design: square, with four tiny rooms opening onto a&#160;<br/>
shotgun hall, the cabin rested uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone. Its&#160;<br/>
windows were merely open spaces in the walls, which in the summertime were&#160;<br/>
covered with greasy strips of cheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on&#160;<br/>
Maycomb’s refuse.<br/>
The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a thorough&#160;<br/>
gleaning every day, and the fruits of their industry (those that were not eaten)&#160;<br/>
made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane&#160;<br/>
child: what passed for a fence was bits of tree-limbs, broomsticks and tool shafts,&#160;<br/>
all tipped with rusty hammer-heads, snaggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes&#160;<br/>
and grubbing hoes, held on with pieces of barbed wire. Enclosed by this barricade&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=173></a>was a dirty yard containing the remains of a Model-T Ford (on blocks), a&#160;<br/>
discarded dentist’s chair, an ancient icebox, plus lesser items: old shoes, worn-out&#160;<br/>
table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, under which scrawny orange chickens&#160;<br/>
pecked hopefully.<br/>
One corner of the yard, though, bewildered Maycomb. Against the fence, in a&#160;<br/>
line, were six chipped-enamel slop jars holding brilliant red geraniums, cared for&#160;<br/>
as tenderly as if they belonged to Miss Maudie Atkinson, had Miss Maudie&#160;<br/>
deigned to permit a geranium on her premises. People said they were Mayella&#160;<br/>
Ewell’s.<br/>
Nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place. Some people said&#160;<br/>
six, others said nine; there were always several dirty-faced ones at the windows&#160;<br/>
when anyone passed by. Nobody had occasion to pass by except at Christmas,&#160;<br/>
when the churches delivered baskets, and when the mayor of Maycomb asked us&#160;<br/>
to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash.<br/>
Atticus took us with him last Christmas when he complied with the mayor’s&#160;<br/>
request. A dirt road ran from the highway past the dump, down to a small Negro&#160;<br/>
settlement some five hundred yards beyond the Ewells‘. It was necessary either to&#160;<br/>
back out to the highway or go the full length of the road and turn around; most&#160;<br/>
people turned around in the Negroes’ front yards. In the frosty December dusk,&#160;<br/>
their cabins looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys&#160;<br/>
and doorways glowing amber from the fires inside. There were delicious smells&#160;<br/>
about: chicken, bacon frying crisp as the twilight air. Jem and I detected squirrel&#160;<br/>
cooking, but it took an old countryman like Atticus to identify possum and rabbit,&#160;<br/>
aromas that vanished when we rode back past the Ewell residence.<br/>
All the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his&#160;<br/>
nearest neighbors was, that if scrubbed with lye soap in very hot water, his skin&#160;<br/>
was white.<br/>
“Mr. Robert Ewell?” asked Mr. Gilmer.<br/>
“That’s m’name, cap’n,” said the witness.<br/>
Mr. Gilmer’s back stiffened a little, and I felt sorry for him. Perhaps I’d better&#160;<br/>
explain something now. I’ve heard that lawyers’ children, on seeing their parents&#160;<br/>
in court in the heat of argument, get the wrong idea: they think opposing counsel&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=174></a>to be the personal enemies of their parents, they suffer agonies, and are surprised&#160;<br/>
to see them often go out arm-in-arm with their tormenters during the first recess.&#160;<br/>
This was not true of Jem and me. We acquired no traumas from watching our&#160;<br/>
father win or lose. I’m sorry that I can’t provide any drama in this respect; if I did,&#160;<br/>
it would not be true. We could tell, however, when debate became more&#160;<br/>
acrimonious than professional, but this was from watching lawyers other than our&#160;<br/>
father. I never heard Atticus raise his voice in my life, except to a deaf witness.&#160;<br/>
Mr. Gilmer was doing his job, as Atticus was doing his. Besides, Mr. Ewell was&#160;<br/>
Mr. Gilmer’s witness, and he had no business being rude to him of all people.<br/>
“Are you the father of Mayella Ewell?” was the next question.<br/>
“Well, if I ain’t I can’t do nothing about it now, her ma’s dead,” was the answer.<br/>
Judge Taylor stirred. He turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at&#160;<br/>
the witness. “Are you the father of Mayella Ewell?” he asked, in a way that made&#160;<br/>
the laughter below us stop suddenly.<br/>
“Yes sir,” Mr. Ewell said meekly.<br/>
Judge Taylor went on in tones of good will: “This the first time you’ve ever been&#160;<br/>
in court? I don’t recall ever seeing you here.” At the witness’s affirmative nod he&#160;<br/>
continued, “Well, let’s get something straight. There will be no more audibly&#160;<br/>
obscene speculations on any subject from anybody in this courtroom as long as&#160;<br/>
I’m sitting here. Do you understand?”<br/>
Mr. Ewell nodded, but I don’t think he did. Judge Taylor sighed and said, “All&#160;<br/>
right, Mr. Gilmer?”<br/>
“Thank you, sir. Mr. Ewell, would you tell us in your own words what happened&#160;<br/>
on the evening of November twenty-first, please?”<br/>
Jem grinned and pushed his hair back. Just-in-your-own words was Mr. Gilmer’s&#160;<br/>
trademark. We often wondered who else’s words Mr. Gilmer was afraid his&#160;<br/>
witness might employ.<br/>
“Well, the night of November twenty-one I was comin‘ in from the woods with a&#160;<br/>
load o’kindlin’ and just as I got to the fence I heard Mayella screamin‘ like a&#160;<br/>
stuck hog inside the house—”<br/>
Here Judge Taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have decided his&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=175></a>speculations devoid of evil intent, for he subsided sleepily.<br/>
“What time was it, Mr. Ewell?”<br/>
“Just ‘fore sundown. Well, I was sayin’ Mayella was screamin‘ fit to beat Jesus<br/>
—” another glance from the bench silenced Mr. Ewell.<br/>
“Yes? She was screaming?” said Mr. Gilmer.<br/>
Mr. Ewell looked confusedly at the judge. “Well, Mayella was raisin‘ this holy&#160;<br/>
racket so I dropped m’load and run as fast as I could but I run into th’ fence, but&#160;<br/>
when I got distangled I run up to th‘ window and I seen—” Mr. Ewell’s face grew&#160;<br/>
scarlet. He stood up and pointed his finger at Tom Robinson. “—I seen that black&#160;<br/>
nigger yonder ruttin’ on my Mayella!”<br/>
So serene was Judge Taylor’s court, that he had few occasions to use his gavel,&#160;<br/>
but he hammered fully five minutes. Atticus was on his feet at the bench saying&#160;<br/>
something to him, Mr. Heck Tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle&#160;<br/>
aisle quelling the packed courtroom. Behind us, there was an angry muffled groan&#160;<br/>
from the colored people.<br/>
Reverend Sykes leaned across Dill and me, pulling at Jem’s elbow. “Mr. Jem,” he&#160;<br/>
said, “you better take Miss Jean Louise home. Mr. Jem, you hear me?”<br/>
Jem turned his head. “Scout, go home. Dill, you’n‘Scout go home.”<br/>
“You gotta make me first,” I said, remembering Atticus’s blessed dictum.<br/>
Jem scowled furiously at me, then said to Reverend Sykes, “I think it’s okay,&#160;<br/>
Reverend, she doesn’t understand it.”<br/>
I was mortally offended. “I most certainly do, I c’n understand anything you can.”<br/>
“Aw hush. She doesn’t understand it, Reverend, she ain’t nine yet.”<br/>
Reverend Sykes’s black eyes were anxious. “Mr. Finch know you all are here?&#160;<br/>
This ain’t fit for Miss Jean Louise or you boys either.”<br/>
Jem shook his head. “He can’t see us this far away. It’s all right, Reverend.”<br/>
I knew Jem would win, because I knew nothing could make him leave now. Dill&#160;<br/>
and I were safe, for a while: Atticus could see us from where he was, if he looked.<br/>
As Judge Taylor banged his gavel, Mr. Ewell was sitting smugly in the witness&#160;<br/>
chair, surveying his handiwork. With one phrase he had turned happy picknickers&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=176></a>into a sulky, tense, murmuring crowd, being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps&#160;<br/>
lessening in intensity until the only sound in the courtroom was a dim pink-pink-<br/>
pink: the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil.<br/>
In possession of his court once more, Judge Taylor leaned back in his chair. He&#160;<br/>
looked suddenly weary; his age was showing, and I thought about what Atticus&#160;<br/>
had said—he and Mrs. Taylor didn’t kiss much—he must have been nearly&#160;<br/>
seventy.<br/>
“There has been a request,” Judge Taylor said, “that this courtroom be cleared of&#160;<br/>
spectators, or at least of women and children, a request that will be denied for the&#160;<br/>
time being. People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for,&#160;<br/>
and they have the right to subject their children to it, but I can assure you of one&#160;<br/>
thing: you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this&#160;<br/>
courtroom, but you won’t leave it until the whole boiling of you come before me&#160;<br/>
on contempt charges. Mr. Ewell, you will keep your testimony within the confines&#160;<br/>
of Christian English usage, if that is possible. Proceed, Mr. Gilmer.”<br/>
Mr. Ewell reminded me of a deaf-mute. I was sure he had never heard the words&#160;<br/>
Judge Taylor directed at him—his mouth struggled silently with them—but their&#160;<br/>
import registered on his face. Smugness faded from it, replaced by a dogged&#160;<br/>
earnestness that fooled Judge Taylor not at all: as long as Mr. Ewell was on the&#160;<br/>
stand, the judge kept his eyes on him, as if daring him to make a false move.<br/>
Mr. Gilmer and Atticus exchanged glances. Atticus was sitting down again, his&#160;<br/>
fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face. Mr. Gilmer looked rather&#160;<br/>
desperate. A question from Judge Taylor made him relax: “Mr. Ewell, did you see&#160;<br/>
the defendant having sexual intercourse with your daughter?”<br/>
“Yes, I did.”<br/>
The spectators were quiet, but the defendant said something. Atticus whispered to&#160;<br/>
him, and Tom Robinson was silent.<br/>
“You say you were at the window?” asked Mr. Gilmer.<br/>
“Yes sir.”<br/>
“How far is it from the ground?”<br/>
“‘bout three foot.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=177></a>“Did you have a clear view of the room?”<br/>
“Yes sir.”<br/>
“How did the room look?”<br/>
“Well, it was all slung about, like there was a fight.”<br/>
“What did you do when you saw the defendant?”&#160;<br/>
“Well, I run around the house to get in, but he run out the front door just ahead of&#160;<br/>
me. I sawed who he was, all right. I was too distracted about Mayella to run&#160;<br/>
after’im. I run in the house and she was lyin‘ on the floor squallin’—”<br/>
“Then what did you do?”<br/>
“Why, I run for Tate quick as I could. I knowed who it was, all right, lived down&#160;<br/>
yonder in that nigger-nest, passed the house every day. Jedge, I’ve asked this&#160;<br/>
county for fifteen years to clean out that nest down yonder, they’re dangerous to&#160;<br/>
live around ‘sides devaluin’ my property—”<br/>
“Thank you, Mr. Ewell,” said Mr. Gilmer hurriedly.<br/>
The witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into Atticus, who&#160;<br/>
had risen to question him. Judge Taylor permitted the court to laugh.<br/>
“Just a minute, sir,” said Atticus genially. “Could I ask you a question or two?”<br/>
Mr. Ewell backed up into the witness chair, settled himself, and regarded Atticus&#160;<br/>
with haughty suspicion, an expression common to Maycomb County witnesses&#160;<br/>
when confronted by opposing counsel.<br/>
“Mr. Ewell,” Atticus began, “folks were doing a lot of running that night. Let’s&#160;<br/>
see, you say you ran to the house, you ran to the window, you ran inside, you ran&#160;<br/>
to Mayella, you ran for Mr. Tate. Did you, during all this running, run for a&#160;<br/>
doctor?”<br/>
“Wadn’t no need to. I seen what happened.”<br/>
“But there’s one thing I don’t understand,” said Atticus. “Weren’t you concerned&#160;<br/>
with Mayella’s condition?”<br/>
“I most positively was,” said Mr. Ewell. “I seen who done it.”<br/>
“No, I mean her physical condition. Did you not think the nature of her injuries&#160;<br/>
warranted immediate medical attention?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=178></a>“What?”<br/>
“Didn’t you think she should have had a doctor, immediately?”<br/>
The witness said he never thought of it, he had never called a doctor to any of&#160;<br/>
his’n in his life, and if he had it would have cost him five dollars. “That all?” he&#160;<br/>
asked.<br/>
“Not quite,” said Atticus casually. “Mr. Ewell, you heard the sheriff’s testimony,&#160;<br/>
didn’t you?”<br/>
“How’s that?”<br/>
“You were in the courtroom when Mr. Heck Tate was on the stand, weren’t you?&#160;<br/>
You heard everything he said, didn’t you?”<br/>
Mr. Ewell considered the matter carefully, and seemed to decide that the question&#160;<br/>
was safe.<br/>
“Yes,” he said.<br/>
“Do you agree with his description of Mayella’s injuries?”<br/>
“How’s that?”<br/>
Atticus looked around at Mr. Gilmer and smiled. Mr. Ewell seemed determined&#160;<br/>
not to give the defense the time of day.<br/>
“Mr. Tate testified that her right eye was blackened, that she was beaten around&#160;<br/>
the—”<br/>
“Oh yeah,” said the witness. “I hold with everything Tate said.”<br/>
“You do?” asked Atticus mildly. “I just want to make sure.” He went to the court&#160;<br/>
reporter, said something, and the reporter entertained us for some minutes by&#160;<br/>
reading Mr. Tate’s testimony as if it were stock-market quotations: “…which eye&#160;<br/>
her left oh yes that’d make it her right it was her right eye Mr. Finch I remember&#160;<br/>
now she was bunged.” He flipped the page. “Up on that side of the face Sheriff&#160;<br/>
please repeat what you said it was her right eye I said—”<br/>
“Thank you, Bert,” said Atticus. “You heard it again, Mr. Ewell. Do you have&#160;<br/>
anything to add to it? Do you agree with the sheriff?”<br/>
“I holds with Tate. Her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up.”<br/>
The little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=179></a>It was becoming evident that he thought Atticus an easy match. He seemed to&#160;<br/>
grow ruddy again; his chest swelled, and once more he was a red little rooster. I&#160;<br/>
thought he’d burst his shirt at Atticus’s next question:<br/>
“Mr. Ewell, can you read and write?”<br/>
Mr. Gilmer interrupted. “Objection,” he said. “Can’t see what witness’s literacy&#160;<br/>
has to do with the case, irrelevant’n‘immaterial.”<br/>
Judge Taylor was about to speak but Atticus said, “Judge, if you’ll allow the&#160;<br/>
question plus another one you’ll soon see.”<br/>
“All right, let’s see,” said Judge Taylor, “but make sure we see, Atticus.&#160;<br/>
Overruled.”<br/>
Mr. Gilmer seemed as curious as the rest of us as to what bearing the state of Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ewell’s education had on the case.<br/>
“I’ll repeat the question,” said Atticus. “Can you read and write?”<br/>
“I most positively can.”<br/>
“Will you write your name and show us?”<br/>
“I most positively will. How do you think I sign my relief checks?”<br/>
Mr. Ewell was endearing himself to his fellow citizens. The whispers and&#160;<br/>
chuckles below us probably had to do with what a card he was.<br/>
I was becoming nervous. Atticus seemed to know what he was doing—but it&#160;<br/>
seemed to me that he’d gone frog-sticking without a light. Never, never, never, on&#160;<br/>
cross-examination ask a witness a question you don’t already know the answer to,&#160;<br/>
was a tenet I absorbed with my baby-food. Do it, and you’ll often get an answer&#160;<br/>
you don’t want, an answer that might wreck your case.<br/>
Atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat. He drew out an envelope,&#160;<br/>
then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen. He moved&#160;<br/>
leisurely, and had turned so that he was in full view of the jury. He unscrewed the&#160;<br/>
fountain-pen cap and placed it gently on his table. He shook the pen a little, then&#160;<br/>
handed it with the envelope to the witness. “Would you write your name for us?”&#160;<br/>
he asked. “Clearly now, so the jury can see you do it.”<br/>
Mr. Ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up complacently to see&#160;<br/>
Judge Taylor staring at him as if he were some fragrant gardenia in full bloom on&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=180></a>the witness stand, to see Mr. Gilmer half-sitting, half-standing at his table. The&#160;<br/>
jury was watching him, one man was leaning forward with his hands over the&#160;<br/>
railing.<br/>
“What’s so interestin‘?” he asked.<br/>
“You’re left-handed, Mr. Ewell,” said Judge Taylor. Mr. Ewell turned angrily to&#160;<br/>
the judge and said he didn’t see what his being left-handed had to do with it, that&#160;<br/>
he was a Christ-fearing man and Atticus Finch was taking advantage of him.&#160;<br/>
Tricking lawyers like Atticus Finch took advantage of him all the time with their&#160;<br/>
tricking ways. He had told them what happened, he’d say it again and again—<br/>
which he did. Nothing Atticus asked him after that shook his story, that he’d&#160;<br/>
looked through the window, then ran the nigger off, then ran for the sheriff.&#160;<br/>
Atticus finally dismissed him.<br/>
Mr. Gilmer asked him one more question. “About your writing with your left&#160;<br/>
hand, are you ambidextrous, Mr. Ewell?”<br/>
“I most positively am not, I can use one hand good as the other. One hand good as&#160;<br/>
the other,” he added, glaring at the defense table.<br/>
Jem seemed to be having a quiet fit. He was pounding the balcony rail softly, and&#160;<br/>
once he whispered, “We’ve got him.”<br/>
I didn’t think so: Atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that Mr. Ewell&#160;<br/>
could have beaten up Mayella. That much I could follow. If her right eye was&#160;<br/>
blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to&#160;<br/>
show that a left-handed person did it. Sherlock Holmes and Jem Finch would&#160;<br/>
agree. But Tom Robinson could easily be left-handed, too. Like Mr. Heck Tate, I&#160;<br/>
imagined a person facing me, went through a swift mental pantomime, and&#160;<br/>
concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with&#160;<br/>
his left. I looked down at him. His back was to us, but I could see his broad&#160;<br/>
shoulders and bull-thick neck. He could easily have done it. I thought Jem was&#160;<br/>
counting his chickens.<br/>

<b>Chapter 18</b><br/>
But someone was booming again.<br/>
“Mayella Violet Ewell—!”<br/>
A young girl walked to the witness stand. As she raised her hand and swore that&#160;<br/>
the evidence she gave would be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the&#160;<br/>
truth so help her God, she seemed somehow fragile-looking, but when she sat&#160;<br/>
facing us in the witness chair she became what she was, a thick-bodied girl&#160;<br/>
accustomed to strenuous labor.<br/>
In Maycomb County, it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly, as&#160;<br/>
opposed to yearly lavations: Mr. Ewell had a scalded look; as if an overnight&#160;<br/>
soaking had deprived him of protective layers of dirt, his skin appeared to be&#160;<br/>
sensitive to the elements. Mayella looked as if she tried to keep clean, and I was&#160;<br/>
reminded of the row of red geraniums in the Ewell yard.<br/>
Mr. Gilmer asked Mayella to tell the jury in her own words what happened on the&#160;<br/>
evening of November twenty-first of last year, just in her own words, please.<br/>
Mayella sat silently.<br/>
“Where were you at dusk on that evening?” began Mr. Gilmer patiently.<br/>
“On the porch.”<br/>
“Which porch?”<br/>
“Ain’t but one, the front porch.”<br/>
“What were you doing on the porch?”<br/>
“Nothin‘.”<br/>
Judge Taylor said, “Just tell us what happened. You can do that, can’t you?”<br/>
Mayella stared at him and burst into tears. She covered her mouth with her hands&#160;<br/>
and sobbed. Judge Taylor let her cry for a while, then he said, “That’s enough&#160;<br/>
now. Don’t be ‘fraid of anybody here, as long as you tell the truth. All this is&#160;<br/>
strange to you, I know, but you’ve nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=182></a>What are you scared of?”<br/>
Mayella said something behind her hands. “What was that?” asked the judge.<br/>
“Him,” she sobbed, pointing at Atticus.<br/>
“Mr. Finch?”<br/>
She nodded vigorously, saying, “Don’t want him doin‘ me like he done Papa,&#160;<br/>
tryin’ to make him out lefthanded…”<br/>
Judge Taylor scratched his thick white hair. It was plain that he had never been&#160;<br/>
confronted with a problem of this kind. “How old are you?” he asked.<br/>
“Nineteen-and-a-half,” Mayella said.<br/>
Judge Taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing&#160;<br/>
tones. “Mr. Finch has no idea of scaring you,” he growled, “and if he did, I’m&#160;<br/>
here to stop him. That’s one thing I’m sitting up here for. Now you’re a big girl,&#160;<br/>
so you just sit up straight and tell the—tell us what happened to you. You can do&#160;<br/>
that, can’t you?”<br/>
I whispered to Jem, “Has she got good sense?”<br/>
Jem was squinting down at the witness stand. “Can’t tell yet,” he said. “She’s got&#160;<br/>
enough sense to get the judge sorry for her, but she might be just—oh, I don’t&#160;<br/>
know.”<br/>
Mollified, Mayella gave Atticus a final terrified glance and said to Mr. Gilmer,&#160;<br/>
“Well sir, I was on the porch and—and he came along and, you see, there was this&#160;<br/>
old chiffarobe in the yard Papa’d brought in to chop up for kindlin‘—Papa told&#160;<br/>
me to do it while he was off in the woods but I wadn’t feelin’ strong enough then,&#160;<br/>
so he came by-”<br/>
“Who is ‘he’?”<br/>
Mayella pointed to Tom Robinson. “I’ll have to ask you to be more specific,&#160;<br/>
please,” said Mr. Gilmer. “The reporter can’t put down gestures very well.”<br/>
“That’n yonder,” she said. “Robinson.”<br/>
“Then what happened?”<br/>
“I said come here, nigger, and bust up this chiffarobe for me, I gotta nickel for&#160;<br/>
you. He coulda done it easy enough, he could. So he come in the yard an‘ I went&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=183></a>in the house to get him the nickel and I turned around an ’fore I knew it he was on&#160;<br/>
me. Just run up behind me, he did. He got me round the neck, cussin‘ me an’&#160;<br/>
sayin‘ dirt—I fought’n’hollered, but he had me round the neck. He hit me agin&#160;<br/>
an‘ agin—”<br/>
Mr. Gilmer waited for Mayella to collect herself: she had twisted her&#160;<br/>
handkerchief into a sweaty rope; when she opened it to wipe her face it was a&#160;<br/>
mass of creases from her hot hands. She waited for Mr. Gilmer to ask another&#160;<br/>
question, but when he didn’t, she said, “-he chunked me on the floor an‘ choked&#160;<br/>
me’n took advantage of me.”<br/>
“Did you scream?” asked Mr. Gilmer. “Did you scream and fight back?”<br/>
“Reckon I did, hollered for all I was worth, kicked and hollered loud as I could.”<br/>
“Then what happened?”<br/>
“I don’t remember too good, but next thing I knew Papa was in the room&#160;<br/>
a’standing over me hollerin‘ who done it, who done it? Then I sorta fainted an’&#160;<br/>
the next thing I knew Mr. Tate was pullin‘ me up offa the floor and leadin’ me to&#160;<br/>
the water bucket.”<br/>
Apparently Mayella’s recital had given her confidence, but it was not her father’s&#160;<br/>
brash kind: there was something stealthy about hers, like a steady-eyed cat with a&#160;<br/>
twitchy tail.<br/>
“You say you fought him off as hard as you could? Fought him tooth and nail?”&#160;<br/>
asked Mr. Gilmer.<br/>
“I positively did,” Mayella echoed her father.<br/>
“You are positive that he took full advantage of you?”<br/>
Mayella’s face contorted, and I was afraid that she would cry again. Instead, she&#160;<br/>
said, “He done what he was after.”<br/>
Mr. Gilmer called attention to the hot day by wiping his head with his hand.&#160;<br/>
“That’s all for the time being,” he said pleasantly, “but you stay there. I expect&#160;<br/>
big bad Mr. Finch has some questions to ask you.”<br/>
“State will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defense,” murmured&#160;<br/>
Judge Taylor primly, “at least not at this time.”<br/>
Atticus got up grinning but instead of walking to the witness stand, he opened his&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=184></a>coat and hooked his thumbs in his vest, then he walked slowly across the room to&#160;<br/>
the windows. He looked out, but didn’t seem especially interested in what he saw,&#160;<br/>
then he turned and strolled back to the witness stand. From long years of&#160;<br/>
experience, I could tell he was trying to come to a decision about something.<br/>
“Miss Mayella,” he said, smiling, “I won’t try to scare you for a while, not yet.&#160;<br/>
Let’s just get acquainted. How old are you?”<br/>
“Said I was nineteen, said it to the judge yonder.” Mayella jerked her head&#160;<br/>
resentfully at the bench.<br/>
“So you did, so you did, ma’am. You’ll have to bear with me, Miss Mayella, I’m&#160;<br/>
getting along and can’t remember as well as I used to. I might ask you things&#160;<br/>
you’ve already said before, but you’ll give me an answer, won’t you? Good.”<br/>
I could see nothing in Mayella’s expression to justify Atticus’s assumption that he&#160;<br/>
had secured her wholehearted cooperation. She was looking at him furiously.<br/>
“Won’t answer a word you say long as you keep on mockin‘ me,” she said.<br/>
“Ma’am?” asked Atticus, startled.<br/>
“Long’s you keep on makin‘ fun o’me.”<br/>
Judge Taylor said, “Mr. Finch is not making fun of you. What’s the matter with&#160;<br/>
you?”<br/>
Mayella looked from under lowered eyelids at Atticus, but she said to the judge:&#160;<br/>
“Long’s he keeps on callin‘ me ma’am an sayin’ Miss Mayella. I don’t hafta take&#160;<br/>
his sass, I ain’t called upon to take it.”<br/>
Atticus resumed his stroll to the windows and let Judge Taylor handle this one.&#160;<br/>
Judge Taylor was not the kind of figure that ever evoked pity, but I did feel a&#160;<br/>
pang for him as he tried to explain. “That’s just Mr. Finch’s way,” he told&#160;<br/>
Mayella. “We’ve done business in this court for years and years, and Mr. Finch is&#160;<br/>
always courteous to everybody. He’s not trying to mock you, he’s trying to be&#160;<br/>
polite. That’s just his way.”<br/>
The judge leaned back. “Atticus, let’s get on with these proceedings, and let the&#160;<br/>
record show that the witness has not been sassed, her views to the contrary.”<br/>
I wondered if anybody had ever called her “ma’am,” or “Miss Mayella” in her&#160;<br/>
life; probably not, as she took offense to routine courtesy. What on earth was her&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=185></a>life like? I soon found out.<br/>
“You say you’re nineteen,” Atticus resumed. “How many sisters and brothers&#160;<br/>
have you?” He walked from the windows back to the stand.<br/>
“Seb’m,” she said, and I wondered if they were all like the specimen I had seen&#160;<br/>
the first day I started to school.<br/>
“You the eldest? The oldest?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“How long has your mother been dead?”<br/>
“Don’t know—long time.”<br/>
“Did you ever go to school?”<br/>
“Read’n‘write good as Papa yonder.”<br/>
Mayella sounded like a Mr. Jingle in a book I had been reading.<br/>
“How long did you go to school?”<br/>
“Two year—three year—dunno.”<br/>
Slowly but surely I began to see the pattern of Atticus’s questions: from questions&#160;<br/>
that Mr. Gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to,&#160;<br/>
Atticus was quietly building up before the jury a picture of the Ewells’ home life.&#160;<br/>
The jury learned the following things: their relief check was far from enough to&#160;<br/>
feed the family, and there was strong suspicion that Papa drank it up anyway—he&#160;<br/>
sometimes went off in the swamp for days and came home sick; the weather was&#160;<br/>
seldom cold enough to require shoes, but when it was, you could make dandy&#160;<br/>
ones from strips of old tires; the family hauled its water in buckets from a spring&#160;<br/>
that ran out at one end of the dump—they kept the surrounding area clear of trash<br/>
—and it was everybody for himself as far as keeping clean went: if you wanted to&#160;<br/>
wash you hauled your own water; the younger children had perpetual colds and&#160;<br/>
suffered from chronic ground-itch; there was a lady who came around sometimes&#160;<br/>
and asked Mayella why she didn’t stay in school—she wrote down the answer;&#160;<br/>
with two members of the family reading and writing, there was no need for the&#160;<br/>
rest of them to learn—Papa needed them at home.<br/>
“Miss Mayella,” said Atticus, in spite of himself, “a nineteen-year-old girl like&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=186></a>you must have friends. Who are your friends?”<br/>
The witness frowned as if puzzled. “Friends?”<br/>
“Yes, don’t you know anyone near your age, or older, or younger? Boys and&#160;<br/>
girls? Just ordinary friends?”<br/>
Mayella’s hostility, which had subsided to grudging neutrality, flared again. “You&#160;<br/>
makin‘ fun o’me agin, Mr. Finch?”<br/>
Atticus let her question answer his<br/>
.&#160;<br/>
“Do you love your father, Miss Mayella?” was his next.<br/>
“Love him, whatcha mean?”<br/>
“I mean, is he good to you, is he easy to get along with?”<br/>
“He does tollable, ‘cept when—”<br/>
“Except when?”<br/>
Mayella looked at her father, who was sitting with his chair tipped against the&#160;<br/>
railing. He sat up straight and waited for her to answer.<br/>
“Except when nothin‘,” said Mayella. “I said he does tollable.”<br/>
Mr. Ewell leaned back again.<br/>
“Except when he’s drinking?” asked Atticus so gently that Mayella nodded.<br/>
“Does he ever go after you?”<br/>
“How you mean?”<br/>
“When he’s—riled, has he ever beaten you?”<br/>
Mayella looked around, down at the court reporter, up at the judge. “Answer the&#160;<br/>
question, Miss Mayella,” said Judge Taylor.<br/>
“My paw’s never touched a hair o’my head in my life,” she declared firmly. “He&#160;<br/>
never touched me.”<br/>
Atticus’s glasses had slipped a little, and he pushed them up on his nose. “We’ve&#160;<br/>
had a good visit, Miss Mayella, and now I guess we’d better get to the case. You&#160;<br/>
say you asked Tom Robinson to come chop up a—what was it?”<br/>
“A chiffarobe, a old dresser full of drawers on one side.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=187></a>“Was Tom Robinson well known to you?”<br/>
“Whaddya mean?”<br/>
“I mean did you know who he was, where he lived?”<br/>
Mayella nodded. “I knowed who he was, he passed the house every day.”<br/>
“Was this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence?”<br/>
Mayella jumped slightly at the question. Atticus was making his slow pilgrimage&#160;<br/>
to the windows, as he had been doing: he would ask a question, then look out,&#160;<br/>
waiting for an answer. He did not see her involuntary jump, but it seemed to me&#160;<br/>
that he knew she had moved. He turned around and raised his eyebrows. “Was—”&#160;<br/>
he began again.<br/>
“Yes it was.”<br/>
“Didn’t you ever ask him to come inside the fence before?”<br/>
She was prepared now. “I did not, I certainly did not.”<br/>
“One did not’s enough,” said Atticus serenely. “You never asked him to do odd&#160;<br/>
jobs for you before?”<br/>
“I mighta,” conceded Mayella. “There was several niggers around.”<br/>
“Can you remember any other occasions?”<br/>
“No.”<br/>
“All right, now to what happened. You said Tom Robinson was behind you in the&#160;<br/>
room when you turned around, that right?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“You said he ‘got you around the neck cussing and saying dirt’—is that right?”<br/>
“‘t’s right.”<br/>
Atticus’s memory had suddenly become accurate. “You say ‘he caught me and&#160;<br/>
choked me and took advantage of me’—is that right?”<br/>
“That’s what I said.”<br/>
“Do you remember him beating you about the face?”<br/>
The witness hesitated.<br/>
“You seem sure enough that he choked you. All this time you were fighting back,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=188></a>remember? You ‘kicked and hollered as loud as you could.’ Do you remember&#160;<br/>
him beating you about the face?”<br/>
Mayella was silent. She seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself. I&#160;<br/>
thought for a moment she was doing Mr. Heck Tate’s and my trick of pretending&#160;<br/>
there was a person in front of us. She glanced at Mr. Gilmer.<br/>
“It’s an easy question, Miss Mayella, so I’ll try again. Do you remember him&#160;<br/>
beating you about the face?” Atticus’s voice had lost its comfortableness; he was&#160;<br/>
speaking in his arid, detached professional voice. “Do you remember him beating&#160;<br/>
you about the face?”<br/>
“No, I don’t recollect if he hit me. I mean yes I do, he hit me.”<br/>
“Was your last sentence your answer?”<br/>
“Huh? Yes, he hit—I just don’t remember, I just don’t remember… it all&#160;<br/>
happened so quick.”<br/>
Judge Taylor looked sternly at Mayella. “Don’t you cry, young woman—” he&#160;<br/>
began, but Atticus said, “Let her cry if she wants to, Judge. We’ve got all the time&#160;<br/>
in the world.”<br/>
Mayella sniffed wrathfully and looked at Atticus. “I’ll answer any question you&#160;<br/>
got—get me up here an‘ mock me, will you? I’ll answer any question you got—”<br/>
“That’s fine,” said Atticus. “There’re only a few more. Miss Mayella, not to be&#160;<br/>
tedious, you’ve testified that the defendant hit you, grabbed you around the neck,&#160;<br/>
choked you, and took advantage of you. I want you to be sure you have the right&#160;<br/>
man. Will you identify the man who raped you?”<br/>
“I will, that’s him right yonder.”<br/>
Atticus turned to the defendant. “Tom, stand up. Let Miss Mayella have a good&#160;<br/>
long look at you. Is this the man, Miss Mayella?”<br/>
Tom Robinson’s powerful shoulders rippled under his thin shirt. He rose to his&#160;<br/>
feet and stood with his right hand on the back of his chair. He looked oddly off&#160;<br/>
balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. His left arm was fully&#160;<br/>
twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. It ended in a small&#160;<br/>
shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony I could see that it was no use&#160;<br/>
to him.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=189></a>“Scout,” breathed Jem. “Scout, look! Reverend, he’s crippled!”<br/>
Reverend Sykes leaned across me and whispered to Jem. “He got it caught in a&#160;<br/>
cotton gin, caught it in Mr. Dolphus Raymond’s cotton gin when he was a boy…&#160;<br/>
like to bled to death… tore all the muscles loose from his bones—”<br/>
Atticus said, “Is this the man who raped you?”<br/>
“It most certainly is.”<br/>
Atticus’s next question was one word long. “How?”<br/>
Mayella was raging. “I don’t know how he done it, but he done it—I said it all&#160;<br/>
happened so fast I—”<br/>
“Now let’s consider this calmly—” began Atticus, but Mr. Gilmer interrupted&#160;<br/>
with an objection: he was not irrelevant or immaterial, but Atticus was&#160;<br/>
browbeating the witness.<br/>
Judge Taylor laughed outright. “Oh sit down, Horace, he’s doing nothing of the&#160;<br/>
sort. If anything, the witness’s browbeating Atticus.”<br/>
Judge Taylor was the only person in the courtroom who laughed. Even the babies&#160;<br/>
were still, and I suddenly wondered if they had been smothered at their mothers’&#160;<br/>
breasts.<br/>
“Now,” said Atticus, “Miss Mayella, you’ve testified that the defendant choked&#160;<br/>
and beat you—you didn’t say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you&#160;<br/>
cold, but you turned around and there he was—” Atticus was back behind his&#160;<br/>
table, and he emphasized his words by tapping his knuckles on it. “—do you wish&#160;<br/>
to reconsider any of your testimony?”<br/>
“You want me to say something that didn’t happen?”<br/>
“No ma’am, I want you to say something that did happen. Tell us once more,&#160;<br/>
please, what happened?”<br/>
“I told’ja what happened.”<br/>
“You testified that you turned around and there he was. He choked you then?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“Then he released your throat and hit you?”<br/>
“I said he did.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=190></a>“He blacked your left eye with his right fist?”<br/>
“I ducked and it—it glanced, that’s what it did. I ducked and it glanced off.”&#160;<br/>
Mayella had finally seen the light.<br/>
“You’re becoming suddenly clear on this point. A while ago you couldn’t&#160;<br/>
remember too well, could you?”<br/>
“I said he hit me.”<br/>
“All right. He choked you, he hit you, then he raped you, that right?”<br/>
“It most certainly is.”<br/>
“You’re a strong girl, what were you doing all the time, just standing there?”<br/>
“I told’ja I hollered’n‘kicked’n’fought—”<br/>
Atticus reached up and took off his glasses, turned his good right eye to the&#160;<br/>
witness, and rained questions on her. Judge Taylor said, “One question at a time,&#160;<br/>
Atticus. Give the witness a chance to answer.”<br/>
“All right, why didn’t you run?”<br/>
“I tried…”<br/>
“Tried to? What kept you from it?”<br/>
“I—he slung me down. That’s what he did, he slung me down’n got on top of&#160;<br/>
me.”<br/>
“You were screaming all this time?”<br/>
“I certainly was.”<br/>
“Then why didn’t the other children hear you? Where were they? At the dump?”<br/>
“Where were they?”<br/>
No answer.<br/>
“Why didn’t your screams make them come running? The dump’s closer than the&#160;<br/>
woods, isn’t it?”<br/>
No answer.<br/>
“Or didn’t you scream until you saw your father in the window? You didn’t think&#160;<br/>
to scream until then, did you?”<br/>
No answer.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=191></a>“Did you scream first at your father instead of at Tom Robinson? Was that it?”<br/>
No answer.<br/>
“Who beat you up? Tom Robinson or your father?”<br/>
No answer.<br/>
“What did your father see in the window, the crime of rape or the best defense to&#160;<br/>
it? Why don’t you tell the truth, child, didn’t Bob Ewell beat you up?”<br/>
When Atticus turned away from Mayella he looked like his stomach hurt, but&#160;<br/>
Mayella’s face was a mixture of terror and fury. Atticus sat down wearily and&#160;<br/>
polished his glasses with his handkerchief.<br/>
Suddenly Mayella became articulate. “I got somethin‘ to say,” she said.<br/>
Atticus raised his head. “Do you want to tell us what happened?”<br/>
But she did not hear the compassion in his invitation. “I got somethin‘ to say an’&#160;<br/>
then I ain’t gonna say no more. That nigger yonder took advantage of me an‘ if&#160;<br/>
you fine fancy gentlemen don’t wanta do nothin’ about it then you’re all yellow&#160;<br/>
stinkin‘ cowards, stinkin’ cowards, the lot of you. Your fancy airs don’t come to&#160;<br/>
nothin‘—your ma’amin’ and Miss Mayellerin‘ don’t come to nothin’, Mr. Finch<br/>
—”<br/>
Then she burst into real tears. Her shoulders shook with angry sobs. She was as&#160;<br/>
good as her word. She answered no more questions, even when Mr. Gilmer tried&#160;<br/>
to get her back on the track. I guess if she hadn’t been so poor and ignorant, Judge&#160;<br/>
Taylor would have put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown&#160;<br/>
everybody in the courtroom. Somehow, Atticus had hit her hard in a way that was&#160;<br/>
not clear to me, but it gave him no pleasure to do so. He sat with his head down,&#160;<br/>
and I never saw anybody glare at anyone with the hatred Mayella showed when&#160;<br/>
she left the stand and walked by Atticus’s table.<br/>
When Mr. Gilmer told Judge Taylor that the state rested, Judge Taylor said, “It’s&#160;<br/>
time we all did. We’ll take ten minutes.”<br/>
Atticus and Mr. Gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered, then they left the&#160;<br/>
courtroom by a door behind the witness stand, which was a signal for us all to&#160;<br/>
stretch. I discovered that I had been sitting on the edge of the long bench, and I&#160;<br/>
was somewhat numb. Jem got up and yawned, Dill did likewise, and Reverend&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=192></a>Sykes wiped his face on his hat. The temperature was an easy ninety, he said.<br/>
Mr. Braxton Underwood, who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the&#160;<br/>
Press, soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain, allowed his bitter eyes to&#160;<br/>
rove over the colored balcony, and they met mine. He gave a snort and looked&#160;<br/>
away.<br/>
“Jem,” I said, “Mr. Underwood’s seen us.”<br/>
“That’s okay. He won’t tell Atticus, he’ll just put it on the social side of the&#160;<br/>
<i>Tribune</i>.” Jem turned back to Dill, explaining, I suppose, the finer points of the&#160;<br/>
trial to him, but I wondered what they were. There had been no lengthy debates&#160;<br/>
between Atticus and Mr. Gilmer on any points; Mr. Gilmer seemed to be&#160;<br/>
prosecuting almost reluctantly; witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are,&#160;<br/>
with few objections. But Atticus had once told us that in Judge Taylor’s court any&#160;<br/>
lawyer who was a strict constructionist on evidence usually wound up receiving&#160;<br/>
strict instructions from the bench. He distilled this for me to mean that Judge&#160;<br/>
Taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep, but he was seldom reversed, and&#160;<br/>
that was the proof of the pudding. Atticus said he was a good judge.<br/>
Presently Judge Taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair. He took a cigar&#160;<br/>
from his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully. I punched Dill. Having passed&#160;<br/>
the judge’s inspection, the cigar suffered a vicious bite. “We come down&#160;<br/>
sometimes to watch him,” I explained. “It’s gonna take him the rest of the&#160;<br/>
afternoon, now. You watch.” Unaware of public scrutiny from above, Judge&#160;<br/>
Taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lips and saying,&#160;<br/>
“Fhluck!” He hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh. “Bet he was hell&#160;<br/>
with a spitball,” murmured Dill.<br/>
As a rule, a recess meant a general exodus, but today people weren’t moving.&#160;<br/>
Even the Idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had&#160;<br/>
remained standing along the walls. I guess Mr. Heck Tate had reserved the county&#160;<br/>
toilet for court officials.<br/>
Atticus and Mr. Gilmer returned, and Judge Taylor looked at his watch. “It’s&#160;<br/>
gettin‘ on to four,” he said, which was intriguing, as the courthouse clock must&#160;<br/>
have struck the hour at least twice. I had not heard it or felt its vibrations.<br/>
“Shall we try to wind up this afternoon?” asked Judge Taylor. “How ‘bout it,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=193></a>Atticus?”<br/>
“I think we can,” said Atticus.<br/>
“How many witnesses you got?”<br/>
“One.”<br/>
“Well, call him.”<br/>

<b>Chapter 19</b><br/>
Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it.&#160;<br/>
He guided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with&#160;<br/>
the black binding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the&#160;<br/>
Bible and hit the clerk’s table. He was trying again when Judge Taylor growled,&#160;<br/>
“That’ll do, Tom.” Tom took the oath and stepped into the witness chair. Atticus&#160;<br/>
very quickly induced him to tell us:<br/>
Tom was twenty-five years of age; he was married with three children; he had&#160;<br/>
been in trouble with the law before: he once received thirty days for disorderly&#160;<br/>
conduct.<br/>
“It must have been disorderly,” said Atticus. “What did it consist of?”<br/>
“Got in a fight with another man, he tried to cut me.”<br/>
“Did he succeed?”<br/>
“Yes suh, a little, not enough to hurt. You see, I—” Tom moved his left shoulder.<br/>
“Yes,” said Atticus. “You were both convicted?”<br/>
“Yes suh, I had to serve ‘cause I couldn’t pay the fine. Other fellow paid his’n.”<br/>
Dill leaned across me and asked Jem what Atticus was doing. Jem said Atticus&#160;<br/>
was showing the jury that Tom had nothing to hide.<br/>
“Were you acquainted with Mayella Violet Ewell?” asked Atticus.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=194></a>“Yes suh, I had to pass her place goin‘ to and from the field every day.”<br/>
“Whose field?”<br/>
“I picks for Mr. Link Deas.”<br/>
“Were you picking cotton in November?”<br/>
“No suh, I works in his yard fall an‘ wintertime. I works pretty steady for him all&#160;<br/>
year round, he’s got a lot of pecan trees’n things.”<br/>
“You say you had to pass the Ewell place to get to and from work. Is there any&#160;<br/>
other way to go?”<br/>
“No suh, none’s I know of.”<br/>
“Tom, did she ever speak to you?”<br/>
“Why, yes suh, I’d tip m’hat when I’d go by, and one day she asked me to come&#160;<br/>
inside the fence and bust up a chiffarobe for her.”<br/>
“When did she ask you to chop up the—the chiffarobe?”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, it was way last spring. I remember it because it was choppin‘ time&#160;<br/>
and I had my hoe with me. I said I didn’t have nothin’ but this hoe, but she said&#160;<br/>
she had a hatchet. She give me the hatchet and I broke up the chiffarobe. She said,&#160;<br/>
‘I reckon I’ll hafta give you a nickel, won’t I?’ an‘ I said, ’No ma’am, there ain’t&#160;<br/>
no charge.‘ Then I went home. Mr. Finch, that was way last spring, way over a&#160;<br/>
year ago.”<br/>
“Did you ever go on the place again?”<br/>
“Yes suh.”<br/>
“When?”<br/>
“Well, I went lots of times.”<br/>
Judge Taylor instinctively reached for his gavel, but let his hand fall. The murmur&#160;<br/>
below us died without his help.<br/>
“Under what circumstances?”<br/>
“Please, suh?”<br/>
“Why did you go inside the fence lots of times?”<br/>
Tom Robinson’s forehead relaxed. “She’d call me in, suh. Seemed like every time&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=195></a>I passed by yonder she’d have some little somethin‘ for me to do—choppin’&#160;<br/>
kindlin‘, totin’ water for her. She watered them red flowers every day—”<br/>
“Were you paid for your services?”<br/>
“No suh, not after she offered me a nickel the first time. I was glad to do it, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ewell didn’t seem to help her none, and neither did the chillun, and I knowed she&#160;<br/>
didn’t have no nickels to spare.”<br/>
“Where were the other children?”<br/>
“They was always around, all over the place. They’d watch me work, some of&#160;<br/>
‘em, some of ’em’d set in the window.”<br/>
“Would Miss Mayella talk to you?”<br/>
“Yes sir, she talked to me.”<br/>
As Tom Robinson gave his testimony, it came to me that Mayella Ewell must&#160;<br/>
have been the loneliest person in the world. She was even lonelier than Boo&#160;<br/>
Radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years. When Atticus&#160;<br/>
asked had she any friends, she seemed not to know what he meant, then she&#160;<br/>
thought he was making fun of her. She was as sad, I thought, as what Jem called a&#160;<br/>
mixed child: white people wouldn’t have anything to do with her because she&#160;<br/>
lived among pigs; Negroes wouldn’t have anything to do with her because she&#160;<br/>
was white. She couldn’t live like Mr. Dolphus Raymond, who preferred the&#160;<br/>
company of Negroes, because she didn’t own a riverbank and she wasn’t from a&#160;<br/>
fine old family. Nobody said, “That’s just their way,” about the Ewells. Maycomb&#160;<br/>
gave them Christmas baskets, welfare money, and the back of its hand. Tom&#160;<br/>
Robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her. But she said&#160;<br/>
he took advantage of her, and when she stood up she looked at him as if he were&#160;<br/>
dirt beneath her feet.<br/>
“Did you ever,” Atticus interrupted my meditations, “at any time, go on the Ewell&#160;<br/>
property—did you ever set foot on the Ewell property without an express&#160;<br/>
invitation from one of them?”<br/>
“No suh, Mr. Finch, I never did. I wouldn’t do that, suh.”<br/>
Atticus sometimes said that one way to tell whether a witness was lying or telling&#160;<br/>
the truth was to listen rather than watch: I applied his test—Tom denied it three&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=196></a>times in one breath, but quietly, with no hint of whining in his voice, and I found&#160;<br/>
myself believing him in spite of his protesting too much. He seemed to be a&#160;<br/>
respectable Negro, and a respectable Negro would never go up into somebody’s&#160;<br/>
yard of his own volition.<br/>
“Tom, what happened to you on the evening of November twenty-first of last&#160;<br/>
year?”<br/>
Below us, the spectators drew a collective breath and leaned forward. Behind us,&#160;<br/>
the Negroes did the same.<br/>
Tom was a black-velvet Negro, not shiny, but soft black velvet. The whites of his&#160;<br/>
eyes shone in his face, and when he spoke we saw flashes of his teeth. If he had&#160;<br/>
been whole, he would have been a fine specimen of a man.<br/>
“Mr. Finch,” he said, “I was goin‘ home as usual that evenin’, an‘ when I passed&#160;<br/>
the Ewell place Miss Mayella were on the porch, like she said she were. It seemed&#160;<br/>
real quiet like, an’ I didn’t quite know why. I was studyin‘ why, just passin’ by,&#160;<br/>
when she says for me to come there and help her a minute. Well, I went inside the&#160;<br/>
fence an‘ looked around for some kindlin’ to work on, but I didn’t see none, and&#160;<br/>
she says, ‘Naw, I got somethin’ for you to do in the house. Th‘ old door’s off its&#160;<br/>
hinges an’ fall’s comin‘ on pretty fast.’ I said you got a screwdriver, Miss&#160;<br/>
Mayella? She said she sho‘ had. Well, I went up the steps an’ she motioned me to&#160;<br/>
come inside, and I went in the front room an‘ looked at the door. I said Miss&#160;<br/>
Mayella, this door look all right. I pulled it back’n forth and those hinges was all&#160;<br/>
right. Then she shet the door in my face. Mr. Finch, I was wonderin’ why it was&#160;<br/>
so quiet like, an‘ it come to me that there weren’t a chile on the place, not a one of&#160;<br/>
’em, and I said Miss Mayella, where the chillun?”<br/>
Tom’s black velvet skin had begun to shine, and he ran his hand over his face.<br/>
“I say where the chillun?” he continued, “an‘ she says—she was laughin’, sort of<br/>
—she says they all gone to town to get ice creams. She says, ‘took me a slap year&#160;<br/>
to save seb’m nickels, but I done it. They all gone to town.’”<br/>
Tom’s discomfort was not from the humidity. “What did you say then, Tom?”&#160;<br/>
asked Atticus.<br/>
“I said somethin‘ like, why Miss Mayella, that’s right smart o’you to treat ’em.&#160;<br/>
An‘ she said, ’You think so?‘ I don’t think she understood what I was thinkin’—I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=197></a>meant it was smart of her to save like that, an‘ nice of her to treat em.”<br/>
“I understand you, Tom. Go on,” said Atticus.<br/>
“Well, I said I best be goin‘, I couldn’t do nothin’ for her, an‘ she says oh yes I&#160;<br/>
could, an’ I ask her what, and she says to just step on that chair yonder an‘ git that&#160;<br/>
box down from on top of the chiffarobe.”<br/>
“Not the same chiffarobe you busted up?” asked Atticus.<br/>
The witness smiled. “Naw suh, another one. Most as tall as the room. So I done&#160;<br/>
what she told me, an‘ I was just reachin’ when the next thing I knows she—she’d&#160;<br/>
grabbed me round the legs, grabbed me round th‘ legs, Mr. Finch. She scared me&#160;<br/>
so bad I hopped down an’ turned the chair over—that was the only thing, only&#160;<br/>
furniture, ‘sturbed in that room, Mr. Finch, when I left it. I swear ’fore God.”<br/>
“What happened after you turned the chair over?”<br/>
Tom Robinson had come to a dead stop. He glanced at Atticus, then at the jury,&#160;<br/>
then at Mr. Underwood sitting across the room.<br/>
“Tom, you’re sworn to tell the whole truth. Will you tell it?”<br/>
Tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth.<br/>
“What happened after that?”<br/>
“Answer the question,” said Judge Taylor. One-third of his cigar had vanished.<br/>
“Mr. Finch, I got down offa that chair an‘ turned around an’ she sorta jumped on&#160;<br/>
me.”<br/>
“Jumped on you? Violently?”<br/>
“No suh, she—she hugged me. She hugged me round the waist.”<br/>
This time Judge Taylor’s gavel came down with a bang, and as it did the overhead&#160;<br/>
lights went on in the courtroom. Darkness had not come, but the afternoon sun&#160;<br/>
had left the windows. Judge Taylor quickly restored order.<br/>
“Then what did she do?”<br/>
The witness swallowed hard. “She reached up an‘ kissed me ’side of th‘ face. She&#160;<br/>
says she never kissed a grown man before an’ she might as well kiss a nigger. She&#160;<br/>
says what her papa do to her don’t count. She says, ‘Kiss me back, nigger.’ I say&#160;<br/>
Miss Mayella lemme outa here an‘ tried to run but she got her back to the door&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=198></a>an’ I’da had to push her. I didn’t wanta harm her, Mr. Finch, an‘ I say lemme&#160;<br/>
pass, but just when I say it Mr. Ewell yonder hollered through th’ window.”<br/>
“What did he say?”<br/>
Tom Robinson swallowed again, and his eyes widened. “Somethin‘ not fittin’ to&#160;<br/>
say—not fittin‘ for these folks’n chillun to hear—”<br/>
“What did he say, Tom? You&#160;<i>must</i>&#160;tell the jury what he said.”<br/>
Tom Robinson shut his eyes tight. “He says you goddamn whore, I’ll kill ya.”<br/>
“Then what happened?”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, I was runnin‘ so fast I didn’t know what happened.”<br/>
“Tom, did you rape Mayella Ewell?”<br/>
“I did not, suh.”<br/>
“Did you harm her in any way?”<br/>
“I did not, suh.”<br/>
“Did you resist her advances?”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, I tried. I tried to ‘thout bein’ ugly to her. I didn’t wanta be ugly, I&#160;<br/>
didn’t wanta push her or nothin‘.”<br/>
It occurred to me that in their own way, Tom Robinson’s manners were as good&#160;<br/>
as Atticus’s. Until my father explained it to me later, I did not understand the&#160;<br/>
subtlety of Tom’s predicament: he would not have dared strike a white woman&#160;<br/>
under any circumstances and expect to live long, so he took the first opportunity&#160;<br/>
to run—a sure sign of guilt.<br/>
“Tom, go back once more to Mr. Ewell,” said Atticus. “Did he say anything to&#160;<br/>
you?”<br/>
“Not anything, suh. He mighta said somethin‘, but I weren’t there—”<br/>
“That’ll do,” Atticus cut in sharply. “What you did hear, who was he talking to?”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, he were talkin‘ and lookin’ at Miss Mayella.”<br/>
“Then you ran?”<br/>
“I sho‘ did, suh.”<br/>
“Why did you run?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=199></a>“I was scared, suh.”<br/>
“Why were you scared?”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, if you was a nigger like me, you’d be scared, too.”<br/>
Atticus sat down. Mr. Gilmer was making his way to the witness stand, but before&#160;<br/>
he got there Mr. Link Deas rose from the audience and announced:<br/>
“I just want the whole lot of you to know one thing right now. That boy’s worked&#160;<br/>
for me eight years an‘ I ain’t had a speck o’trouble outa him. Not a speck.”<br/>
“<i>Shut your mouth, sir!</i>” Judge Taylor was wide awake and roaring. He was also&#160;<br/>
pink in the face. His speech was miraculously unimpaired by his cigar. “Link&#160;<br/>
Deas,” he yelled, “if you have anything you want to say you can say it under oath&#160;<br/>
and at the proper time, but until then you get out of this room, you hear me? Get&#160;<br/>
out of this room, sir, you hear me? I’ll be damned if I’ll listen to this case again!”<br/>
Judge Taylor looked daggers at Atticus, as if daring him to speak, but Atticus had&#160;<br/>
ducked his head and was laughing into his lap. I remembered something he had&#160;<br/>
said about Judge Taylor’s ex cathedra remarks sometimes exceeding his duty, but&#160;<br/>
that few lawyers ever did anything about them. I looked at Jem, but Jem shook his&#160;<br/>
head. “It ain’t like one of the jurymen got up and started talking,” he said. “I think&#160;<br/>
it’d be different then. Mr. Link was just disturbin‘ the peace or something.”<br/>
Judge Taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written&#160;<br/>
down after Mr. Finch if you were a nigger like me you’d be scared too, and told&#160;<br/>
the jury to disregard the interruption. He looked suspiciously down the middle&#160;<br/>
aisle and waited, I suppose, for Mr. Link Deas to effect total departure. Then he&#160;<br/>
said, “Go ahead, Mr. Gilmer.”<br/>
“You were given thirty days once for disorderly conduct, Robinson?” asked Mr.&#160;<br/>
Gilmer.<br/>
“Yes suh.”<br/>
“What’d the nigger look like when you got through with him?”<br/>
“He beat me, Mr. Gilmer.”<br/>
“Yes, but you were convicted, weren’t you?”<br/>
Atticus raised his head. “It was a misdemeanor and it’s in the record, Judge.” I&#160;<br/>
thought he sounded tired.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=200></a>“Witness’ll answer, though,” said Judge Taylor, just as wearily.<br/>
“Yes suh, I got thirty days.”<br/>
I knew that Mr. Gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who was&#160;<br/>
convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take&#160;<br/>
advantage of Mayella Ewell, that was the only reason he cared. Reasons like that&#160;<br/>
helped.<br/>
“Robinson, you’re pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one&#160;<br/>
hand, aren’t you?”<br/>
“Yes, suh, I reckon so.”<br/>
“Strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor?”<br/>
“I never done that, suh.”<br/>
“But you are strong enough to?”<br/>
“I reckon so, suh.”<br/>
“Had your eye on her a long time, hadn’t you, boy?”<br/>
“No suh, I never looked at her.”<br/>
“Then you were mighty polite to do all that chopping and hauling for her, weren’t&#160;<br/>
you, boy?”<br/>
“I was just tryin‘ to help her out, suh.”<br/>
“That was mighty generous of you, you had chores at home after your regular&#160;<br/>
work, didn’t you?”<br/>
“Yes suh.”<br/>
“Why didn’t you do them instead of Miss Ewell’s?”<br/>
“I done ‘em both, suh.”<br/>
“You must have been pretty busy. Why?”<br/>
“Why what, suh?”<br/>
“Why were you so anxious to do that woman’s chores?”<br/>
Tom Robinson hesitated, searching for an answer. “Looked like she didn’t have&#160;<br/>
nobody to help her, like I says—”<br/>
“With Mr. Ewell and seven children on the place, boy?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=201></a>“Well, I says it looked like they never help her none—”<br/>
“You did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness, boy?”<br/>
“Tried to help her, I says.”<br/>
Mr. Gilmer smiled grimly at the jury. “You’re a mighty good fellow, it seems—<br/>
did all this for not one penny?”<br/>
“Yes, suh. I felt right sorry for her, she seemed to try more’n the rest of ‘em—”<br/>
“You felt sorry for&#160;<i>her</i>, you felt&#160;<i>sorry</i>&#160;for he?” Mr. Gilmer seemed ready to rise to&#160;<br/>
the ceiling.<br/>
The witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair. But the&#160;<br/>
damage was done. Below us, nobody liked Tom Robinson’s answer. Mr. Gilmer&#160;<br/>
paused a long time to let it sink in.<br/>
“Now you went by the house as usual, last November twenty-first,” he said, “and&#160;<br/>
she asked you to come in and bust up a chiffarobe?”<br/>
“No suh.”<br/>
“Do you deny that you went by the house?”<br/>
“No suh—she said she had somethin‘ for me to do inside the house—”<br/>
“She says she asked you to bust up a chiffarobe, is that right?”<br/>
“No suh, it ain’t.”<br/>
“Then you say she’s lying, boy?”<br/>
Atticus was on his feet, but Tom Robinson didn’t need him. “I don’t say she’s&#160;<br/>
lyin‘, Mr. Gilmer, I say she’s mistaken in her mind.”<br/>
To the next ten questions, as Mr. Gilmer reviewed Mayella’s version of events,&#160;<br/>
the witness’s steady answer was that she was mistaken in her mind.<br/>
“Didn’t Mr. Ewell run you off the place, boy?”<br/>
“No suh, I don’t think he did.”<br/>
“Don’t think, what do you mean?”<br/>
“I mean I didn’t stay long enough for him to run me off.”<br/>
“You’re very candid about this, why did you run so fast?”<br/>
“I says I was scared, suh.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=202></a>“If you had a clear conscience, why were you scared?”<br/>
“Like I says before, it weren’t safe for any nigger to be in a—fix like that.”<br/>
“But you weren’t in a fix—you testified that you were resisting Miss Ewell. Were&#160;<br/>
you so scared that she’d hurt you, you ran, a big buck like you?”<br/>
“No suh, I’s scared I’d be in court, just like I am now.”<br/>
“Scared of arrest, scared you’d have to face up to what you did?”<br/>
“No suh, scared I’d hafta face up to what I didn’t do.”<br/>
“Are you being impudent to me, boy?”<br/>
“No suh, I didn’t go to be.”<br/>
This was as much as I heard of Mr. Gilmer’s cross-examination, because Jem&#160;<br/>
made me take Dill out. For some reason Dill had started crying and couldn’t stop;&#160;<br/>
quietly at first, then his sobs were heard by several people in the balcony. Jem&#160;<br/>
said if I didn’t go with him he’d make me, and Reverend Sykes said I’d better go,&#160;<br/>
so I went. Dill had seemed to be all right that day, nothing wrong with him, but I&#160;<br/>
guessed he hadn’t fully recovered from running away.<br/>
“Ain’t you feeling good?” I asked, when we reached the bottom of the stairs.<br/>
Dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps. Mr. Link Deas&#160;<br/>
was a lonely figure on the top step. “Anything happenin‘, Scout?” he asked as we&#160;<br/>
went by. “No sir,” I answered over my shoulder. “Dill here, he’s sick.”<br/>
“Come on out under the trees,” I said. “Heat got you, I expect.” We chose the&#160;<br/>
fattest live oak and we sat under it.<br/>
“It was just him I couldn’t stand,” Dill said.<br/>
“Who, Tom?”<br/>
“That old Mr. Gilmer doin‘ him thataway, talking so hateful to him—”<br/>
“Dill, that’s his job. Why, if we didn’t have prosecutors—well, we couldn’t have&#160;<br/>
defense attorneys, I reckon.”<br/>
Dill exhaled patiently. “I know all that, Scout. It was the way he said it made me&#160;<br/>
sick, plain sick.”<br/>
“He’s supposed to act that way, Dill, he was cross—”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=203></a>“He didn’t act that way when—”<br/>
“Dill, those were his own witnesses.”<br/>
“Well, Mr. Finch didn’t act that way to Mayella and old man Ewell when he cross-<br/>
examined them. The way that man called him ‘boy’ all the time an‘ sneered at&#160;<br/>
him, an’ looked around at the jury every time he answered—”<br/>
“Well, Dill, after all he’s just a Negro.”<br/>
“I don’t care one speck. It ain’t right, somehow it ain’t right to do ‘em that way.&#160;<br/>
Hasn’t anybody got any business talkin’ like that—it just makes me sick.”<br/>
“That’s just Mr. Gilmer’s way, Dill, he does ‘em all that way. You’ve never seen&#160;<br/>
him get good’n down on one yet. Why, when—well, today Mr. Gilmer seemed to&#160;<br/>
me like he wasn’t half trying. They do ’em all that way, most lawyers, I mean.”<br/>
“Mr. Finch doesn’t.”<br/>
“He’s not an example, Dill, he’s—” I was trying to grope in my memory for a&#160;<br/>
sharp phrase of Miss Maudie Atkinson’s. I had it: “He’s the same in the&#160;<br/>
courtroom as he is on the public streets.”<br/>
“That’s not what I mean,” said Dill.<br/>
“I know what you mean, boy,” said a voice behind us. We thought it came from&#160;<br/>
the tree-trunk, but it belonged to Mr. Dolphus Raymond. He peered around the&#160;<br/>
trunk at us. “You aren’t thin-hided, it just makes you sick, doesn’t it?”<br/>
<a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#1">Contents&#160;-&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#193">Prev&#160;/&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#210">Next</a><br/>
<b>Chapter 20</b><br/>
“Come on round here, son, I got something that’ll settle your stomach.”<br/>
As Mr. Dolphus Raymond was an evil man I accepted his invitation reluctantly,&#160;<br/>
but I followed Dill. Somehow, I didn’t think Atticus would like it if we became&#160;<br/>
friendly with Mr. Raymond, and I knew Aunt Alexandra wouldn’t.<br/>
“Here,” he said, offering Dill his paper sack with straws in it. “Take a good sip,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=204></a>it’ll quieten you.”<br/>
Dill sucked on the straws, smiled, and pulled at length.<br/>
“Hee hee,” said Mr. Raymond, evidently taking delight in corrupting a child.<br/>
“Dill, you watch out, now,” I warned.<br/>
Dill released the straws and grinned. “Scout, it’s nothing but Coca-Cola.”<br/>
Mr. Raymond sat up against the tree-trunk. He had been lying on the grass. “You&#160;<br/>
little folks won’t tell on me now, will you? It’d ruin my reputation if you did.”<br/>
“You mean all you drink in that sack’s Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?”<br/>
“Yes ma’am,” Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses,&#160;<br/>
cottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. “That’s all I&#160;<br/>
drink, most of the time.”<br/>
“Then you just pretend you’re half—? I beg your pardon, sir,” I caught myself. “I&#160;<br/>
didn’t mean to be—”<br/>
Mr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet&#160;<br/>
question: “Why do you do like you do?”<br/>
“Wh—oh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, it’s very simple,” he said.&#160;<br/>
“Some folks don’t—like the way I live. Now I could say the hell with ‘em, I don’t&#160;<br/>
care if they don’t like it. I do say I don’t care if they don’t like it, right enough—<br/>
but I don’t say the hell with ’em, see?”<br/>
Dill and I said, “No sir.”<br/>
“I try to give ‘em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason.&#160;<br/>
When I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this&#160;<br/>
sack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond’s in the clutches of whiskey—that’s why&#160;<br/>
he won’t change his ways. He can’t help himself, that’s why he lives the way he&#160;<br/>
does.”<br/>
“That ain’t honest, Mr. Raymond, making yourself out badder’n you are already<br/>
—”<br/>
“It ain’t honest but it’s mighty helpful to folks. Secretly, Miss Finch, I’m not&#160;<br/>
much of a drinker, but you see they could never, never understand that I live like I&#160;<br/>
do because that’s the way I want to live.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=205></a>I had a feeling that I shouldn’t be here listening to this sinful man who had mixed&#160;<br/>
children and didn’t care who knew it, but he was fascinating. I had never&#160;<br/>
encountered a being who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself. But why&#160;<br/>
had he entrusted us with his deepest secret? I asked him why.<br/>
“Because you’re children and you can understand it,” he said, “and because I&#160;<br/>
heard that one—”<br/>
He jerked his head at Dill: “Things haven’t caught up with that one’s instinct yet.&#160;<br/>
Let him get a little older and he won’t get sick and cry. Maybe things’ll strike him&#160;<br/>
as being—not quite right, say, but he won’t cry, not when he gets a few years on&#160;<br/>
him.”<br/>
“Cry about what, Mr. Raymond?” Dill’s maleness was beginning to assert itself.<br/>
“Cry about the simple hell people give other people—without even thinking. Cry&#160;<br/>
about the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think that&#160;<br/>
they’re people, too.”<br/>
“Atticus says cheatin‘ a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin’ a white&#160;<br/>
man,” I muttered. “Says it’s the worst thing you can do.”<br/>
Mr. Raymond said, “I don’t reckon it’s—Miss Jean Louise, you don’t know your&#160;<br/>
pa’s not a run-of-the-mill man, it’ll take a few years for that to sink in—you&#160;<br/>
haven’t seen enough of the world yet. You haven’t even seen this town, but all&#160;<br/>
you gotta do is step back inside the courthouse.”<br/>
Which reminded me that we were missing nearly all of Mr. Gilmer’s cross-<br/>
examination. I looked at the sun, and it was dropping fast behind the store-tops on&#160;<br/>
the west side of the square. Between two fires, I could not decide which I wanted&#160;<br/>
to jump into: Mr. Raymond or the 5th Judicial Circuit Court. “C’mon, Dill,” I&#160;<br/>
said. “You all right, now?”<br/>
“Yeah. Glad t’ve metcha, Mr. Raymond, and thanks for the drink, it was mighty&#160;<br/>
settlin‘.”<br/>
We raced back to the courthouse, up the steps, up two flights of stairs, and edged&#160;<br/>
our way along the balcony rail. Reverend Sykes had saved our seats.<br/>
The courtroom was still, and again I wondered where the babies were. Judge&#160;<br/>
Taylor’s cigar was a brown speck in the center of his mouth; Mr. Gilmer was&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=206></a>writing on one of the yellow pads on his table, trying to outdo the court reporter,&#160;<br/>
whose hand was jerking rapidly. “Shoot,” I muttered, “we missed it.”<br/>
Atticus was halfway through his speech to the jury. He had evidently pulled some&#160;<br/>
papers from his briefcase that rested beside his chair, because they were on his&#160;<br/>
table. Tom Robinson was toying with them.<br/>
“…absence of any corroborative evidence, this man was indicted on a capital&#160;<br/>
charge and is now on trial for his life…”<br/>
I punched Jem. “How long’s he been at it?”<br/>
“He’s just gone over the evidence,” Jem whispered, “and we’re gonna win, Scout.&#160;<br/>
I don’t see how we can’t. He’s been at it ‘bout five minutes. He made it as plain&#160;<br/>
and easy as—well, as I’da explained it to you. You could’ve understood it, even.”<br/>
“Did Mr. Gilmer—?”<br/>
“Sh-h. Nothing new, just the usual. Hush now.”<br/>
We looked down again. Atticus was speaking easily, with the kind of detachment&#160;<br/>
he used when he dictated a letter. He walked slowly up and down in front of the&#160;<br/>
jury, and the jury seemed to be attentive: their heads were up, and they followed&#160;<br/>
Atticus’s route with what seemed to be appreciation. I guess it was because&#160;<br/>
Atticus wasn’t a thunderer.<br/>
Atticus paused, then he did something he didn’t ordinarily do. He unhitched his&#160;<br/>
watch and chain and placed them on the table, saying, “With the court’s&#160;<br/>
permission—”<br/>
Judge Taylor nodded, and then Atticus did something I never saw him do before&#160;<br/>
or since, in public or in private: he unbuttoned his vest, unbuttoned his collar,&#160;<br/>
loosened his tie, and took off his coat. He never loosened a scrap of his clothing&#160;<br/>
until he undressed at bedtime, and to Jem and me, this was the equivalent of him&#160;<br/>
standing before us stark naked. We exchanged horrified glances.<br/>
Atticus put his hands in his pockets, and as he returned to the jury, I saw his gold&#160;<br/>
collar button and the tips of his pen and pencil winking in the light.<br/>
“Gentlemen,” he said. Jem and I again looked at each other: Atticus might have&#160;<br/>
said, “Scout.” His voice had lost its aridity, its detachment, and he was talking to&#160;<br/>
the jury as if they were folks on the post office corner.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=207></a>“Gentlemen,” he was saying, “I shall be brief, but I would like to use my&#160;<br/>
remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one, it&#160;<br/>
requires no minute sifting of complicated facts, but it does require you to be sure&#160;<br/>
beyond all reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant. To begin with, this&#160;<br/>
case should never have come to trial. This case is as simple as black and white.<br/>
“The state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the&#160;<br/>
crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon&#160;<br/>
the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into&#160;<br/>
serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the&#160;<br/>
defendant. The defendant is not guilty, but somebody in this courtroom is.<br/>
“I have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state, but my pity&#160;<br/>
does not extend so far as to her putting a man’s life at stake, which she has done&#160;<br/>
in an effort to get rid of her own guilt.<br/>
“I say guilt, gentlemen, because it was guilt that motivated her. She has&#160;<br/>
committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our&#160;<br/>
society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as&#160;<br/>
unfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot&#160;<br/>
pity her: she is white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because&#160;<br/>
her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in&#160;<br/>
breaking it. She persisted, and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us&#160;<br/>
have known at one time or another. She did something every child has done—she&#160;<br/>
tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her. But in this case she was no&#160;<br/>
child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victim—of necessity she&#160;<br/>
must put him away from her—he must be removed from her presence, from this&#160;<br/>
world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense.<br/>
“What was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must&#160;<br/>
put Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what&#160;<br/>
she did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro.<br/>
“She was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that in our society is&#160;<br/>
unspeakable: she kissed a black man. Not an old Uncle, but a strong young Negro&#160;<br/>
man. No code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on&#160;<br/>
her afterwards.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=208></a>“Her father saw it, and the defendant has testified as to his remarks. What did her&#160;<br/>
father do? We don’t know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that&#160;<br/>
Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with&#160;<br/>
his left. We do know in part what Mr. Ewell did: he did what any God-fearing,&#160;<br/>
persevering, respectable white man would do under the circumstances—he swore&#160;<br/>
out a warrant, no doubt signing it with his left hand, and Tom Robinson now sits&#160;<br/>
before you, having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesses—his right&#160;<br/>
hand.<br/>
“And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to&#160;<br/>
‘feel sorry’ for a white woman has had to put his word against two white&#160;<br/>
people’s. I need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the stand—<br/>
you saw them for yourselves. The witnesses for the state, with the exception of&#160;<br/>
the sheriff of Maycomb County, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to&#160;<br/>
this court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted,&#160;<br/>
confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumption—the&#160;<br/>
evil assumption—that&#160;<i>all</i>&#160;Negroes lie, that&#160;<i>all</i>&#160;Negroes are basically immoral&#160;<br/>
beings, that&#160;<i>all</i>&#160;Negro men are not to be trusted around our women, an assumption&#160;<br/>
one associates with minds of their caliber.<br/>
“Which, gentlemen, we know is in itself a lie as black as Tom Robinson’s skin, a&#160;<br/>
lie I do not have to point out to you. You know the truth, and the truth is this:&#160;<br/>
some Negroes lie, some Negroes are immoral, some Negro men are not to be&#160;<br/>
trusted around women—black or white. But this is a truth that applies to the&#160;<br/>
human race and to no particular race of men. There is not a person in this&#160;<br/>
courtroom who has never told a lie, who has never done an immoral thing, and&#160;<br/>
there is no man living who has never looked upon a woman without desire.”<br/>
Atticus paused and took out his handkerchief. Then he took off his glasses and&#160;<br/>
wiped them, and we saw another “first”: we had never seen him sweat—he was&#160;<br/>
one of those men whose faces never perspired, but now it was shining tan.<br/>
“One more thing, gentlemen, before I quit. Thomas Jefferson once said that all&#160;<br/>
men are created equal, a phrase that the Yankees and the distaff side of the&#160;<br/>
Executive branch in Washington are fond of hurling at us. There is a tendency in&#160;<br/>
this year of grace, 1935, for certain people to use this phrase out of context, to&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=209></a>satisfy all conditions. The most ridiculous example I can think of is that the&#160;<br/>
people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the&#160;<br/>
industrious—because all men are created equal, educators will gravely tell you,&#160;<br/>
the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority. We know all men are&#160;<br/>
not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe—some people&#160;<br/>
are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they’re born&#160;<br/>
with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes&#160;<br/>
than others—some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men.<br/>
“But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal—there is&#160;<br/>
one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid&#160;<br/>
man the equal of an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college&#160;<br/>
president. That institution, gentlemen, is a court. It can be the Supreme Court of&#160;<br/>
the United States or the humblest J.P. court in the land, or this honorable court&#160;<br/>
which you serve. Our courts have their faults, as does any human institution, but&#160;<br/>
in this country our courts are the great levelers, and in our courts all men are&#160;<br/>
created equal.<br/>
“I’m no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury&#160;<br/>
system—that is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court&#160;<br/>
is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as&#160;<br/>
sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up. I am&#160;<br/>
confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have&#160;<br/>
heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family. In the name of&#160;<br/>
God, do your duty.”<br/>
Atticus’s voice had dropped, and as he turned away from the jury he said&#160;<br/>
something I did not catch. He said it more to himself than to the court. I punched&#160;<br/>
Jem. “What’d he say?”<br/>
“‘In the name of God, believe him,’ I think that’s what he said.”<br/>
Dill suddenly reached over me and tugged at Jem. “Looka yonder!”<br/>
We followed his finger with sinking hearts. Calpurnia was making her way up the&#160;<br/>
middle aisle, walking straight toward Atticus.<br/>

<b>Chapter 21</b><br/>
She stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get Judge Taylor’s attention. She&#160;<br/>
was in a fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her hand.<br/>
Judge Taylor saw her and said, “It’s Calpurnia, isn’t it?”<br/>
“Yes sir,” she said. “Could I just pass this note to Mr. Finch, please sir? It hasn’t&#160;<br/>
got anything to do with—with the trial.”<br/>
Judge Taylor nodded and Atticus took the envelope from Calpurnia. He opened it,&#160;<br/>
read its contents and said, “Judge, I—this note is from my sister. She says my&#160;<br/>
children are missing, haven’t turned up since noon… I… could you—”<br/>
“I know where they are, Atticus.” Mr. Underwood spoke up. “They’re right up&#160;<br/>
yonder in the colored balcony—been there since precisely one-eighteen P.M.”<br/>
Our father turned around and looked up. “Jem, come down from there,” he called.&#160;<br/>
Then he said something to the Judge we didn’t hear. We climbed across Reverend&#160;<br/>
Sykes and made our way to the staircase.<br/>
Atticus and Calpurnia met us downstairs. Calpurnia looked peeved, but Atticus&#160;<br/>
looked exhausted.<br/>
Jem was jumping in excitement. “We’ve won, haven’t we?”<br/>
“I’ve no idea,” said Atticus shortly. “You’ve been here all afternoon? Go home&#160;<br/>
with Calpurnia and get your supper—and stay home.”<br/>
“Aw, Atticus, let us come back,” pleaded Jem. “Please let us hear the verdict,&#160;<br/>
<i>please</i>&#160;sir.”<br/>
“The jury might be out and back in a minute, we don’t know—” but we could tell&#160;<br/>
Atticus was relenting. “Well, you’ve heard it all, so you might as well hear the&#160;<br/>
rest. Tell you what, you all can come back when you’ve eaten your supper—eat&#160;<br/>
slowly, now, you won’t miss anything important—and if the jury’s still out, you&#160;<br/>
can wait with us. But I expect it’ll be over before you get back.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=211></a>“You think they’ll acquit him that fast?” asked Jem.<br/>
Atticus opened his mouth to answer, but shut it and left us.<br/>
I prayed that Reverend Sykes would save our seats for us, but stopped praying&#160;<br/>
when I remembered that people got up and left in droves when the jury was out—<br/>
tonight, they’d overrun the drugstore, the O.K. Café and the hotel, that is, unless&#160;<br/>
they had brought their suppers too.<br/>
Calpurnia marched us home: “—skin every one of you alive, the very idea, you&#160;<br/>
children listenin‘ to all that! Mister Jem, don’t you know better’n to take your&#160;<br/>
little sister to that trial? Miss Alexandra’ll absolutely have a stroke of paralysis&#160;<br/>
when she finds out! Ain’t fittin’ for children to hear…”<br/>
The streetlights were on, and we glimpsed Calpurnia’s indignant profile as we&#160;<br/>
passed beneath them. “Mister Jem, I thought you was gettin‘ some kinda head on&#160;<br/>
your shoulders—the very idea, she’s your little sister! The very&#160;<i>idea</i>, sir! You&#160;<br/>
oughta be perfectly ashamed of yourself—ain’t you got any sense at all?”<br/>
I was exhilarated. So many things had happened so fast I felt it would take years&#160;<br/>
to sort them out, and now here was Calpurnia giving her precious Jem down the&#160;<br/>
country—what new marvels would the evening bring?<br/>
Jem was chuckling. “Don’t you want to hear about it, Cal?”<br/>
“Hush your mouth, sir! When you oughta be hangin‘ your head in shame you go&#160;<br/>
along laughin’—” Calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that moved Jem to&#160;<br/>
little remorse, and she sailed up the front steps with her classic, “If Mr. Finch&#160;<br/>
don’t wear you out, I will—get in that house, sir!”<br/>
Jem went in grinning, and Calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having Dill in to&#160;<br/>
supper. “You all call Miss Rachel right now and tell her where you are,” she told&#160;<br/>
him. “She’s run distracted lookin‘ for you—you watch out she don’t ship you&#160;<br/>
back to Meridian first thing in the mornin’.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra met us and nearly fainted when Calpurnia told her where we&#160;<br/>
were. I guess it hurt her when we told her Atticus said we could go back, because&#160;<br/>
she didn’t say a word during supper. She just rearranged food on her plate,&#160;<br/>
looking at it sadly while Calpurnia served Jem, Dill and me with a vengeance.&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia poured milk, dished out potato salad and ham, muttering, “‘shamed of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=212></a>yourselves,” in varying degrees of intensity. “Now you all eat slow,” was her final&#160;<br/>
command.<br/>
Reverend Sykes had saved our places. We were surprised to find that we had been&#160;<br/>
gone nearly an hour, and were equally surprised to find the courtroom exactly as&#160;<br/>
we had left it, with minor changes: the jury box was empty, the defendant was&#160;<br/>
gone; Judge Taylor had been gone, but he reappeared as we were seating&#160;<br/>
ourselves.<br/>
“Nobody’s moved, hardly,” said Jem.<br/>
“They moved around some when the jury went out,” said Reverend Sykes. “The&#160;<br/>
menfolk down there got the womenfolk their suppers, and they fed their babies.”<br/>
“How long have they been out?” asked Jem.<br/>
“‘bout thirty minutes. Mr. Finch and Mr. Gilmer did some more talkin’, and Judge&#160;<br/>
Taylor charged the jury.”<br/>
“How was he?” asked Jem.<br/>
“What say? Oh, he did right well. I ain’t complainin‘ one bit—he was mighty fair-<br/>
minded. He sorta said if you believe this, then you’ll have to return one verdict,&#160;<br/>
but if you believe this, you’ll have to return another one. I thought he was leanin’&#160;<br/>
a little to our side—” Reverend Sykes scratched his head.<br/>
Jem smiled. “He’s not supposed to lean, Reverend, but don’t fret, we’ve won it,”&#160;<br/>
he said wisely. “Don’t see how any jury could convict on what we heard—”<br/>
“Now don’t you be so confident, Mr. Jem, I ain’t ever seen any jury decide in&#160;<br/>
favor of a colored man over a white man…” But Jem took exception to Reverend&#160;<br/>
Sykes, and we were subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with Jem’s&#160;<br/>
ideas on the law regarding rape: it wasn’t rape if she let you, but she had to be&#160;<br/>
eighteen—in Alabama, that is—and Mayella was nineteen. Apparently you had to&#160;<br/>
kick and holler, you had to be overpowered and stomped on, preferably knocked&#160;<br/>
stone cold. If you were under eighteen, you didn’t have to go through all this.<br/>
“Mr. Jem,” Reverend Sykes demurred, “this ain’t a polite thing for little ladies to&#160;<br/>
hear…”<br/>
“Aw, she doesn’t know what we’re talkin‘ about,” said Jem. “Scout, this is too&#160;<br/>
old for you, ain’t it?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=213></a>“It most certainly is not, I know every word you’re saying.” Perhaps I was too&#160;<br/>
convincing, because Jem hushed and never discussed the subject again.<br/>
“What time is it, Reverend?” he asked.<br/>
“Gettin‘ on toward eight.”<br/>
I looked down and saw Atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets: he&#160;<br/>
made a tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over to the jury box. He&#160;<br/>
looked in it, inspected Judge Taylor on his throne, then went back to where he&#160;<br/>
started. I caught his eye and waved to him. He acknowledged my salute with a&#160;<br/>
nod, and resumed his tour.<br/>
Mr. Gilmer was standing at the windows talking to Mr. Underwood. Bert, the&#160;<br/>
court reporter, was chain-smoking: he sat back with his feet on the table.<br/>
But the officers of the court, the ones present—Atticus, Mr. Gilmer, Judge Taylor&#160;<br/>
sound asleep, and Bert, were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal. I had&#160;<br/>
never seen a packed courtroom so still. Sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully,&#160;<br/>
and a child would scurry out, but the grown people sat as if they were in church.&#160;<br/>
In the balcony, the Negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience.<br/>
The old courthouse clock suffered its preliminary strain and struck the hour, eight&#160;<br/>
deafening bongs that shook our bones.<br/>
When it bonged eleven times I was past feeling: tired from fighting sleep, I&#160;<br/>
allowed myself a short nap against Reverend Sykes’s comfortable arm and&#160;<br/>
shoulder. I jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so, by looking down&#160;<br/>
and concentrating on the heads below: there were sixteen bald ones, fourteen men&#160;<br/>
that could pass for redheads, forty heads varying between brown and black, and—<br/>
I remembered something Jem had once explained to me when he went through a&#160;<br/>
brief period of psychical research: he said if enough people—a stadium full,&#160;<br/>
maybe—were to concentrate on one thing, such as setting a tree afire in the&#160;<br/>
woods, that the tree would ignite of its own accord. I toyed with the idea of asking&#160;<br/>
everyone below to concentrate on setting Tom Robinson free, but thought if they&#160;<br/>
were as tired as I, it wouldn’t work.<br/>
Dill was sound asleep, his head on Jem’s shoulder, and Jem was quiet.<br/>
“Ain’t it a long time?” I asked him.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=214></a>“Sure is, Scout,” he said happily.<br/>
“Well, from the way you put it, it’d just take five minutes.”<br/>
Jem raised his eyebrows. “There are things you don’t understand,” he said, and I&#160;<br/>
was too weary to argue.<br/>
But I must have been reasonably awake, or I would not have received the&#160;<br/>
impression that was creeping into me. It was not unlike one I had last winter, and&#160;<br/>
I shivered, though the night was hot. The feeling grew until the atmosphere in the&#160;<br/>
courtroom was exactly the same as a cold February morning, when the&#160;<br/>
mockingbirds were still, and the carpenters had stopped hammering on Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie’s new house, and every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight&#160;<br/>
as the doors of the Radley Place. A deserted, waiting, empty street, and the&#160;<br/>
courtroom was packed with people. A steaming summer night was no different&#160;<br/>
from a winter morning. Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered the courtroom and was&#160;<br/>
talking to Atticus, might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket.&#160;<br/>
Atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung&#160;<br/>
of a chair; as he listened to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up&#160;<br/>
and down his thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute, “Take him, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Finch…”<br/>
But Mr. Tate said, “This court will come to order,” in a voice that rang with&#160;<br/>
authority, and the heads below us jerked up. Mr. Tate left the room and returned&#160;<br/>
with Tom Robinson. He steered Tom to his place beside Atticus, and stood there.&#160;<br/>
Judge Taylor had roused himself to sudden alertness and was sitting up straight,&#160;<br/>
looking at the empty jury box.<br/>
What happened after that had a dreamlike quality: in a dream I saw the jury&#160;<br/>
return, moving like underwater swimmers, and Judge Taylor’s voice came from&#160;<br/>
far away and was tiny. I saw something only a lawyer’s child could be expected&#160;<br/>
to see, could be expected to watch for, and it was like watching Atticus walk into&#160;<br/>
the street, raise a rifle to his shoulder and pull the trigger, but watching all the&#160;<br/>
time knowing that the gun was empty.<br/>
A jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted, and when this jury came in, not&#160;<br/>
one of them looked at Tom Robinson. The foreman handed a piece of paper to&#160;<br/>
Mr. Tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to the judge…<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=215></a>I shut my eyes. Judge Taylor was polling the jury: “Guilty… guilty… guilty…&#160;<br/>
guilty…” I peeked at Jem: his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail,&#160;<br/>
and his shoulders jerked as if each “guilty” was a separate stab between them.<br/>
Judge Taylor was saying something. His gavel was in his fist, but he wasn’t using&#160;<br/>
it. Dimly, I saw Atticus pushing papers from the table into his briefcase. He&#160;<br/>
snapped it shut, went to the court reporter and said something, nodded to Mr.&#160;<br/>
Gilmer, and then went to Tom Robinson and whispered something to him. Atticus&#160;<br/>
put his hand on Tom’s shoulder as he whispered. Atticus took his coat off the&#160;<br/>
back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder. Then he left the courtroom, but&#160;<br/>
not by his usual exit. He must have wanted to go home the short way, because he&#160;<br/>
walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit. I followed the top of&#160;<br/>
his head as he made his way to the door. He did not look up.<br/>
Someone was punching me, but I was reluctant to take my eyes from the people&#160;<br/>
below us, and from the image of Atticus’s lonely walk down the aisle.<br/>
“Miss Jean Louise?”<br/>
I looked around. They were standing. All around us and in the balcony on the&#160;<br/>
opposite wall, the Negroes were getting to their feet. Reverend Sykes’s voice was&#160;<br/>
as distant as Judge Taylor’s:<br/>
“Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father’s passin‘.”<br/>

<b>Chapter 22</b><br/>
It was Jem’s turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our&#160;<br/>
way through the cheerful crowd. “It ain’t right,” he muttered, all the way to the&#160;<br/>
corner of the square where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under&#160;<br/>
the street light looking as though nothing had happened: his vest was buttoned,&#160;<br/>
his collar and tie were neatly in place, his watch-chain glistened, he was his&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=216></a>impassive self again.<br/>
“It ain’t right, Atticus,” said Jem.<br/>
“No son, it’s not right.”<br/>
We walked home.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was waiting up. She was in her dressing gown, and I could have&#160;<br/>
sworn she had on her corset underneath it. “I’m sorry, brother,” she murmured.&#160;<br/>
Having never heard her call Atticus “brother” before, I stole a glance at Jem, but&#160;<br/>
he was not listening. He would look up at Atticus, then down at the floor, and I&#160;<br/>
wondered if he thought Atticus somehow responsible for Tom Robinson’s&#160;<br/>
conviction.<br/>
“Is he all right?” Aunty asked, indicating Jem.<br/>
“He’ll be so presently,” said Atticus. “It was a little too strong for him.” Our&#160;<br/>
father sighed. “I’m going to bed,” he said. “If I don’t wake up in the morning,&#160;<br/>
don’t call me.”<br/>
“I didn’t think it wise in the first place to let them—”<br/>
“This is their home, sister,” said Atticus. “We’ve made it this way for them, they&#160;<br/>
might as well learn to cope with it.”<br/>
“But they don’t have to go to the courthouse and wallow in it—”<br/>
“It’s just as much Maycomb County as missionary teas.”<br/>
“Atticus—” Aunt Alexandra’s eyes were anxious. “You are the last person I&#160;<br/>
thought would turn bitter over this.”<br/>
“I’m not bitter, just tired. I’m going to bed.”<br/>
“Atticus—” said Jem bleakly.<br/>
He turned in the doorway. “What, son?”<br/>
“How could they do it, how could they?”<br/>
“I don’t know, but they did it. They’ve done it before and they did it tonight and&#160;<br/>
they’ll do it again and when they do it—seems that only children weep. Good&#160;<br/>
night.”<br/>
But things are always better in the morning. Atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour&#160;<br/>
and was in the livingroom behind the&#160;<i>Mobile Register</i>&#160;when we stumbled in.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=217></a>Jem’s morning face posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask.<br/>
“It’s not time to worry yet,” Atticus reassured him, as we went to the diningroom.&#160;<br/>
“We’re not through yet. There’ll be an appeal, you can count on that. Gracious&#160;<br/>
alive, Cal, what’s all this?” He was staring at his breakfast plate.<br/>
Calpurnia said, “Tom Robinson’s daddy sent you along this chicken this morning.&#160;<br/>
I fixed it.”<br/>
“You tell him I’m proud to get it—bet they don’t have chicken for breakfast at the&#160;<br/>
White House. What are these?”<br/>
“Rolls,” said Calpurnia. “Estelle down at the hotel sent ‘em.”<br/>
Atticus looked up at her, puzzled, and she said, “You better step out here and see&#160;<br/>
what’s in the kitchen, Mr. Finch.”<br/>
We followed him. The kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the&#160;<br/>
family: hunks of salt pork, tomatoes, beans, even scuppernongs. Atticus grinned&#160;<br/>
when he found a jar of pickled pigs’ knuckles. “Reckon Aunty’ll let me eat these&#160;<br/>
in the diningroom?”<br/>
Calpurnia said, “This was all ‘round the back steps when I got here this morning.&#160;<br/>
They—they ’preciate what you did, Mr. Finch. They—they aren’t oversteppin‘&#160;<br/>
themselves, are they?”<br/>
Atticus’s eyes filled with tears. He did not speak for a moment. “Tell them I’m&#160;<br/>
very grateful,” he said. “Tell them—tell them they must never do this again.&#160;<br/>
Times are too hard…”<br/>
He left the kitchen, went in the diningroom and excused himself to Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra, put on his hat and went to town.<br/>
We heard Dill’s step in the hall, so Calpurnia left Atticus’s uneaten breakfast on&#160;<br/>
the table. Between rabbit-bites Dill told us of Miss Rachel’s reaction to last night,&#160;<br/>
which was: if a man like Atticus Finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall&#160;<br/>
it’s his head.<br/>
“I’da got her told,” growled Dill, gnawing a chicken leg, “but she didn’t look&#160;<br/>
much like tellin‘ this morning. Said she was up half the night wonderin’ where I&#160;<br/>
was, said she’da had the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing.”<br/>
“Dill, you’ve got to stop goin‘ off without tellin’ her,” said Jem. “It just&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=218></a>aggravates her.”<br/>
Dill sighed patiently. “I told her till I was blue in the face where I was goin‘—<br/>
she’s just seein’ too many snakes in the closet. Bet that woman drinks a pint for&#160;<br/>
breakfast every morning—know she drinks two glasses full. Seen her.”<br/>
“Don’t talk like that, Dill,” said Aunt Alexandra. “It’s not becoming to a child. It’s<br/>
—cynical.”<br/>
“I ain’t cynical, Miss Alexandra. Tellin‘ the truth’s not cynical, is it?”<br/>
“The way you tell it, it is.”<br/>
Jem’s eyes flashed at her, but he said to Dill, “Let’s go. You can take that runner&#160;<br/>
with you.”<br/>
When we went to the front porch, Miss Stephanie Crawford was busy telling it to&#160;<br/>
Miss Maudie Atkinson and Mr. Avery. They looked around at us and went on&#160;<br/>
talking. Jem made a feral noise in his throat. I wished for a weapon.<br/>
“I hate grown folks lookin‘ at you,” said Dill. “Makes you feel like you’ve done&#160;<br/>
something.”<br/>
Miss Maudie yelled for Jem Finch to come there.<br/>
Jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing. “We’ll go with you,” Dill&#160;<br/>
said.<br/>
Miss Stephanie’s nose quivered with curiosity. She wanted to know who all gave&#160;<br/>
us permission to go to court—she didn’t see us but it was all over town this&#160;<br/>
morning that we were in the Colored balcony. Did Atticus put us up there as a sort&#160;<br/>
of—? Wasn’t it right close up there with all those—? Did Scout understand all the<br/>
—? Didn’t it make us mad to see our daddy beat?<br/>
“Hush, Stephanie.” Miss Maudie’s diction was deadly. “I’ve not got all the&#160;<br/>
morning to pass on the porch—Jem Finch, I called to find out if you and your&#160;<br/>
colleagues can eat some cake. Got up at five to make it, so you better say yes.&#160;<br/>
Excuse us, Stephanie. Good morning, Mr. Avery.”<br/>
There was a big cake and two little ones on Miss Maudie’s kitchen table. There&#160;<br/>
should have been three little ones. It was not like Miss Maudie to forget Dill, and&#160;<br/>
we must have shown it. But we understood when she cut from the big cake and&#160;<br/>
gave the slice to Jem.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=219></a>As we ate, we sensed that this was Miss Maudie’s way of saying that as far as she&#160;<br/>
was concerned, nothing had changed. She sat quietly in a kitchen chair, watching&#160;<br/>
us.<br/>
Suddenly she spoke: “Don’t fret, Jem. Things are never as bad as they seem.”<br/>
Indoors, when Miss Maudie wanted to say something lengthy she spread her&#160;<br/>
fingers on her knees and settled her bridgework. This she did, and we waited.<br/>
“I simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to&#160;<br/>
do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your father’s one of them.”<br/>
“Oh,” said Jem. “Well.”<br/>
“Don’t you oh well me, sir,” Miss Maudie replied, recognizing Jem’s fatalistic&#160;<br/>
noises, “you are not old enough to appreciate what I said.”<br/>
Jem was staring at his half-eaten cake. “It’s like bein‘ a caterpillar in a cocoon,&#160;<br/>
that’s what it is,” he said. “Like somethin’ asleep wrapped up in a warm place. I&#160;<br/>
always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that’s what&#160;<br/>
they seemed like.”<br/>
“We’re the safest folks in the world,” said Miss Maudie. “We’re so rarely called&#160;<br/>
on to be Christians, but when we are, we’ve got men like Atticus to go for us.”<br/>
Jem grinned ruefully. “Wish the rest of the county thought that.”<br/>
“You’d be surprised how many of us do.”<br/>
“Who?” Jem’s voice rose. “Who in this town did one thing to help Tom&#160;<br/>
Robinson, just who?”<br/>
“His colored friends for one thing, and people like us. People like Judge Taylor.&#160;<br/>
People like Mr. Heck Tate. Stop eating and start thinking, Jem. Did it ever strike&#160;<br/>
you that Judge Taylor naming Atticus to defend that boy was no accident? That&#160;<br/>
Judge Taylor might have had his reasons for naming him?”<br/>
This was a thought. Court-appointed defenses were usually given to Maxwell&#160;<br/>
Green, Maycomb’s latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience.&#160;<br/>
Maxwell Green should have had Tom Robinson’s case.<br/>
“You think about that,” Miss Maudie was saying. “It was no accident. I was sittin‘&#160;<br/>
there on the porch last night, waiting. I waited and waited to see you all come&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=220></a>down the sidewalk, and as I waited I thought, Atticus Finch won’t win, he can’t&#160;<br/>
win, but he’s the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case&#160;<br/>
like that. And I thought to myself, well, we’re making a step—it’s just a baby-<br/>
step, but it’s a step.”<br/>
“‘t’s all right to talk like that—can’t any Christian judges an’ lawyers make up for&#160;<br/>
heathen juries,” Jem muttered. “Soon’s I get grown—”<br/>
“That’s something you’ll have to take up with your father,” Miss Maudie said.<br/>
We went down Miss Maudie’s cool new steps into the sunshine and found Mr.&#160;<br/>
Avery and Miss Stephanie Crawford still at it. They had moved down the&#160;<br/>
sidewalk and were standing in front of Miss Stephanie’s house. Miss Rachel was&#160;<br/>
walking toward them.<br/>
“I think I’ll be a clown when I get grown,” said Dill.<br/>
Jem and I stopped in our tracks.<br/>
“Yes sir, a clown,” he said. “There ain’t one thing in this world I can do about&#160;<br/>
folks except laugh, so I’m gonna join the circus and laugh my head off.”<br/>
“You got it backwards, Dill,” said Jem. “Clowns are sad, it’s folks that laugh at&#160;<br/>
them.”<br/>
“Well I’m gonna be a new kind of clown. I’m gonna stand in the middle of the&#160;<br/>
ring and laugh at the folks. Just looka yonder,” he pointed. “Every one of ‘em&#160;<br/>
oughta be ridin’ broomsticks. Aunt Rachel already does.”<br/>
Miss Stephanie and Miss Rachel were waving wildly at us, in a way that did not&#160;<br/>
give the lie to Dill’s observation.<br/>
“Oh gosh,” breathed Jem. “I reckon it’d be ugly not to see ‘em.”<br/>
Something was wrong. Mr. Avery was red in the face from a sneezing spell and&#160;<br/>
nearly blew us off the sidewalk when we came up. Miss Stephanie was trembling&#160;<br/>
with excitement, and Miss Rachel caught Dill’s shoulder. “You get on in the back&#160;<br/>
yard and stay there,” she said. “There’s danger a’comin‘.”<br/>
“‘s matter?” I asked.<br/>
“Ain’t you heard yet? It’s all over town—”<br/>
At that moment Aunt Alexandra came to the door and called us, but she was too&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=221></a>late. It was Miss Stephanie’s pleasure to tell us: this morning Mr. Bob Ewell&#160;<br/>
stopped Atticus on the post office corner, spat in his face, and told him he’d get&#160;<br/>
him if it took the rest of his life.<br/>
<a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#1">Contents&#160;-&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#215">Prev&#160;/&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#231">Next</a><br/>
<b>Chapter 23</b><br/>
“I wish Bob Ewell wouldn’t chew tobacco,” was all Atticus said about it.<br/>
According to Miss Stephanie Crawford, however, Atticus was leaving the post&#160;<br/>
office when Mr. Ewell approached him, cursed him, spat on him, and threatened&#160;<br/>
to kill him. Miss Stephanie (who, by the time she had told it twice was there and&#160;<br/>
had seen it all—passing by from the Jitney Jungle, she was)—Miss Stephanie said&#160;<br/>
Atticus didn’t bat an eye, just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and&#160;<br/>
stood there and let Mr. Ewell call him names wild horses could not bring her to&#160;<br/>
repeat. Mr. Ewell was a veteran of an obscure war; that plus Atticus’s peaceful&#160;<br/>
reaction probably prompted him to inquire, “Too proud to fight, you nigger-lovin‘&#160;<br/>
bastard?” Miss Stephanie said Atticus said, “No, too old,” put his hands in his&#160;<br/>
pockets and strolled on. Miss Stephanie said you had to hand it to Atticus Finch,&#160;<br/>
he could be right dry sometimes.<br/>
Jem and I didn’t think it entertaining.<br/>
“After all, though,” I said, “he was the deadest shot in the county one time. He&#160;<br/>
could—”<br/>
“You know he wouldn’t carry a gun, Scout. He ain’t even got one—” said Jem.&#160;<br/>
“You know he didn’t even have one down at the jail that night. He told me havin‘&#160;<br/>
a gun around’s an invitation to somebody to shoot you.”<br/>
“This is different,” I said. “We can ask him to borrow one.”<br/>
We did, and he said, “Nonsense.”<br/>
Dill was of the opinion that an appeal to Atticus’s better nature might work: after&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=222></a>all, we would starve if Mr. Ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by&#160;<br/>
Aunt Alexandra, and we all knew the first thing she’d do before Atticus was&#160;<br/>
under the ground good would be to fire Calpurnia. Jem said it might work if I&#160;<br/>
cried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didn’t work either. But when he&#160;<br/>
noticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in&#160;<br/>
our normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. He&#160;<br/>
tempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw Jem flip the&#160;<br/>
pages and toss it aside, he said, “What’s bothering you, son?”<br/>
Jem came to the point: “Mr. Ewell.”<br/>
“What has happened?”<br/>
“Nothing’s happened. We’re scared for you, and we think you oughta do&#160;<br/>
something about him.”<br/>
Atticus smiled wryly. “Do what? Put him under a peace bond?”<br/>
“When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.”<br/>
“He meant it when he said it,” said Atticus. “Jem, see if you can stand in Bob&#160;<br/>
Ewell’s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he&#160;<br/>
had any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind&#160;<br/>
always does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell&#160;<br/>
one extra beating, that’s something I’ll gladly take. He had to take it out on&#160;<br/>
somebody and I’d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. You&#160;<br/>
understand?”<br/>
Jem nodded.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, “We don’t have anything&#160;<br/>
to fear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.”<br/>
“I wouldn’t be so sure of that, Atticus,” she said. “His kind’d do anything to pay&#160;<br/>
off a grudge. You know how those people are.”<br/>
“What on earth could Ewell do to me, sister?”<br/>
“Something furtive,” Aunt Alexandra said. “You may count on that.”<br/>
“Nobody has much chance to be furtive in Maycomb,” Atticus answered.<br/>
After that, we were not afraid. Summer was melting away, and we made the most&#160;<br/>
of it. Atticus assured us that nothing would happen to Tom Robinson until the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=223></a>higher court reviewed his case, and that Tom had a good chance of going free, or&#160;<br/>
at least of having a new trial. He was at Enfield Prison Farm, seventy miles away&#160;<br/>
in Chester County. I asked Atticus if Tom’s wife and children were allowed to&#160;<br/>
visit him, but Atticus said no.<br/>
“If he loses his appeal,” I asked one evening, “what’ll happen to him?”<br/>
“He’ll go to the chair,” said Atticus, “unless the Governor commutes his sentence.&#160;<br/>
Not time to worry yet, Scout. We’ve got a good chance.”<br/>
Jem was sprawled on the sofa reading&#160;<i>Popular Mechanics</i>. He looked up. “It ain’t&#160;<br/>
right. He didn’t kill anybody even if he was guilty. He didn’t take anybody’s life.”<br/>
“You know rape’s a capital offense in Alabama,” said Atticus.<br/>
“Yessir, but the jury didn’t have to give him death—if they wanted to they&#160;<br/>
could’ve gave him twenty years.”<br/>
“Given,” said Atticus. “Tom Robinson’s a colored man, Jem. No jury in this part&#160;<br/>
of the world’s going to say, ‘We think you’re guilty, but not very,’ on a charge&#160;<br/>
like that. It was either a straight acquittal or nothing.”<br/>
Jem was shaking his head. “I know it’s not right, but I can’t figure out what’s&#160;<br/>
wrong—maybe rape shouldn’t be a capital offense…”<br/>
Atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair. He said he didn’t have any&#160;<br/>
quarrel with the rape statute, none what ever, but he did have deep misgivings&#160;<br/>
when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely&#160;<br/>
circumstantial evidence. He glanced at me, saw I was listening, and made it&#160;<br/>
easier. “—I mean, before a man is sentenced to death for murder, say, there&#160;<br/>
should be one or two eye-witnesses. Some one should be able to say, ‘Yes, I was&#160;<br/>
there and saw him pull the trigger.’”<br/>
“But lots of folks have been hung—hanged—on circumstantial evidence,” said&#160;<br/>
Jem.<br/>
“I know, and lots of ‘em probably deserved it, too—but in the absence of eye-<br/>
witnesses there’s always a doubt, some times only the shadow of a doubt. The law&#160;<br/>
says ’reasonable doubt,‘ but I think a defendant’s entitled to the shadow of a&#160;<br/>
doubt. There’s always the possibility, no matter how improbable, that he’s&#160;<br/>
innocent.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=224></a>“Then it all goes back to the jury, then. We oughta do away with juries.” Jem was&#160;<br/>
adamant.<br/>
Atticus tried hard not to smile but couldn’t help it. “You’re rather hard on us, son.&#160;<br/>
I think maybe there might be a better way. Change the law. Change it so that only&#160;<br/>
judges have the power of fixing the penalty in capital cases.”<br/>
“Then go up to Montgomery and change the law.”<br/>
“You’d be surprised how hard that’d be. I won’t live to see the law changed, and&#160;<br/>
if you live to see it you’ll be an old man.”<br/>
This was not good enough for Jem. “No sir, they oughta do away with juries. He&#160;<br/>
wasn’t guilty in the first place and they said he was.”<br/>
“If you had been on that jury, son, and eleven other boys like you, Tom would be&#160;<br/>
a free man,” said Atticus. “So far nothing in your life has interfered with your&#160;<br/>
reasoning process. Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom’s jury,&#160;<br/>
but you saw something come between them and reason. You saw the same thing&#160;<br/>
that night in front of the jail. When that crew went away, they didn’t go as&#160;<br/>
reasonable men, they went because we were there. There’s something in our&#160;<br/>
world that makes men lose their heads—they couldn’t be fair if they tried. In our&#160;<br/>
courts, when it’s a white man’s word against a black man’s, the white man always&#160;<br/>
wins. They’re ugly, but those are the facts of life.”<br/>
“Doesn’t make it right,” said Jem stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee.&#160;<br/>
“You just can’t convict a man on evidence like that—you can’t.”<br/>
“You couldn’t, but they could and did. The older you grow the more of it you’ll&#160;<br/>
see. The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he&#160;<br/>
any color of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments&#160;<br/>
right into a jury box. As you grow older, you’ll see white men cheat black men&#160;<br/>
every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don’t you forget it—<br/>
whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he&#160;<br/>
is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash.”<br/>
Atticus was speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ears. I looked up,&#160;<br/>
and his face was vehement. “There’s nothing more sickening to me than a low-<br/>
grade white man who’ll take advantage of a Negro’s ignorance. Don’t fool&#160;<br/>
yourselves—it’s all adding up and one of these days we’re going to pay the bill&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=225></a>for it. I hope it’s not in you children’s time.”<br/>
Jem was scratching his head. Suddenly his eyes widened. “Atticus,” he said, “why&#160;<br/>
don’t people like us and Miss Maudie ever sit on juries? You never see anybody&#160;<br/>
from Maycomb on a jury—they all come from out in the woods.”<br/>
Atticus leaned back in his rocking-chair. For some reason he looked pleased with&#160;<br/>
Jem. “I was wondering when that’d occur to you,” he said. “There are lots of&#160;<br/>
reasons. For one thing, Miss Maudie can’t serve on a jury because she’s a woman<br/>
—”<br/>
“You mean women in Alabama can’t—?” I was indignant.<br/>
“I do. I guess it’s to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Tom’s.&#160;<br/>
Besides,” Atticus grinned, “I doubt if we’d ever get a complete case tried—the&#160;<br/>
ladies’d be interrupting to ask questions.”<br/>
Jem and I laughed. Miss Maudie on a jury would be impressive. I thought of old&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Dubose in her wheelchair—“Stop that rapping, John Taylor, I want to ask&#160;<br/>
this man something.” Perhaps our forefathers were wise.<br/>
Atticus was saying, “With people like us—that’s our share of the bill. We&#160;<br/>
generally get the juries we deserve. Our stout Maycomb citizens aren’t interested,&#160;<br/>
in the first place. In the second place, they’re afraid. Then, they’re—”<br/>
“Afraid, why?” asked Jem.<br/>
“Well, what if—say, Mr. Link Deas had to decide the amount of damages to&#160;<br/>
award, say, Miss Maudie, when Miss Rachel ran over her with a car. Link&#160;<br/>
wouldn’t like the thought of losing either lady’s business at his store, would he?&#160;<br/>
So he tells Judge Taylor that he can’t serve on the jury because he doesn’t have&#160;<br/>
anybody to keep store for him while he’s gone. So Judge Taylor excuses him.&#160;<br/>
Sometimes he excuses him wrathfully.”<br/>
“What’d make him think either one of ‘em’d stop trading with him?” I asked.<br/>
Jem said, “Miss Rachel would, Miss Maudie wouldn’t. But a jury’s vote’s secret,&#160;<br/>
Atticus.”<br/>
Our father chuckled. “You’ve many more miles to go, son. A jury’s vote’s&#160;<br/>
supposed to be secret. Serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and&#160;<br/>
declare himself about something. Men don’t like to do that. Sometimes it’s&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=226></a>unpleasant.”<br/>
“Tom’s jury sho‘ made up its mind in a hurry,” Jem muttered.<br/>
Atticus’s fingers went to his watchpocket. “No it didn’t,” he said, more to himself&#160;<br/>
than to us. “That was the one thing that made me think, well, this may be the&#160;<br/>
shadow of a beginning. That jury took a few hours. An inevitable verdict, maybe,&#160;<br/>
but usually it takes ‘em just a few minutes. This time—” he broke off and looked&#160;<br/>
at us. “You might like to know that there was one fellow who took considerable&#160;<br/>
wearing down—in the beginning he was rarin’ for an outright acquittal.”<br/>
“Who?” Jem was astonished.<br/>
Atticus’s eyes twinkled. “It’s not for me to say, but I’ll tell you this much. He was&#160;<br/>
one of your Old Sarum friends…”<br/>
“One of the Cunninghams?” Jem yelped. “One of—I didn’t recognize any of&#160;<br/>
‘em… you’re jokin’.” He looked at Atticus from the corners of his eyes.<br/>
“One of their connections. On a hunch, I didn’t strike him. Just on a hunch.&#160;<br/>
Could’ve, but I didn’t.”<br/>
“Golly Moses,” Jem said reverently. “One minute they’re tryin‘ to kill him and&#160;<br/>
the next they’re tryin’ to turn him loose… I’ll never understand those folks as&#160;<br/>
long as I live.”<br/>
Atticus said you just had to know ‘em. He said the Cunninghams hadn’t taken&#160;<br/>
anything from or off of anybody since they migrated to the New World. He said&#160;<br/>
the other thing about them was, once you earned their respect they were for you&#160;<br/>
tooth and nail. Atticus said he had a feeling, nothing more than a suspicion, that&#160;<br/>
they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the Finches. Then too, he&#160;<br/>
said, it took a thunderbolt plus another Cunningham to make one of them change&#160;<br/>
his mind. “If we’d had two of that crowd, we’d’ve had a hung jury.”<br/>
Jem said slowly, “You mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to&#160;<br/>
kill you the night before? How could you take such a risk, Atticus, how could&#160;<br/>
you?”<br/>
“When you analyze it, there was little risk. There’s no difference between one&#160;<br/>
man who’s going to convict and another man who’s going to convict, is there?&#160;<br/>
There’s a faint difference between a man who’s going to convict and a man who’s&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=227></a>a little disturbed in his mind, isn’t there? He was the only uncertainty on the&#160;<br/>
whole list.”<br/>
“What kin was that man to Mr. Walter Cunningham?” I asked.<br/>
Atticus rose, stretched and yawned. It was not even our bedtime, but we knew he&#160;<br/>
wanted a chance to read his newspaper. He picked it up, folded it, and tapped my&#160;<br/>
head. “Let’s see now,” he droned to himself. “I’ve got it. Double first cousin.”<br/>
“How can that be?”<br/>
“Two sisters married two brothers. That’s all I’ll tell you—you figure it out.”<br/>
I tortured myself and decided that if I married Jem and Dill had a sister whom he&#160;<br/>
married our children would be double first cousins. “Gee minetti, Jem,” I said,&#160;<br/>
when Atticus had gone, “they’re funny folks. ‘d you hear that, Aunty?”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us, but she was listening.&#160;<br/>
She sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it, her rug spread across her lap.&#160;<br/>
Why ladies hooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me.<br/>
“I heard it,” she said.<br/>
I remembered the distant disastrous occasion when I rushed to young Walter&#160;<br/>
Cunningham’s defense. Now I was glad I’d done it. “Soon’s school starts I’m&#160;<br/>
gonna ask Walter home to dinner,” I planned, having forgotten my private resolve&#160;<br/>
to beat him up the next time I saw him. “He can stay over sometimes after school,&#160;<br/>
too. Atticus could drive him back to Old Sarum. Maybe he could spend the night&#160;<br/>
with us sometime, okay, Jem?”<br/>
“We’ll see about that,” Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was&#160;<br/>
always a threat, never a promise. Surprised, I turned to her. “Why not, Aunty?&#160;<br/>
They’re good folks.”<br/>
She looked at me over her sewing glasses. “Jean Louise, there is no doubt in my&#160;<br/>
mind that they’re good folks. But they’re not our kind of folks.”<br/>
Jem says, “She means they’re yappy, Scout.”<br/>
“What’s a yap?”<br/>
“Aw, tacky. They like fiddlin‘ and things like that.”<br/>
“Well I do too—”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=228></a>“Don’t be silly, Jean Louise,” said Aunt Alexandra. “The thing is, you can scrub&#160;<br/>
Walter Cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but&#160;<br/>
he’ll never be like Jem. Besides, there’s a drinking streak in that family a mile&#160;<br/>
wide. Finch women aren’t interested in that sort of people.”<br/>
“Aun-ty,” said Jem, “she ain’t nine yet.”<br/>
“She may as well learn it now.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put&#160;<br/>
her foot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia’s house—I was curious, interested; I wanted to be her “company,” to&#160;<br/>
see how she lived, who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the&#160;<br/>
other side of the moon. This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandra’s&#160;<br/>
aim was the same. Perhaps this was why she had come to live with us—to help us&#160;<br/>
choose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: “If they’re good folks,&#160;<br/>
then why can’t I be nice to Walter?”<br/>
“I didn’t say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you&#160;<br/>
should be gracious to everybody, dear. But you don’t have to invite him home.”<br/>
“What if he was kin to us, Aunty?”<br/>
“The fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same.”<br/>
“Aunty,” Jem spoke up, “Atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho‘&#160;<br/>
can’t choose your family, an’ they’re still kin to you no matter whether you&#160;<br/>
acknowledge ‘em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you don’t.”<br/>
“That’s your father all over again,” said Aunt Alexandra, “and I still say that Jean&#160;<br/>
Louise will not invite Walter Cunningham to this house. If he were her double&#160;<br/>
first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he&#160;<br/>
comes to see Atticus on business. Now that is that.”<br/>
She had said Indeed Not, but this time she would give her reasons: “But I want to&#160;<br/>
play with Walter, Aunty, why can’t I?”<br/>
She took off her glasses and stared at me. “I’ll tell you why,” she said. “Because—<br/>
he—is—trash, that’s why you can’t play with him. I’ll not have you around him,&#160;<br/>
picking up his habits and learning Lord-knows-what. You’re enough of a problem&#160;<br/>
to your father as it is.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=229></a>I don’t know what I would have done, but Jem stopped me. He caught me by the&#160;<br/>
shoulders, put his arm around me, and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom.&#160;<br/>
Atticus heard us and poked his head around the door. “‘s all right, sir,” Jem said&#160;<br/>
gruffly, “’s not anything.” Atticus went away.<br/>
“Have a chew, Scout.” Jem dug into his pocket and extracted a Tootsie Roll. It&#160;<br/>
took a few minutes to work the candy into a comfortable wad inside my jaw.<br/>
Jem was rearranging the objects on his dresser. His hair stuck up behind and&#160;<br/>
down in front, and I wondered if it would ever look like a man’s—maybe if he&#160;<br/>
shaved it off and started over, his hair would grow back neatly in place. His&#160;<br/>
eyebrows were becoming heavier, and I noticed a new slimness about his body.&#160;<br/>
He was growing taller. When he looked around, he must have thought I would&#160;<br/>
start crying again, for he said, “Show you something if you won’t tell anybody.” I&#160;<br/>
said what. He unbuttoned his shirt, grinning shyly.<br/>
“Well what?”<br/>
“Well can’t you see it?”<br/>
“Well no.”<br/>
“Well it’s hair.”<br/>
“Where?”<br/>
“There. Right there.”<br/>
He had been a comfort to me, so I said it looked lovely, but I didn’t see anything.&#160;<br/>
“It’s real nice, Jem.”<br/>
“Under my arms, too,” he said. “Goin‘ out for football next year. Scout, don’t let&#160;<br/>
Aunty aggravate you.”<br/>
It seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate Aunty.<br/>
“You know she’s not used to girls,” said Jem, “leastways, not girls like you. She’s&#160;<br/>
trying to make you a lady. Can’t you take up sewin‘ or somethin’?”<br/>
“Hell no. She doesn’t like me, that’s all there is to it, and I don’t care. It was her&#160;<br/>
callin‘ Walter Cunningham trash that got me goin’, Jem, not what she said about&#160;<br/>
being a problem to Atticus. We got that all straight one time, I asked him if I was&#160;<br/>
a problem and he said not much of one, at most one that he could always figure&#160;<br/>
out, and not to worry my head a second about botherin‘ him. Naw, it was Walter—<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=230></a>that boy’s not trash, Jem. He ain’t like the Ewells.”<br/>
Jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed. He propped himself&#160;<br/>
against a pillow and switched on the reading light. “You know something, Scout?&#160;<br/>
I’ve got it all figured out, now. I’ve thought about it a lot lately and I’ve got it&#160;<br/>
figured out. There’s four kinds of folks in the world. There’s the ordinary kind&#160;<br/>
like us and the neighbors, there’s the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods,&#160;<br/>
the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.”<br/>
“What about the Chinese, and the Cajuns down yonder in Baldwin County?”<br/>
“I mean in Maycomb County. The thing about it is, our kind of folks don’t like&#160;<br/>
the Cunninghams, the Cunninghams don’t like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate&#160;<br/>
and despise the colored folks.”<br/>
I told Jem if that was so, then why didn’t Tom’s jury, made up of folks like the&#160;<br/>
Cunninghams, acquit Tom to spite the Ewells?“<br/>
Jem waved my question away as being infantile.<br/>
“You know,” he said, “I’ve seen Atticus pat his foot when there’s fiddlin‘ on the&#160;<br/>
radio, and he loves pot liquor better’n any man I ever saw—”<br/>
“Then that makes us like the Cunninghams,” I said. “I can’t see why Aunty—”<br/>
“No, lemme finish—it does, but we’re still different somehow. Atticus said one&#160;<br/>
time the reason Aunty’s so hipped on the family is because all we’ve got’s&#160;<br/>
background and not a dime to our names.”<br/>
“Well Jem, I don’t know—Atticus told me one time that most of this Old Family&#160;<br/>
stuff’s foolishness because everybody’s family’s just as old as everybody else’s. I&#160;<br/>
said did that include the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes.”<br/>
“Background doesn’t mean Old Family,” said Jem. “I think it’s how long your&#160;<br/>
family’s been readin‘ and writin’. Scout, I’ve studied this real hard and that’s the&#160;<br/>
only reason I can think of. Somewhere along when the Finches were in Egypt one&#160;<br/>
of ‘em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy.” Jem&#160;<br/>
laughed. “Imagine Aunty being proud her great-grandaddy could read an’ write—<br/>
ladies pick funny things to be proud of.”<br/>
“Well I’m glad he could, or who’da taught Atticus and them, and if Atticus&#160;<br/>
couldn’t read, you and me’d be in a fix. I don’t think that’s what background is,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=231></a>Jem.”<br/>
“Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter&#160;<br/>
can hardly sign his name, I’ve seen him. We’ve just been readin‘ and writin’&#160;<br/>
longer’n they have.”<br/>
“No, everybody’s gotta learn, nobody’s born knowin‘. That Walter’s as smart as&#160;<br/>
he can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help&#160;<br/>
his daddy. Nothin’s wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there’s just one kind of&#160;<br/>
folks. Folks.”<br/>
Jem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was&#160;<br/>
cloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came&#160;<br/>
together; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.<br/>
“That’s what I thought, too,” he said at last, “when I was your age. If there’s just&#160;<br/>
one kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike,&#160;<br/>
why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I’m&#160;<br/>
beginning to understand something. I think I’m beginning to understand why Boo&#160;<br/>
Radley’s stayed shut up in the house all this time… it’s because he&#160;<i>wants</i>&#160;to stay&#160;<br/>
inside.”<br/>

<b>Chapter 24</b><br/>
Calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron. She carried a tray of charlotte. She&#160;<br/>
backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently. I admired the ease and grace&#160;<br/>
with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things. So did Aunt Alexandra, I&#160;<br/>
guess, because she had let Calpurnia serve today.<br/>
August was on the brink of September. Dill would be leaving for Meridian&#160;<br/>
tomorrow; today he was off with Jem at Barker’s Eddy. Jem had discovered with&#160;<br/>
angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach Dill how to swim, a&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=232></a>skill Jem considered necessary as walking. They had spent two afternoons at the&#160;<br/>
creek, they said they were going in naked and I couldn’t come, so I divided the&#160;<br/>
lonely hours between Calpurnia and Miss Maudie.<br/>
Today Aunt Alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all&#160;<br/>
over the house. From the kitchen, I heard Mrs. Grace Merriweather giving a&#160;<br/>
report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the Mrunas, it sounded like to me.&#160;<br/>
They put the women out in huts when their time came, whatever that was; they&#160;<br/>
had no sense of family—I knew that’d distress Aunty—they subjected children to&#160;<br/>
terrible ordeals when they were thirteen; they were crawling with yaws and&#160;<br/>
earworms, they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot&#160;<br/>
and then got drunk on it.<br/>
Immediately thereafter, the ladies adjourned for refreshments.<br/>
I didn’t know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out. Aunt Alexandra told&#160;<br/>
me to join them for refreshments; it was not necessary that I attend the business&#160;<br/>
part of the meeting, she said it’d bore me. I was wearing my pink Sunday dress,&#160;<br/>
shoes, and a petticoat, and reflected that if I spilled anything Calpurnia would&#160;<br/>
have to wash my dress again for tomorrow. This had been a busy day for her. I&#160;<br/>
decided to stay out.<br/>
“Can I help you, Cal?” I asked, wishing to be of some service.<br/>
Calpurnia paused in the doorway. “You be still as a mouse in that corner,” she&#160;<br/>
said, “an‘ you can help me load up the trays when I come back.”<br/>
The gentle hum of ladies’ voices grew louder as she opened the door: “Why,&#160;<br/>
Alexandra, I never saw such charlotte… just lovely… I never can get my crust&#160;<br/>
like this, never can… who’d‘ve thought of little dewberry tarts… Calpurnia?…&#160;<br/>
who’da thought it… anybody tell you that the preacher’s wife’s… nooo, well she&#160;<br/>
is, and that other one not walkin’ yet…”<br/>
They became quiet, and I knew they had all been served. Calpurnia returned and&#160;<br/>
put my mother’s heavy silver pitcher on a tray. “This coffee pitcher’s a curiosity,”&#160;<br/>
she murmured, “they don’t make ‘em these days.”<br/>
“Can I carry it in?”<br/>
“If you be careful and don’t drop it. Set it down at the end of the table by Miss&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=233></a>Alexandra. Down there by the cups’n things. She’s gonna pour.”<br/>
I tried pressing my behind against the door as Calpurnia had done, but the door&#160;<br/>
didn’t budge. Grinning, she held it open for me. “Careful now, it’s heavy. Don’t&#160;<br/>
look at it and you won’t spill it.”<br/>
My journey was successful: Aunt Alexandra smiled brilliantly. “Stay with us,&#160;<br/>
Jean Louise,” she said. This was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady.<br/>
It was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for&#160;<br/>
refreshments, be they Baptists or Presbyterians, which accounted for the presence&#160;<br/>
of Miss Rachel (sober as a judge), Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford.&#160;<br/>
Rather nervous, I took a seat beside Miss Maudie and wondered why ladies put on&#160;<br/>
their hats to go across the street. Ladies in bunches always filled me with vague&#160;<br/>
apprehension and a firm desire to be elsewhere, but this feeling was what Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra called being “spoiled.”<br/>
The ladies were cool in fragile pastel prints: most of them were heavily powdered&#160;<br/>
but unrouged; the only lipstick in the room was Tangee Natural. Cutex Natural&#160;<br/>
sparkled on their fingernails, but some of the younger ladies wore Rose. They&#160;<br/>
smelled heavenly. I sat quietly, having conquered my hands by tightly gripping&#160;<br/>
the arms of the chair, and waited for someone to speak to me.<br/>
Miss Maudie’s gold bridgework twinkled. “You’re mighty dressed up, Miss Jean&#160;<br/>
Louise,” she said, “Where are your britches today?”<br/>
“Under my dress.”<br/>
I hadn’t meant to be funny, but the ladies laughed. My cheeks grew hot as I&#160;<br/>
realized my mistake, but Miss Maudie looked gravely down at me. She never&#160;<br/>
laughed at me unless I meant to be funny.<br/>
In the sudden silence that followed, Miss Stephanie Crawford called from across&#160;<br/>
the room, “Whatcha going to be when you grow up, Jean Louise? A lawyer?”<br/>
“Nome, I hadn’t thought about it…” I answered, grateful that Miss Stephanie was&#160;<br/>
kind enough to change the subject. Hurriedly I began choosing my vocation.&#160;<br/>
Nurse? Aviator? “Well…”<br/>
“Why shoot, I thought you wanted to be a lawyer, you’ve already commenced&#160;<br/>
going to court.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=234></a>The ladies laughed again. “That Stephanie’s a card,” somebody said. Miss&#160;<br/>
Stephanie was encouraged to pursue the subject: “Don’t you want to grow up to&#160;<br/>
be a lawyer?”<br/>
Miss Maudie’s hand touched mine and I answered mildly enough, “Nome, just a&#160;<br/>
lady.”<br/>
Miss Stephanie eyed me suspiciously, decided that I meant no impertinence, and&#160;<br/>
contented herself with, “Well, you won’t get very far until you start wearing&#160;<br/>
dresses more often.”<br/>
Miss Maudie’s hand closed tightly on mine, and I said nothing. Its warmth was&#160;<br/>
enough.<br/>
Mrs. Grace Merriweather sat on my left, and I felt it would be polite to talk to her.&#160;<br/>
Mr. Merriweather, a faithful Methodist under duress, apparently saw nothing&#160;<br/>
personal in singing, “Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch&#160;<br/>
like me…” It was the general opinion of Maycomb, however, that Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Merriweather had sobered him up and made a reasonably useful citizen of him.&#160;<br/>
For certainly Mrs. Merriweather was the most devout lady in Maycomb. I&#160;<br/>
searched for a topic of interest to her. “What did you all study this afternoon?” I&#160;<br/>
asked.<br/>
“Oh child, those poor Mrunas,” she said, and was off. Few other questions would&#160;<br/>
be necessary.<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather’s large brown eyes always filled with tears when she&#160;<br/>
considered the oppressed. “Living in that jungle with nobody but J. Grimes&#160;<br/>
Everett,” she said. “Not a white person’ll go near ‘em but that saintly J. Grimes&#160;<br/>
Everett.”<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather played her voice like an organ; every word she said received&#160;<br/>
its full measure: “The poverty… the darkness… the immorality—nobody but J.&#160;<br/>
Grimes Everett knows. You know, when the church gave me that trip to the camp&#160;<br/>
grounds J. Grimes Everett said to me—”<br/>
“Was he there, ma’am? I thought—”<br/>
“Home on leave. J. Grimes Everett said to me, he said, ‘Mrs. Merriweather, you&#160;<br/>
have no conception, no con<i>cep</i>tion of what we are fighting over there.’ That’s&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=235></a>what he said to me.”<br/>
“Yes ma’am.”<br/>
“I said to him, ‘Mr. Everett,’ I said, ‘the ladies of the Maycomb Alabama&#160;<br/>
Methodist Episcopal Church South are behind you one hundred percent.’ That’s&#160;<br/>
what I said to him. And you know, right then and there I made a pledge in my&#160;<br/>
heart. I said to myself, when I go home I’m going to give a course on the Mrunas&#160;<br/>
and bring J. Grimes Everett’s message to Maycomb and that’s just what I’m&#160;<br/>
doing.”<br/>
“Yes ma’am.”<br/>
When Mrs. Merriweather shook her head, her black curls jiggled. “Jean Louise,”&#160;<br/>
she said, “you are a fortunate girl. You live in a Christian home with Christian&#160;<br/>
folks in a Christian town. Out there in J. Grimes Everett’s land there’s nothing but&#160;<br/>
sin and squalor.”<br/>
“Yes ma’am.”<br/>
“Sin and squalor—what was that, Gertrude?” Mrs. Merriweather turned on her&#160;<br/>
chimes for the lady sitting beside her. “Oh that. Well, I always say forgive and&#160;<br/>
forget, forgive and forget. Thing that church ought to do is help her lead a&#160;<br/>
Christian life for those children from here on out. Some of the men ought to go&#160;<br/>
out there and tell that preacher to encourage her.”<br/>
“Excuse me, Mrs. Merriweather,” I interrupted, “are you all talking about Mayella&#160;<br/>
Ewell?”<br/>
“May—? No, child. That darky’s wife. Tom’s wife, Tom—”<br/>
“Robinson, ma’am.”<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather turned back to her neighbor. “There’s one thing I truly believe,&#160;<br/>
Gertrude,” she continued, “but some people just don’t see it my way. If we just let&#160;<br/>
them know we forgive ‘em, that we’ve forgotten it, then this whole thing’ll blow&#160;<br/>
over.”<br/>
“Ah—Mrs. Merriweather,” I interrupted once more, “what’ll blow over?”<br/>
Again, she turned to me. Mrs. Merriweather was one of those childless adults who&#160;<br/>
find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children.&#160;<br/>
“Nothing, Jean Louise,” she said, in stately largo, “the cooks and field hands are&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=236></a>just dissatisfied, but they’re settling down now—they grumbled all next day after&#160;<br/>
that trial.”<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather faced Mrs. Farrow: “Gertrude, I tell you there’s nothing more&#160;<br/>
distracting than a sulky darky. Their mouths go down to here. Just ruins your day&#160;<br/>
to have one of ‘em in the kitchen. You know what I said to my Sophy, Gertrude? I&#160;<br/>
said, ’Sophy,‘ I said, ’you simply are not being a Christian today. Jesus Christ&#160;<br/>
never went around grumbling and complaining,‘ and you know, it did her good.&#160;<br/>
She took her eyes off that floor and said, ’Nome, Miz Merriweather, Jesus never&#160;<br/>
went around grumblin‘.’ I tell you, Gertrude, you never ought to let an&#160;<br/>
opportunity go by to witness for the Lord.”<br/>
I was reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at Finch’s Landing. When&#160;<br/>
I was very small, and if I had been very good during the day, Atticus would let me&#160;<br/>
pump its bellows while he picked out a tune with one finger. The last note would&#160;<br/>
linger as long as there was air to sustain it. Mrs. Merriweather had run out of air, I&#160;<br/>
judged, and was replenishing her supply while Mrs. Farrow composed herself to&#160;<br/>
speak.<br/>
Mrs. Farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet. She&#160;<br/>
had a fresh permanent wave, and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets. She&#160;<br/>
was the second most devout lady in Maycomb. She had a curious habit of&#160;<br/>
prefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound.<br/>
“S-s-s Grace,” she said, “it’s just like I was telling Brother Hutson the other day.&#160;<br/>
‘S-s-s Brother Hutson,’ I said, ‘looks like we’re fighting a losing battle, a losing&#160;<br/>
battle.’ I said, ‘S-s-s it doesn’t matter to ’em one bit. We can educate ‘em till&#160;<br/>
we’re blue in the face, we can try till we drop to make Christians out of ’em, but&#160;<br/>
there’s no lady safe in her bed these nights.‘ He said to me, ’Mrs. Farrow, I don’t&#160;<br/>
know what we’re coming to down here.‘ S-s-s I told him that was certainly a fact.”<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather nodded wisely. Her voice soared over the clink of coffee cups&#160;<br/>
and the soft bovine sounds of the ladies munching their dainties. “Gertrude,” she&#160;<br/>
said, “I tell you there are some good but misguided people in this town. Good, but&#160;<br/>
misguided. Folks in this town who think they’re doing right, I mean. Now far be it&#160;<br/>
from me to say who, but some of ‘em in this town thought they were doing the&#160;<br/>
right thing a while back, but all they did was stir ’em up. That’s all they did.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=237></a>Might’ve looked like the right thing to do at the time, I’m sure I don’t know, I’m&#160;<br/>
not read in that field, but sulky… dissatisfied… I tell you if my Sophy’d kept it up&#160;<br/>
another day I’d have let her go. It’s never entered that wool of hers that the only&#160;<br/>
reason I keep her is because this depression’s on and she needs her dollar and a&#160;<br/>
quarter every week she can get it.”<br/>
“His food doesn’t stick going down, does it?”<br/>
Miss Maudie said it. Two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth.&#160;<br/>
She had been sitting silently beside me, her coffee cup balanced on one knee. I&#160;<br/>
had lost the thread of conversation long ago, when they quit talking about Tom&#160;<br/>
Robinson’s wife, and had contented myself with thinking of Finch’s Landing and&#160;<br/>
the river. Aunt Alexandra had got it backwards: the business part of the meeting&#160;<br/>
was blood-curdling, the social hour was dreary.<br/>
“Maudie, I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” said Mrs. Merriweather.<br/>
“I’m sure you do,” Miss Maudie said shortly.<br/>
She said no more. When Miss Maudie was angry her brevity was icy. Something&#160;<br/>
had made her deeply angry, and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice. Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Merriweather reddened, glanced at me, and looked away. I could not see Mrs.&#160;<br/>
Farrow.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments,&#160;<br/>
neatly engaging Mrs. Merriweather and Mrs. Gates in brisk conversation. When&#160;<br/>
she had them well on the road with Mrs. Perkins, Aunt Alexandra stepped back.&#160;<br/>
She gave Miss Maudie a look of pure gratitude, and I wondered at the world of&#160;<br/>
women. Miss Maudie and Aunt Alexandra had never been especially close, and&#160;<br/>
here was Aunty silently thanking her for something. For what, I knew not. I was&#160;<br/>
content to learn that Aunt Alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude&#160;<br/>
for help given. There was no doubt about it, I must soon enter this world, where&#160;<br/>
on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water.<br/>
But I was more at home in my father’s world. People like Mr. Heck Tate did not&#160;<br/>
trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you; even Jem was not highly&#160;<br/>
critical unless you said something stupid. Ladies seemed to live in faint horror of&#160;<br/>
men, seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them. But I liked them.&#160;<br/>
There was something about them, no matter how much they cussed and drank and&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=238></a>gambled and chewed; no matter how undelectable they were, there was something&#160;<br/>
about them that I instinctively liked… they weren’t—<br/>
“Hypocrites, Mrs. Perkins, born hypocrites,” Mrs. Merriweather was saying. “At&#160;<br/>
least we don’t have that sin on our shoulders down here. People up there set ‘em&#160;<br/>
free, but you don’t see ’em settin‘ at the table with ’em. At least we don’t have the&#160;<br/>
deceit to say to ‘em yes you’re as good as we are but stay away from us. Down&#160;<br/>
here we just say you live your way and we’ll live ours. I think that woman, that&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Roosevelt’s lost her mind—just plain lost her mind coming down to&#160;<br/>
Birmingham and tryin’ to sit with ‘em. If I was the Mayor of Birmingham I’d—”<br/>
Well, neither of us was the Mayor of Birmingham, but I wished I was the&#160;<br/>
Governor of Alabama for one day: I’d let Tom Robinson go so quick the&#160;<br/>
Missionary Society wouldn’t have time to catch its breath. Calpurnia was telling&#160;<br/>
Miss Rachel’s cook the other day how bad Tom was taking things and she didn’t&#160;<br/>
stop talking when I came into the kitchen. She said there wasn’t a thing Atticus&#160;<br/>
could do to make being shut up easier for him, that the last thing he said to&#160;<br/>
Atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was, “Good-bye, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Finch, there ain’t nothin‘ you can do now, so there ain’t no use tryin’.” Calpurnia&#160;<br/>
said Atticus told her that the day they took Tom to prison he just gave up hope.&#160;<br/>
She said Atticus tried to explain things to him, and that he must do his best not to&#160;<br/>
lose hope because Atticus was doing his best to get him free. Miss Rachel’s cook&#160;<br/>
asked Calpurnia why didn’t Atticus just say yes, you’ll go free, and leave it at that<br/>
—seemed like that’d be a big comfort to Tom. Calpurnia said, “Because you ain’t&#160;<br/>
familiar with the law. First thing you learn when you’re in a lawin‘ family is that&#160;<br/>
there ain’t any definite answers to anything. Mr. Finch couldn’t say somethin’s so&#160;<br/>
when he doesn’t know for sure it’s so.”<br/>
The front door slammed and I heard Atticus’s footsteps in the hall. Automatically&#160;<br/>
I wondered what time it was. Not nearly time for him to be home, and on&#160;<br/>
Missionary Society days he usually stayed downtown until black dark.<br/>
He stopped in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and his face was white.<br/>
“Excuse me, ladies,” he said. “Go right ahead with your meeting, don’t let me&#160;<br/>
disturb you. Alexandra, could you come to the kitchen a minute? I want to borrow&#160;<br/>
Calpurnia for a while.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=239></a>He didn’t go through the diningroom, but went down the back hallway and&#160;<br/>
entered the kitchen from the rear door. Aunt Alexandra and I met him. The&#160;<br/>
diningroom door opened again and Miss Maudie joined us. Calpurnia had half&#160;<br/>
risen from her chair.<br/>
“Cal,” Atticus said, “I want you to go with me out to Helen Robinson’s house—”<br/>
“What’s the matter?” Aunt Alexandra asked, alarmed by the look on my father’s&#160;<br/>
face.<br/>
“Tom’s dead.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra put her hands to her mouth.<br/>
“They shot him,” said Atticus. “He was running. It was during their exercise&#160;<br/>
period. They said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started&#160;<br/>
climbing over. Right in front of them—”<br/>
“Didn’t they try to stop him? Didn’t they give him any warning?” Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra’s voice shook.<br/>
“Oh yes, the guards called to him to stop. They fired a few shots in the air, then to&#160;<br/>
kill. They got him just as he went over the fence. They said if he’d had two good&#160;<br/>
arms he’d have made it, he was moving that fast. Seventeen bullet holes in him.&#160;<br/>
They didn’t have to shoot him that much. Cal, I want you to come out with me&#160;<br/>
and help me tell Helen.”<br/>
“Yes sir,” she murmured, fumbling at her apron. Miss Maudie went to Calpurnia&#160;<br/>
and untied it.<br/>
“This is the last straw, Atticus,” Aunt Alexandra said.<br/>
“Depends on how you look at it,” he said. “What was one Negro, more or less,&#160;<br/>
among two hundred of ‘em? He wasn’t Tom to them, he was an escaping&#160;<br/>
prisoner.”<br/>
Atticus leaned against the refrigerator, pushed up his glasses, and rubbed his eyes.&#160;<br/>
“We had such a good chance,” he said. “I told him what I thought, but I couldn’t&#160;<br/>
in truth say that we had more than a good chance. I guess Tom was tired of white&#160;<br/>
men’s chances and preferred to take his own. Ready, Cal?”<br/>
“Yessir, Mr. Finch.”<br/>
“Then let’s go.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=240></a>Aunt Alexandra sat down in Calpurnia’s chair and put her hands to her face. She&#160;<br/>
sat quite still; she was so quiet I wondered if she would faint. I heard Miss&#160;<br/>
Maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps, and in the diningroom the&#160;<br/>
ladies chattered happily.<br/>
I thought Aunt Alexandra was crying, but when she took her hands away from her&#160;<br/>
face, she was not. She looked weary. She spoke, and her voice was flat.<br/>
“I can’t say I approve of everything he does, Maudie, but he’s my brother, and I&#160;<br/>
just want to know when this will ever end.” Her voice rose: “It tears him to&#160;<br/>
pieces. He doesn’t show it much, but it tears him to pieces. I’ve seen him when—<br/>
what else do they want from him, Maudie, what else?”<br/>
“What does who want, Alexandra?” Miss Maudie asked.<br/>
“I mean this town. They’re perfectly willing to let him do what they’re too afraid&#160;<br/>
to do themselves—it might lose ‘em a nickel. They’re perfectly willing to let him&#160;<br/>
wreck his health doing what they’re afraid to do, they’re—”<br/>
“Be quiet, they’ll hear you,” said Miss Maudie. “Have you ever thought of it this&#160;<br/>
way, Alexandra? Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we’re paying the highest&#160;<br/>
tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It’s that simple.”<br/>
“Who?” Aunt Alexandra never knew she was echoing her twelve-year-old&#160;<br/>
nephew.<br/>
“The handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked White&#160;<br/>
Only; the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody, not just us; the&#160;<br/>
handful of people with enough humility to think, when they look at a Negro, there&#160;<br/>
but for the Lord’s kindness am l.” Miss Maudie’s old crispness was returning:&#160;<br/>
“The handful of people in this town with background, that’s who they are.”<br/>
Had I been attentive, I would have had another scrap to add to Jem’s definition of&#160;<br/>
background, but I found myself shaking and couldn’t stop. I had seen Enfield&#160;<br/>
Prison Farm, and Atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me. It was the size&#160;<br/>
of a football field.<br/>
“Stop that shaking,” commanded Miss Maudie, and I stopped. “Get up,&#160;<br/>
Alexandra, we’ve left ‘em long enough.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=241></a>She took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose. She patted her hair&#160;<br/>
and said, “Do I show it?”<br/>
“Not a sign,” said Miss Maudie. “Are you together again, Jean Louise?”<br/>
“Yes ma’am.”<br/>
“Then let’s join the ladies,” she said grimly.<br/>
Their voices swelled when Miss Maudie opened the door to the diningroom. Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra was ahead of me, and I saw her head go up as she went through the&#160;<br/>
door.<br/>
“Oh, Mrs. Perkins,” she said, “you need some more coffee. Let me get it.”<br/>
“Calpurnia’s on an errand for a few minutes, Grace,” said Miss Maudie. “Let me&#160;<br/>
pass you some more of those dewberry tarts. ‘dyou hear what that cousin of mine&#160;<br/>
did the other day, the one who likes to go fishing?…”<br/>
And so they went, down the row of laughing women, around the diningroom,&#160;<br/>
refilling coffee cups, dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the&#160;<br/>
temporary domestic disaster of losing Calpurnia. The gentle hum began again.&#160;<br/>
“Yes sir, Mrs. Perkins, that J. Grimes Everett is a martyred saint, he… needed to&#160;<br/>
get married so they ran… to the beauty parlor every Saturday afternoon… soon as&#160;<br/>
the sun goes down. He goes to bed with the… chickens, a crate full of sick&#160;<br/>
chickens, Fred says that’s what started it all. Fred says…”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled. She looked at a tray of&#160;<br/>
cookies on the table and nodded at them. I carefully picked up the tray and&#160;<br/>
watched myself walk to Mrs. Merriweather. With my best company manners, I&#160;<br/>
asked her if she would have some.<br/>
After all, if Aunty could be a lady at a time like this, so could I.<br/>

<b>Chapter 25</b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=242></a>“Don’t do that, Scout. Set him out on the back steps.”<br/>
“Jem, are you crazy?…”<br/>
“I said set him out on the back steps.”<br/>
Sighing, I scooped up the small creature, placed him on the bottom step and went&#160;<br/>
back to my cot. September had come, but not a trace of cool weather with it, and&#160;<br/>
we were still sleeping on the back screen porch. Lightning bugs were still about,&#160;<br/>
the night crawlers and flying insects that beat against the screen the summer long&#160;<br/>
had not gone wherever they go when autumn comes.<br/>
A roly-poly had found his way inside the house; I reasoned that the tiny varmint&#160;<br/>
had crawled up the steps and under the door. I was putting my book on the floor&#160;<br/>
beside my cot when I saw him. The creatures are no more than an inch long, and&#160;<br/>
when you touch them they roll themselves into a tight gray ball.<br/>
I lay on my stomach, reached down and poked him. He rolled up. Then, feeling&#160;<br/>
safe, I suppose, he slowly unrolled. He traveled a few inches on his hundred legs&#160;<br/>
and I touched him again. He rolled up. Feeling sleepy, I decided to end things. My&#160;<br/>
hand was going down on him when Jem spoke.<br/>
Jem was scowling. It was probably a part of the stage he was going through, and I&#160;<br/>
wished he would hurry up and get through it. He was certainly never cruel to&#160;<br/>
animals, but I had never known his charity to embrace the insect world.<br/>
“Why couldn’t I mash him?” I asked.<br/>
“Because they don’t bother you,” Jem answered in the darkness. He had turned&#160;<br/>
out his reading light.<br/>
“Reckon you’re at the stage now where you don’t kill flies and mosquitoes now, I&#160;<br/>
reckon,” I said. “Lemme know when you change your mind. Tell you one thing,&#160;<br/>
though, I ain’t gonna sit around and not scratch a redbug.”<br/>
“Aw dry up,” he answered drowsily.<br/>
Jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day, not I. Comfortable, I&#160;<br/>
lay on my back and waited for sleep, and while waiting I thought of Dill. He had&#160;<br/>
left us the first of the month with firm assurances that he would return the minute&#160;<br/>
school was out—he guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to&#160;<br/>
spend his summers in Maycomb. Miss Rachel took us with them in the taxi to&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=243></a>Maycomb Junction, and Dill waved to us from the train window until he was out&#160;<br/>
of sight. He was not out of mind: I missed him. The last two days of his time with&#160;<br/>
us, Jem had taught him to swim—<br/>
Taught him to swim. I was wide awake, remembering what Dill had told me.<br/>
Barker’s Eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the Meridian highway about a mile&#160;<br/>
from town. It is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from&#160;<br/>
a passing motorist, and the short walk to the creek is easy, but the prospect of&#160;<br/>
walking all the way back home at dusk, when the traffic is light, is tiresome, and&#160;<br/>
swimmers are careful not to stay too late.<br/>
According to Dill, he and Jem had just come to the highway when they saw&#160;<br/>
Atticus driving toward them. He looked like he had not seen them, so they both&#160;<br/>
waved. Atticus finally slowed down; when they caught up with him he said,&#160;<br/>
“You’d better catch a ride back. I won’t be going home for a while.” Calpurnia&#160;<br/>
was in the back seat. Jem protested, then pleaded, and Atticus said, “All right, you&#160;<br/>
can come with us if you stay in the car.”<br/>
On the way to Tom Robinson’s, Atticus told them what had happened.<br/>
They turned off the highway, rode slowly by the dump and past the Ewell&#160;<br/>
residence, down the narrow lane to the Negro cabins. Dill said a crowd of black&#160;<br/>
children were playing marbles in Tom’s front yard. Atticus parked the car and got&#160;<br/>
out. Calpurnia followed him through the front gate.<br/>
Dill heard him ask one of the children, “Where’s your mother, Sam?” and heard&#160;<br/>
Sam say, “She down at Sis Stevens’s, Mr. Finch. Want me run fetch her?”<br/>
Dill said Atticus looked uncertain, then he said yes, and Sam scampered off. “Go&#160;<br/>
on with your game, boys,” Atticus said to the children.<br/>
A little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at Atticus. Dill said her hair&#160;<br/>
was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails, each ending in a bright bow. She grinned from ear&#160;<br/>
to ear and walked toward our father, but she was too small to navigate the steps.&#160;<br/>
Dill said Atticus went to her, took off his hat, and offered her his finger. She&#160;<br/>
grabbed it and he eased her down the steps. Then he gave her to Calpurnia.<br/>
Sam was trotting behind his mother when they came up. Dill said Helen said,&#160;<br/>
“‘evenin’, Mr. Finch, won’t you have a seat?” But she didn’t say any more.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=244></a>Neither did Atticus.<br/>
“Scout,” said Dill, “she just fell down in the dirt. Just fell down in the dirt, like a&#160;<br/>
giant with a big foot just came along and stepped on her. Just ump—” Dill’s fat&#160;<br/>
foot hit the ground. “Like you’d step on an ant.”<br/>
Dill said Calpurnia and Atticus lifted Helen to her feet and half carried, half&#160;<br/>
walked her to the cabin. They stayed inside a long time, and Atticus came out&#160;<br/>
alone. When they drove back by the dump, some of the Ewells hollered at them,&#160;<br/>
but Dill didn’t catch what they said.<br/>
Maycomb was interested by the news of Tom’s death for perhaps two days; two&#160;<br/>
days was enough for the information to spread through the county. “Did you hear&#160;<br/>
about?… No? Well, they say he was runnin‘ fit to beat lightnin’…” To Maycomb,&#160;<br/>
Tom’s death was typical. Typical of a nigger to cut and run. Typical of a nigger’s&#160;<br/>
mentality to have no plan, no thought for the future, just run blind first chance he&#160;<br/>
saw. Funny thing, Atticus Finch might’ve got him off scot free, but wait—? Hell&#160;<br/>
no. You know how they are. Easy come, easy go. Just shows you, that Robinson&#160;<br/>
boy was legally married, they say he kept himself clean, went to church and all&#160;<br/>
that, but when it comes down to the line the veneer’s mighty thin. Nigger always&#160;<br/>
comes out in ‘em.<br/>
A few more details, enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn, then&#160;<br/>
nothing to talk about until&#160;<i>The Maycomb Tribune</i>&#160;appeared the following&#160;<br/>
Thursday. There was a brief obituary in the Colored News, but there was also an&#160;<br/>
editorial.<br/>
Mr. B. B. Underwood was at his most bitter, and he couldn’t have cared less who&#160;<br/>
canceled advertising and subscriptions. (But Maycomb didn’t play that way: Mr.&#160;<br/>
Underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to, he’d&#160;<br/>
still get his advertising and subscriptions. If he wanted to make a fool of himself&#160;<br/>
in his paper that was his business.) Mr. Underwood didn’t talk about miscarriages&#160;<br/>
of justice, he was writing so children could understand. Mr. Underwood simply&#160;<br/>
figured it was a sin to kill cripples, be they standing, sitting, or escaping. He&#160;<br/>
likened Tom’s death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and&#160;<br/>
children, and Maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical&#160;<br/>
enough to be reprinted in&#160;<i>The Montgomery Advertiser</i>.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=245></a>How could this be so, I wondered, as I read Mr. Underwood’s editorial. Senseless&#160;<br/>
killing—Tom had been given due process of law to the day of his death; he had&#160;<br/>
been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had&#160;<br/>
fought for him all the way. Then Mr. Underwood’s meaning became clear:&#160;<br/>
Atticus had used every tool available to free men to save Tom Robinson, but in&#160;<br/>
the secret courts of men’s hearts Atticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the&#160;<br/>
minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed.<br/>
The name Ewell gave me a queasy feeling. Maycomb had lost no time in getting&#160;<br/>
Mr. Ewell’s views on Tom’s demise and passing them along through that English&#160;<br/>
Channel of gossip, Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Stephanie told Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra in Jem’s presence (“Oh foot, he’s old enough to listen.”) that Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ewell said it made one down and about two more to go. Jem told me not to be&#160;<br/>
afraid, Mr. Ewell was more hot gas than anything. Jem also told me that if I&#160;<br/>
breathed a word to Atticus, if in any way I let Atticus know I knew, Jem would&#160;<br/>
personally never speak to me again.<br/>

<b>Chapter 26</b><br/>
School started, and so did our daily trips past the Radley Place. Jem was in the&#160;<br/>
seventh grade and went to high school, beyond the grammar-school building; I&#160;<br/>
was now in the third grade, and our routines were so different I only walked to&#160;<br/>
school with Jem in the mornings and saw him at mealtimes. He went out for&#160;<br/>
football, but was too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team&#160;<br/>
water buckets. This he did with enthusiasm; most afternoons he was seldom home&#160;<br/>
before dark.<br/>
The Radley Place had ceased to terrify me, but it was no less gloomy, no less&#160;<br/>
chilly under its great oaks, and no less uninviting. Mr. Nathan Radley could still&#160;<br/>
be seen on a clear day, walking to and from town; we knew Boo was there, for the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=246></a>same old reason—nobody’d seen him carried out yet. I sometimes felt a twinge of&#160;<br/>
remorse, when passing by the old place, at ever having taken part in what must&#160;<br/>
have been sheer torment to Arthur Radley—what reasonable recluse wants&#160;<br/>
children peeping through his shutters, delivering greetings on the end of a fishing-<br/>
pole, wandering in his collards at night? And yet I remembered. Two Indian-head&#160;<br/>
pennies, chewing gum, soap dolls, a rusty medal, a broken watch and chain. Jem&#160;<br/>
must have put them away somewhere. I stopped and looked at the tree one&#160;<br/>
afternoon: the trunk was swelling around its cement patch. The patch itself was&#160;<br/>
turning yellow.<br/>
We had almost seen him a couple of times, a good enough score for anybody.<br/>
But I still looked for him each time I went by. Maybe someday we would see him.&#160;<br/>
I imagined how it would be: when it happened, he’d just be sitting in the swing&#160;<br/>
when I came along. “Hidy do, Mr. Arthur,” I would say, as if I had said it every&#160;<br/>
afternoon of my life. “Evening, Jean Louise,” he would say, as if he had said it&#160;<br/>
every afternoon of my life, “right pretty spell we’re having, isn’t it?” “Yes sir,&#160;<br/>
right pretty,” I would say, and go on.<br/>
It was only a fantasy. We would never see him. He probably did go out when the&#160;<br/>
moon was down and gaze upon Miss Stephanie Crawford. I’d have picked&#160;<br/>
somebody else to look at, but that was his business. He would never gaze at us.<br/>
“You aren’t starting that again, are you?” said Atticus one night, when I expressed&#160;<br/>
a stray desire just to have one good look at Boo Radley before I died. “If you are,&#160;<br/>
I’ll tell you right now: stop it. I’m too old to go chasing you off the Radley&#160;<br/>
property. Besides, it’s dangerous. You might get shot. You know Mr. Nathan&#160;<br/>
shoots at every shadow he sees, even shadows that leave size-four bare footprints.&#160;<br/>
You were lucky not to be killed.”<br/>
I hushed then and there. At the same time I marveled at Atticus. This was the first&#160;<br/>
he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew.&#160;<br/>
And it had happened years ago. No, only last summer—no, summer before last,&#160;<br/>
when… time was playing tricks on me. I must remember to ask Jem.<br/>
So many things had happened to us, Boo Radley was the least of our fears.&#160;<br/>
Atticus said he didn’t see how anything else could happen, that things had a way&#160;<br/>
of settling down, and after enough time passed people would forget that Tom&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=247></a>Robinson’s existence was ever brought to their attention.<br/>
Perhaps Atticus was right, but the events of the summer hung over us like smoke&#160;<br/>
in a closed room. The adults in Maycomb never discussed the case with Jem and&#160;<br/>
me; it seemed that they discussed it with their children, and their attitude must&#160;<br/>
have been that neither of us could help having Atticus for a parent, so their&#160;<br/>
children must be nice to us in spite of him. The children would never have&#160;<br/>
thought that up for themselves: had our classmates been left to their own devices,&#160;<br/>
Jem and I would have had several swift, satisfying fist-fights apiece and ended the&#160;<br/>
matter for good. As it was, we were compelled to hold our heads high and be,&#160;<br/>
respectively, a gentleman and a lady. In a way, it was like the era of Mrs. Henry&#160;<br/>
Lafayette Dubose, without all her yelling. There was one odd thing, though, that I&#160;<br/>
never understood: in spite of Atticus’s shortcomings as a parent, people were&#160;<br/>
content to re-elect him to the state legislature that year, as usual, without&#160;<br/>
opposition. I came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar, I withdrew&#160;<br/>
from them, and never thought about them until I was forced to.<br/>
I was forced to one day in school. Once a week, we had a Current Events period.&#160;<br/>
Each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents,&#160;<br/>
and reveal them to the class. This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils:&#160;<br/>
standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise;&#160;<br/>
delivering a short talk made him word-conscious; learning his current event&#160;<br/>
strengthened his memory; being singled out made him more than ever anxious to&#160;<br/>
return to the Group.<br/>
The idea was profound, but as usual, in Maycomb it didn’t work very well. In the&#160;<br/>
first place, few rural children had access to newspapers, so the burden of Current&#160;<br/>
Events was borne by the town children, convincing the bus children more deeply&#160;<br/>
that the town children got all the attention anyway. The rural children who could,&#160;<br/>
usually brought clippings from what they called The Grit Paper, a publication&#160;<br/>
spurious in the eyes of Miss Gates, our teacher. Why she frowned when a child&#160;<br/>
recited from The Grit Paper I never knew, but in some way it was associated with&#160;<br/>
liking fiddling, eating syrupy biscuits for lunch, being a holy-roller, singing&#160;<br/>
Sweetly Sings the Donkey and pronouncing it dunkey, all of which the state paid&#160;<br/>
teachers to discourage.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=248></a>Even so, not many of the children knew what a Current Event was. Little Chuck&#160;<br/>
Little, a hundred years old in his knowledge of cows and their habits, was halfway&#160;<br/>
through an Uncle Natchell story when Miss Gates stopped him: “Charles, that is&#160;<br/>
not a current event. That is an advertisement.”<br/>
Cecil Jacobs knew what one was, though. When his turn came, he went to the&#160;<br/>
front of the room and began, “Old Hitler—”<br/>
“Adolf Hitler, Cecil,” said Miss Gates. “One never begins with Old anybody.”<br/>
“Yes ma’am,” he said. “Old Adolf Hitler has been prosecutin‘ the—”<br/>
“Persecuting Cecil…”<br/>
“Nome, Miss Gates, it says here—well anyway, old Adolf Hitler has been after&#160;<br/>
the Jews and he’s puttin‘ ’em in prisons and he’s taking away all their property&#160;<br/>
and he won’t let any of ‘em out of the country and he’s washin’ all the feeble-<br/>
minded and—”<br/>
“Washing the feeble-minded?”<br/>
“Yes ma’am, Miss Gates, I reckon they don’t have sense enough to wash&#160;<br/>
themselves, I don’t reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean. Well anyway,&#160;<br/>
Hitler’s started a program to round up all the half-Jews too and he wants to&#160;<br/>
register ‘em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and I think this is a&#160;<br/>
bad thing and that’s my current event.”<br/>
“Very good, Cecil,” said Miss Gates. Puffing, Cecil returned to his seat.<br/>
A hand went up in the back of the room. “How can he do that?”<br/>
“Who do what?” asked Miss Gates patiently.<br/>
“I mean how can Hitler just put a lot of folks in a pen like that, looks like the&#160;<br/>
govamint’d stop him,” said the owner of the hand.<br/>
“Hitler is the government,” said Miss Gates, and seizing an opportunity to make&#160;<br/>
education dynamic, she went to the blackboard. She printed DEMOCRACY in&#160;<br/>
large letters. “Democracy,” she said. “Does anybody have a definition?”<br/>
“Us,” somebody said.<br/>
I raised my hand, remembering an old campaign slogan Atticus had once told me&#160;<br/>
about.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=249></a>“What do you think it means, Jean Louise?”<br/>
“‘Equal rights for all, special privileges for none,’” I quoted.<br/>
“Very good, Jean Louise, very good,” Miss Gates smiled. In front of&#160;<br/>
DEMOCRACY, she printed WE ARE A. “Now class, say it all together, ‘We are&#160;<br/>
a democracy.’”<br/>
We said it. Then Miss Gates said, “That’s the difference between America and&#160;<br/>
Germany. We are a democracy and Germany is a dictatorship. Dictator-ship,” she&#160;<br/>
said. “Over here we don’t believe in persecuting anybody. Persecution comes&#160;<br/>
from people who are prejudiced. Prejudice,” she enunciated carefully. “There are&#160;<br/>
no better people in the world than the Jews, and why Hitler doesn’t think so is a&#160;<br/>
mystery to me.”<br/>
An inquiring soul in the middle of the room said, “Why don’t they like the Jews,&#160;<br/>
you reckon, Miss Gates?”<br/>
“I don’t know, Henry. They contribute to every society they live in, and most of&#160;<br/>
all, they are a deeply religious people. Hitler’s trying to do away with religion, so&#160;<br/>
maybe he doesn’t like them for that reason.”<br/>
Cecil spoke up. “Well I don’t know for certain,” he said, “they’re supposed to&#160;<br/>
change money or somethin‘, but that ain’t no cause to persecute ’em. They’re&#160;<br/>
white, ain’t they?”<br/>
Miss Gates said, “When you get to high school, Cecil, you’ll learn that the Jews&#160;<br/>
have been persecuted since the beginning of history, even driven out of their own&#160;<br/>
country. It’s one of the most terrible stories in history. Time for arithmetic,&#160;<br/>
children.”<br/>
As I had never liked arithmetic, I spent the period looking out the window. The&#160;<br/>
only time I ever saw Atticus scowl was when Elmer Davis would give us the&#160;<br/>
latest on Hitler. Atticus would snap off the radio and say, “Hmp!” I asked him&#160;<br/>
once why he was impatient with Hitler and Atticus said, “Because he’s a maniac.”<br/>
This would not do, I mused, as the class proceeded with its sums. One maniac and&#160;<br/>
millions of German folks. Looked to me like they’d shut Hitler in a pen instead of&#160;<br/>
letting him shut them up. There was something else wrong—I would ask my&#160;<br/>
father about it.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=250></a>I did, and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didn’t&#160;<br/>
know the answer.<br/>
“But it’s okay to hate Hitler?”<br/>
“It is not,” he said. “It’s not okay to hate anybody.”<br/>
“Atticus,” I said, “there’s somethin‘ I don’t understand. Miss Gates said it was&#160;<br/>
awful, Hitler doin’ like he does, she got real red in the face about it—”<br/>
“I should think she would.”<br/>
“But—”<br/>
“Yes?”<br/>
“Nothing, sir.” I went away, not sure that I could explain to Atticus what was on&#160;<br/>
my mind, not sure that I could clarify what was only a feeling. Perhaps Jem could&#160;<br/>
provide the answer. Jem understood school things better than Atticus.<br/>
Jem was worn out from a day’s water-carrying. There were at least twelve banana&#160;<br/>
peels on the floor by his bed, surrounding an empty milk bottle. “Whatcha stuffin‘&#160;<br/>
for?” I asked.<br/>
“Coach says if I can gain twenty-five pounds by year after next I can play,” he&#160;<br/>
said. “This is the quickest way.”<br/>
“If you don’t throw it all up. Jem,” I said, “I wanta ask you somethin‘.”<br/>
“Shoot.” He put down his book and stretched his legs.<br/>
“Miss Gates is a nice lady, ain’t she?”<br/>
“Why sure,” said Jem. “I liked her when I was in her room.”<br/>
“She hates Hitler a lot…”<br/>
“What’s wrong with that?”<br/>
“Well, she went on today about how bad it was him treatin‘ the Jews like that.&#160;<br/>
Jem, it’s not right to persecute anybody, is it? I mean have mean thoughts about&#160;<br/>
anybody, even, is it?”<br/>
“Gracious no, Scout. What’s eatin‘ you?”<br/>
“Well, coming out of the courthouse that night Miss Gates was—she was goin‘&#160;<br/>
down the steps in front of us, you musta not seen her—she was talking with Miss&#160;<br/>
Stephanie Crawford. I heard her say it’s time somebody taught ’em a lesson, they&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=251></a>were gettin‘ way above themselves, an’ the next thing they think they can do is&#160;<br/>
marry us. Jem, how can you hate Hitler so bad an‘ then turn around and be ugly&#160;<br/>
about folks right at home—”<br/>
Jem was suddenly furious. He leaped off the bed, grabbed me by the collar and&#160;<br/>
shook me. “I never wanta hear about that courthouse again, ever, ever, you hear&#160;<br/>
me? You hear me? Don’t you ever say one word to me about it again, you hear?&#160;<br/>
Now go on!”<br/>
I was too surprised to cry. I crept from Jem’s room and shut the door softly, lest&#160;<br/>
undue noise set him off again. Suddenly tired, I wanted Atticus. He was in the&#160;<br/>
livingroom, and I went to him and tried to get in his lap.<br/>
Atticus smiled. “You’re getting so big now, I’ll just have to hold a part of you.”&#160;<br/>
He held me close. “Scout,” he said softly, “don’t let Jem get you down. He’s&#160;<br/>
having a rough time these days. I heard you back there.”<br/>
Atticus said that Jem was trying hard to forget something, but what he was really&#160;<br/>
doing was storing it away for a while, until enough time passed. Then he would&#160;<br/>
be able to think about it and sort things out. When he was able to think about it,&#160;<br/>
Jem would be himself again.<br/>

<b>Chapter 27</b><br/>
Things did settle down, after a fashion, as Atticus said they would. By the middle&#160;<br/>
of October, only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two Maycomb&#160;<br/>
citizens. No, there were three things, and they did not directly concern us—the&#160;<br/>
Finches—but in a way they did.<br/>
The first thing was that Mr. Bob Ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days&#160;<br/>
and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteen-thirties: he was&#160;<br/>
the only man I ever heard of who was fired from the WPA for laziness. I suppose&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=252></a>his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry, but his job lasted&#160;<br/>
only as long as his notoriety: Mr. Ewell found himself as forgotten as Tom&#160;<br/>
Robinson. Thereafter, he resumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare&#160;<br/>
office for his check, and received it with no grace amid obscure mutterings that&#160;<br/>
the bastards who thought they ran this town wouldn’t permit an honest man to&#160;<br/>
make a living. Ruth Jones, the welfare lady, said Mr. Ewell openly accused&#160;<br/>
Atticus of getting his job. She was upset enough to walk down to Atticus’s office&#160;<br/>
and tell him about it. Atticus told Miss Ruth not to fret, that if Bob Ewell wanted&#160;<br/>
to discuss Atticus’s “getting” his job, he knew the way to the office.<br/>
The second thing happened to Judge Taylor. Judge Taylor was not a Sunday-night&#160;<br/>
churchgoer: Mrs. Taylor was. Judge Taylor savored his Sunday night hour alone&#160;<br/>
in his big house, and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the&#160;<br/>
writings of Bob Taylor (no kin, but the judge would have been proud to claim it).&#160;<br/>
One Sunday night, lost in fruity metaphors and florid diction, Judge Taylor’s&#160;<br/>
attention was wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise. “Hush,”&#160;<br/>
he said to Ann Taylor, his fat nondescript dog. Then he realized he was speaking&#160;<br/>
to an empty room; the scratching noise was coming from the rear of the house.&#160;<br/>
Judge Taylor clumped to the back porch to let Ann out and found the screen door&#160;<br/>
swinging open. A shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye, and that was&#160;<br/>
all he saw of his visitor. Mrs. Taylor came home from church to find her husband&#160;<br/>
in his chair, lost in the writings of Bob Taylor, with a shotgun across his lap.<br/>
The third thing happened to Helen Robinson, Tom’s widow. If Mr. Ewell was as&#160;<br/>
forgotten as Tom Robinson, Tom Robinson was as forgotten as Boo Radley. But&#160;<br/>
Tom was not forgotten by his employer, Mr. Link Deas. Mr. Link Deas made a&#160;<br/>
job for Helen. He didn’t really need her, but he said he felt right bad about the&#160;<br/>
way things turned out. I never knew who took care of her children while Helen&#160;<br/>
was away. Calpurnia said it was hard on Helen, because she had to walk nearly a&#160;<br/>
mile out of her way to avoid the Ewells, who, according to Helen, “chunked at&#160;<br/>
her” the first time she tried to use the public road. Mr. Link Deas eventually&#160;<br/>
received the impression that Helen was coming to work each morning from the&#160;<br/>
wrong direction, and dragged the reason out of her. “Just let it be, Mr. Link,&#160;<br/>
please suh,” Helen begged. “The hell I will,” said Mr. Link. He told her to come&#160;<br/>
by his store that afternoon before she left. She did, and Mr. Link closed his store,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=253></a>put his hat firmly on his head, and walked Helen home. He walked her the short&#160;<br/>
way, by the Ewells‘. On his way back, Mr. Link stopped at the crazy gate.<br/>
“Ewell?” he called. “I say Ewell!”<br/>
The windows, normally packed with children, were empty.<br/>
“I know every last one of you’s in there a-layin‘ on the floor! Now hear me, Bob&#160;<br/>
Ewell: if I hear one more peep outa my girl Helen about not bein’ able to walk&#160;<br/>
this road I’ll have you in jail before sundown!” Mr. Link spat in the dust and&#160;<br/>
walked home.<br/>
Helen went to work next morning and used the public road. Nobody chunked at&#160;<br/>
her, but when she was a few yards beyond the Ewell house, she looked around&#160;<br/>
and saw Mr. Ewell walking behind her. She turned and walked on, and Mr. Ewell&#160;<br/>
kept the same distance behind her until she reached Mr. Link Deas’s house. All&#160;<br/>
the way to the house, Helen said, she heard a soft voice behind her, crooning foul&#160;<br/>
words. Thoroughly frightened, she telephoned Mr. Link at his store, which was&#160;<br/>
not too far from his house. As Mr. Link came out of his store he saw Mr. Ewell&#160;<br/>
leaning on the fence. Mr. Ewell said, “Don’t you look at me, Link Deas, like I&#160;<br/>
was dirt. I ain’t jumped your—”<br/>
“First thing you can do, Ewell, is get your stinkin‘ carcass off my property.&#160;<br/>
You’re leanin’ on it an‘ I can’t afford fresh paint for it. Second thing you can do&#160;<br/>
is stay away from my cook or I’ll have you up for assault—”<br/>
“I ain’t touched her, Link Deas, and ain’t about to go with no nigger!”<br/>
“You don’t have to touch her, all you have to do is make her afraid, an‘ if assault&#160;<br/>
ain’t enough to keep you locked up awhile, I’ll get you in on the Ladies’ Law, so&#160;<br/>
get outa my sight! If you don’t think I mean it, just bother that girl again!”<br/>
Mr. Ewell evidently thought he meant it, for Helen reported no further trouble.<br/>
“I don’t like it, Atticus, I don’t like it at all,” was Aunt Alexandra’s assessment of&#160;<br/>
these events. “That man seems to have a permanent running grudge against&#160;<br/>
everybody connected with that case. I know how that kind are about paying off&#160;<br/>
grudges, but I don’t understand why he should harbor one—he had his way in&#160;<br/>
court, didn’t he?”<br/>
“I think I understand,” said Atticus. “It might be because he knows in his heart&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=254></a>that very few people in Maycomb really believed his and Mayella’s yarns. He&#160;<br/>
thought he’d be a hero, but all he got for his pain was… was, okay, we’ll convict&#160;<br/>
this Negro but get back to your dump. He’s had his fling with about everybody&#160;<br/>
now, so he ought to be satisfied. He’ll settle down when the weather changes.”<br/>
“But why should he try to burgle John Taylor’s house? He obviously didn’t know&#160;<br/>
John was home or he wouldn’t‘ve tried. Only lights John shows on Sunday nights&#160;<br/>
are on the front porch and back in his den…”<br/>
“You don’t know if Bob Ewell cut that screen, you don’t know who did it,” said&#160;<br/>
Atticus. “But I can guess. I proved him a liar but John made him look like a fool.&#160;<br/>
All the time Ewell was on the stand I couldn’t dare look at John and keep a&#160;<br/>
straight face. John looked at him as if he were a three-legged chicken or a square&#160;<br/>
egg. Don’t tell me judges don’t try to prejudice juries,” Atticus chuckled.<br/>
By the end of October, our lives had become the familiar routine of school, play,&#160;<br/>
study. Jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it was he wanted to&#160;<br/>
forget, and our classmates mercifully let us forget our father’s eccentricities. Cecil&#160;<br/>
Jacobs asked me one time if Atticus was a Radical. When I asked Atticus, Atticus&#160;<br/>
was so amused I was rather annoyed, but he said he wasn’t laughing at me. He&#160;<br/>
said, “You tell Cecil I’m about as radical as Cotton Tom Heflin.”<br/>
Aunt Alexandra was thriving. Miss Maudie must have silenced the whole&#160;<br/>
missionary society at one blow, for Aunty again ruled that roost. Her refreshments&#160;<br/>
grew even more delicious. I learned more about the poor Mrunas’ social life from&#160;<br/>
listening to Mrs. Merriweather: they had so little sense of family that the whole&#160;<br/>
tribe was one big family. A child had as many fathers as there were men in the&#160;<br/>
community, as many mothers as there were women. J. Grimes Everett was doing&#160;<br/>
his utmost to change this state of affairs, and desperately needed our prayers.<br/>
Maycomb was itself again. Precisely the same as last year and the year before&#160;<br/>
that, with only two minor changes. Firstly, people had removed from their store&#160;<br/>
windows and automobiles the stickers that said NRA—WE DO OUR PART. I&#160;<br/>
asked Atticus why, and he said it was because the National Recovery Act was&#160;<br/>
dead. I asked who killed it: he said nine old men.<br/>
The second change in Maycomb since last year was not one of national&#160;<br/>
significance. Until then, Halloween in Maycomb was a completely unorganized&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=255></a>affair. Each child did what he wanted to do, with assistance from other children if&#160;<br/>
there was anything to be moved, such as placing a light buggy on top of the livery&#160;<br/>
stable. But parents thought things went too far last year, when the peace of Miss&#160;<br/>
Tutti and Miss Frutti was shattered.<br/>
Misses Tutti and Frutti Barber were maiden ladies, sisters, who lived together in&#160;<br/>
the only Maycomb residence boasting a cellar. The Barber ladies were rumored to&#160;<br/>
be Republicans, having migrated from Clanton, Alabama, in 1911. Their ways&#160;<br/>
were strange to us, and why they wanted a cellar nobody knew, but they wanted&#160;<br/>
one and they dug one, and they spent the rest of their lives chasing generations of&#160;<br/>
children out of it.<br/>
Misses Tutti and Frutti (their names were Sarah and Frances), aside from their&#160;<br/>
Yankee ways, were both deaf. Miss Tutti denied it and lived in a world of silence,&#160;<br/>
but Miss Frutti, not about to miss anything, employed an ear trumpet so enormous&#160;<br/>
that Jem declared it was a loudspeaker from one of those dog Victrolas.<br/>
With these facts in mind and Halloween at hand, some wicked children had&#160;<br/>
waited until the Misses Barber were thoroughly asleep, slipped into their&#160;<br/>
livingroom (nobody but the Radleys locked up at night), stealthily made away&#160;<br/>
with every stick of furniture therein, and hid it in the cellar. I deny having taken&#160;<br/>
part in such a thing.<br/>
“I heard ‘em!” was the cry that awoke the Misses Barber’s neighbors at dawn&#160;<br/>
next morning. “Heard ’em drive a truck up to the door! Stomped around like&#160;<br/>
horses. They’re in New Orleans by now!”<br/>
Miss Tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town two days&#160;<br/>
ago had purloined their furniture. “Da-rk they were,” she said. “Syrians.”<br/>
Mr. Heck Tate was summoned. He surveyed the area and said he thought it was a&#160;<br/>
local job. Miss Frutti said she’d know a Maycomb voice anywhere, and there&#160;<br/>
were no Maycomb voices in that parlor last night—rolling their r’s all over her&#160;<br/>
premises, they were. Nothing less than the bloodhounds must be used to locate&#160;<br/>
their furniture, Miss Tutti insisted, so Mr. Tate was obliged to go ten miles out the&#160;<br/>
road, round up the county hounds, and put them on the trail.<br/>
Mr. Tate started them off at the Misses Barber’s front steps, but all they did was&#160;<br/>
run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door. When Mr. Tate&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=256></a>set them in motion three times, he finally guessed the truth. By noontime that day,&#160;<br/>
there was not a barefooted child to be seen in Maycomb and nobody took off his&#160;<br/>
shoes until the hounds were returned.<br/>
So the Maycomb ladies said things would be different this year. The high-school&#160;<br/>
auditorium would be open, there would be a pageant for the grown-ups; apple-<br/>
bobbing, taffy-pulling, pinning the tail on the donkey for the children. There&#160;<br/>
would also be a prize of twenty-five cents for the best Halloween costume,&#160;<br/>
created by the wearer.<br/>
Jem and I both groaned. Not that we’d ever done anything, it was the principle of&#160;<br/>
the thing. Jem considered himself too old for Halloween anyway; he said he&#160;<br/>
wouldn’t be caught anywhere near the high school at something like that. Oh&#160;<br/>
well, I thought, Atticus would take me.<br/>
I soon learned, however, that my services would be required on stage that&#160;<br/>
evening. Mrs. Grace Merriweather had composed an original pageant entitled&#160;<br/>
<i>Maycomb County: Ad Astra Per Aspera</i>, and I was to be a ham. She thought it&#160;<br/>
would be adorable if some of the children were costumed to represent the&#160;<br/>
county’s agricultural products: Cecil Jacobs would be dressed up to look like a&#160;<br/>
cow; Agnes Boone would make a lovely butterbean, another child would be a&#160;<br/>
peanut, and on down the line until Mrs. Merriweather’s imagination and the&#160;<br/>
supply of children were exhausted.<br/>
Our only duties, as far as I could gather from our two rehearsals, were to enter&#160;<br/>
from stage left as Mrs. Merriweather (not only the author, but the narrator)&#160;<br/>
identified us. When she called out, “Pork,” that was my cue. Then the assembled&#160;<br/>
company would sing, “Maycomb County, Maycomb County, we will aye be true&#160;<br/>
to thee,” as the grand finale, and Mrs. Merriweather would mount the stage with&#160;<br/>
the state flag.<br/>
My costume was not much of a problem. Mrs. Crenshaw, the local seamstress,&#160;<br/>
had as much imagination as Mrs. Merriweather. Mrs. Crenshaw took some&#160;<br/>
chicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham. This she covered with&#160;<br/>
brown cloth, and painted it to resemble the original. I could duck under and&#160;<br/>
someone would pull the contraption down over my head. It came almost to my&#160;<br/>
knees. Mrs. Crenshaw thoughtfully left two peepholes for me. She did a fine job.&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=257></a>Jem said I looked exactly like a ham with legs. There were several discomforts,&#160;<br/>
though: it was hot, it was a close fit; if my nose itched I couldn’t scratch, and once&#160;<br/>
inside I could not get out of it alone.<br/>
When Halloween came, I assumed that the whole family would be present to&#160;<br/>
watch me perform, but I was disappointed. Atticus said as tactfully as he could&#160;<br/>
that he just didn’t think he could stand a pageant tonight, he was all in. He had&#160;<br/>
been in Montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon. He&#160;<br/>
thought Jem might escort me if I asked him.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra said she just had to get to bed early, she’d been decorating the&#160;<br/>
stage all afternoon and was worn out—she stopped short in the middle of her&#160;<br/>
sentence. She closed her mouth, then opened it to say something, but no words&#160;<br/>
came.<br/>
“‘s matter, Aunty?” I asked.<br/>
“Oh nothing, nothing,” she said, “somebody just walked over my grave.” She put&#160;<br/>
away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension, and&#160;<br/>
suggested that I give the family a preview in the livingroom. So Jem squeezed me&#160;<br/>
into my costume, stood at the livingroom door, called out “Po-ork,” exactly as&#160;<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather would have done, and I marched in. Atticus and Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra were delighted.<br/>
I repeated my part for Calpurnia in the kitchen and she said I was wonderful. I&#160;<br/>
wanted to go across the street to show Miss Maudie, but Jem said she’d probably&#160;<br/>
be at the pageant anyway.<br/>
After that, it didn’t matter whether they went or not. Jem said he would take me.&#160;<br/>
Thus began our longest journey together.<br/>

<b>Chapter 28</b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=258></a>The weather was unusually warm for the last day of October. We didn’t even&#160;<br/>
need jackets. The wind was growing stronger, and Jem said it might be raining&#160;<br/>
before we got home. There was no moon. The street light on the corner cast sharp&#160;<br/>
shadows on the Radley house. I heard Jem laugh softly. “Bet nobody bothers&#160;<br/>
them tonight,” he said. Jem was carrying my ham costume, rather awkwardly, as&#160;<br/>
it was hard to hold. I thought it gallant of him to do so.<br/>
“It is a scary place though, ain’t it?” I said. “Boo doesn’t mean anybody any&#160;<br/>
harm, but I’m right glad you’re along.” “You know Atticus wouldn’t let you go to&#160;<br/>
the schoolhouse by yourself,” Jem said.<br/>
“Don’t see why, it’s just around the corner and across the yard.”<br/>
“That yard’s a mighty long place for little girls to cross at night,” Jem teased.&#160;<br/>
“Ain’t you scared of haints?”<br/>
We laughed. Haints, Hot Steams, incantations, secret signs, had vanished with our&#160;<br/>
years as mist with sunrise. “What was that old thing,” Jem said, “Angel bright,&#160;<br/>
life-in-death; get off the road, don’t suck my breath.”<br/>
“Cut it out, now,” I said. We were in front of the Radley Place.<br/>
Jem said, “Boo must not be at home. Listen.”<br/>
High above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in&#160;<br/>
blissful unawareness of whose tree he sat in, plunging from the shrill kee, kee of&#160;<br/>
the sunflower bird to the irascible qua-ack of a bluejay, to the sad lament of Poor&#160;<br/>
Will, Poor Will, Poor Will.<br/>
We turned the corner and I tripped on a root growing in the road. Jem tried to help&#160;<br/>
me, but all he did was drop my costume in the dust. I didn’t fall, though, and soon&#160;<br/>
we were on our way again.<br/>
We turned off the road and entered the schoolyard. It was pitch black.<br/>
“How do you know where we’re at, Jem?” I asked, when we had gone a few steps.<br/>
“I can tell we’re under the big oak because we’re passin‘ through a cool spot.&#160;<br/>
Careful now, and don’t fall again.”<br/>
We had slowed to a cautious gait, and were feeling our way forward so as not to&#160;<br/>
bump into the tree. The tree was a single and ancient oak; two children could not&#160;<br/>
reach around its trunk and touch hands. It was far away from teachers, their spies,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=259></a>and curious neighbors: it was near the Radley lot, but the Radleys were not&#160;<br/>
curious. A small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many&#160;<br/>
fights and furtive crap games.<br/>
The lights in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance, but they&#160;<br/>
blinded us, if anything. “Don’t look ahead, Scout,” Jem said. “Look at the ground&#160;<br/>
and you won’t fall.”<br/>
“You should have brought the flashlight, Jem.”<br/>
“Didn’t know it was this dark. Didn’t look like it’d be this dark earlier in the&#160;<br/>
evening. So cloudy, that’s why. It’ll hold off a while, though.”<br/>
Someone leaped at us.<br/>
“God almighty!” Jem yelled.<br/>
A circle of light burst in our faces, and Cecil Jacobs jumped in glee behind it. “Ha-<br/>
a-a, gotcha!” he shrieked. “Thought you’d be comin‘ along this way!”<br/>
“What are you doin‘ way out here by yourself, boy? Ain’t you scared of Boo&#160;<br/>
Radley?”<br/>
Cecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parents, hadn’t seen us, then&#160;<br/>
had ventured down this far because he knew good and well we’d be coming&#160;<br/>
along. He thought Mr. Finch’d be with us, though.<br/>
“Shucks, ain’t much but around the corner,” said Jem. “Who’s scared to go&#160;<br/>
around the corner?” We had to admit that Cecil was pretty good, though. He&#160;<i>had</i>&#160;<br/>
given us a fright, and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse, that was his&#160;<br/>
privilege.<br/>
“Say,” I said, “ain’t you a cow tonight? Where’s your costume?”<br/>
“It’s up behind the stage,” he said. “Mrs. Merriweather says the pageant ain’t&#160;<br/>
comin‘ on for a while. You can put yours back of the stage by mine, Scout, and&#160;<br/>
we can go with the rest of ’em.”<br/>
This was an excellent idea, Jem thought. He also thought it a good thing that Cecil&#160;<br/>
and I would be together. This way, Jem would be left to go with people his own&#160;<br/>
age.<br/>
When we reached the auditorium, the whole town was there except Atticus and&#160;<br/>
the ladies worn out from decorating, and the usual outcasts and shut-ins. Most of&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=260></a>the county, it seemed, was there: the hall was teeming with slicked-up country&#160;<br/>
people. The high school building had a wide downstairs hallway; people milled&#160;<br/>
around booths that had been installed along each side.<br/>
“Oh Jem. I forgot my money,” I sighed, when I saw them.<br/>
“Atticus didn’t,” Jem said. “Here’s thirty cents, you can do six things. See you&#160;<br/>
later on.”<br/>
“Okay,” I said, quite content with thirty cents and Cecil. I went with Cecil down&#160;<br/>
to the front of the auditorium, through a door on one side, and backstage. I got rid&#160;<br/>
of my ham costume and departed in a hurry, for Mrs. Merriweather was standing&#160;<br/>
at a lectern in front of the first row of seats making last-minute, frenzied changes&#160;<br/>
in the script.<br/>
“How much money you got?” I asked Cecil. Cecil had thirty cents, too, which&#160;<br/>
made us even. We squandered our first nickels on the House of Horrors, which&#160;<br/>
scared us not at all; we entered the black seventh-grade room and were led around&#160;<br/>
by the temporary ghoul in residence and were made to touch several objects&#160;<br/>
alleged to be component parts of a human being. “Here’s his eyes,” we were told&#160;<br/>
when we touched two peeled grapes on a saucer. “Here’s his heart,” which felt&#160;<br/>
like raw liver. “These are his innards,” and our hands were thrust into a plate of&#160;<br/>
cold spaghetti.<br/>
Cecil and I visited several booths. We each bought a sack of Mrs. Judge Taylor’s&#160;<br/>
homemade divinity. I wanted to bob for apples, but Cecil said it wasn’t sanitary.&#160;<br/>
His mother said he might catch something from everybody’s heads having been in&#160;<br/>
the same tub. “Ain’t anything around town now to catch,” I protested. But Cecil&#160;<br/>
said his mother said it was unsanitary to eat after folks. I later asked Aunt&#160;<br/>
Alexandra about this, and she said people who held such views were usually&#160;<br/>
climbers.<br/>
We were about to purchase a blob of taffy when Mrs. Merriweather’s runners&#160;<br/>
appeared and told us to go backstage, it was time to get ready. The auditorium&#160;<br/>
was filling with people; the Maycomb County High School band had assembled&#160;<br/>
in front below the stage; the stage footlights were on and the red velvet curtain&#160;<br/>
rippled and billowed from the scurrying going on behind it.<br/>
Backstage, Cecil and I found the narrow hallway teeming with people: adults in&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=261></a>homemade three-corner hats, Confederate caps, Spanish-American War hats, and&#160;<br/>
World War helmets. Children dressed as various agricultural enterprises crowded&#160;<br/>
around the one small window.<br/>
“Somebody’s mashed my costume,” I wailed in dismay. Mrs. Merriweather&#160;<br/>
galloped to me, reshaped the chicken wire, and thrust me inside.<br/>
“You all right in there, Scout?” asked Cecil. “You sound so far off, like you was&#160;<br/>
on the other side of a hill.”<br/>
“You don’t sound any nearer,” I said.<br/>
The band played the national anthem, and we heard the audience rise. Then the&#160;<br/>
bass drum sounded. Mrs. Merriweather, stationed behind her lectern beside the&#160;<br/>
band, said: “Maycomb County Ad Astra Per Aspera.” The bass drum boomed&#160;<br/>
again. “That means,” said Mrs. Merriweather, translating for the rustic elements,&#160;<br/>
“from the mud to the stars.” She added, unnecessarily, it seemed to me, “A&#160;<br/>
pageant.”<br/>
“Reckon they wouldn’t know what it was if she didn’t tell ‘em,” whispered Cecil,&#160;<br/>
who was immediately shushed.<br/>
“The whole town knows it,” I breathed.<br/>
“But the country folks’ve come in,” Cecil said.<br/>
“Be quiet back there,” a man’s voice ordered, and we were silent.<br/>
The bass drum went boom with every sentence Mrs. Merriweather uttered. She&#160;<br/>
chanted mournfully about Maycomb County being older than the state, that it was&#160;<br/>
a part of the Mississippi and Alabama Territories, that the first white man to set&#160;<br/>
foot in the virgin forests was the Probate Judge’s great-grandfather five times&#160;<br/>
removed, who was never heard of again. Then came the fearless Colonel&#160;<br/>
Maycomb, for whom the county was named.<br/>
Andrew Jackson appointed him to a position of authority, and Colonel&#160;<br/>
Maycomb’s misplaced self-confidence and slender sense of direction brought&#160;<br/>
disaster to all who rode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. Colonel Maycomb&#160;<br/>
persevered in his efforts to make the region safe for democracy, but his first&#160;<br/>
campaign was his last. His orders, relayed to him by a friendly Indian runner,&#160;<br/>
were to move south. After consulting a tree to ascertain from its lichen which way&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=262></a>was south, and taking no lip from the subordinates who ventured to correct him,&#160;<br/>
Colonel Maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to rout the enemy and&#160;<br/>
entangled his troops so far northwest in the forest primeval that they were&#160;<br/>
eventually rescued by settlers moving inland.<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather gave a thirty-minute description of Colonel Maycomb’s&#160;<br/>
exploits. I discovered that if I bent my knees I could tuck them under my costume&#160;<br/>
and more or less sit. I sat down, listened to Mrs. Merriweather’s drone and the&#160;<br/>
bass drum’s boom and was soon fast asleep.<br/>
They said later that Mrs. Merriweather was putting her all into the grand finale,&#160;<br/>
that she had crooned, “Po-ork,” with a confidence born of pine trees and&#160;<br/>
butterbeans entering on cue. She waited a few seconds, then called, “Po-ork?”&#160;<br/>
When nothing materialized, she yelled, “Pork!”<br/>
I must have heard her in my sleep, or the band playing Dixie woke me, but it was&#160;<br/>
when Mrs. Merriweather triumphantly mounted the stage with the state flag that I&#160;<br/>
chose to make my entrance. Chose is incorrect: I thought I’d better catch up with&#160;<br/>
the rest of them.<br/>
They told me later that Judge Taylor went out behind the auditorium and stood&#160;<br/>
there slapping his knees so hard Mrs. Taylor brought him a glass of water and one&#160;<br/>
of his pills.<br/>
Mrs. Merriweather seemed to have a hit, everybody was cheering so, but she&#160;<br/>
caught me backstage and told me I had ruined her pageant. She made me feel&#160;<br/>
awful, but when Jem came to fetch me he was sympathetic. He said he couldn’t&#160;<br/>
see my costume much from where he was sitting. How he could tell I was feeling&#160;<br/>
bad under my costume I don’t know, but he said I did all right, I just came in a&#160;<br/>
little late, that was all. Jem was becoming almost as good as Atticus at making&#160;<br/>
you feel right when things went wrong. Almost—not even Jem could make me go&#160;<br/>
through that crowd, and he consented to wait backstage with me until the&#160;<br/>
audience left.<br/>
“You wanta take it off, Scout?” he asked.<br/>
“Naw, I’ll just keep it on,” I said. I could hide my mortification under it.<br/>
“You all want a ride home?” someone asked.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=263></a>“No sir, thank you,” I heard Jem say. “It’s just a little walk.”<br/>
“Be careful of haints,” the voice said. “Better still, tell the haints to be careful of&#160;<br/>
Scout.”<br/>
“There aren’t many folks left now,” Jem told me. “Let’s go.”<br/>
We went through the auditorium to the hallway, then down the steps. It was still&#160;<br/>
black dark. The remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building, and&#160;<br/>
their headlights were little help. “If some of ‘em were goin’ in our direction we&#160;<br/>
could see better,” said Jem. “Here Scout, let me hold onto your—hock. You might&#160;<br/>
lose your balance.”<br/>
“I can see all right.”<br/>
“Yeah, but you might lose your balance.” I felt a slight pressure on my head, and&#160;<br/>
assumed that Jem had grabbed that end of the ham. “You got me?”<br/>
“Uh huh.”<br/>
We began crossing the black schoolyard, straining to see our feet. “Jem,” I said,&#160;<br/>
“I forgot my shoes, they’re back behind the stage.”<br/>
“Well let’s go get ‘em.” But as we turned around the auditorium lights went off.&#160;<br/>
“You can get ’em tomorrow,” he said.<br/>
“But tomorrow’s Sunday,” I protested, as Jem turned me homeward.<br/>
“You can get the Janitor to let you in… Scout?”<br/>
“Hm?”<br/>
“Nothing.”<br/>
Jem hadn’t started that in a long time. I wondered what he was thinking. He’d tell&#160;<br/>
me when he wanted to, probably when we got home. I felt his fingers press the&#160;<br/>
top of my costume, too hard, it seemed. I shook my head. “Jem, you don’t hafta<br/>
—”<br/>
“Hush a minute, Scout,” he said, pinching me.<br/>
We walked along silently. “Minute’s up,” I said. “Whatcha thinkin‘ about?” I&#160;<br/>
turned to look at him, but his outline was barely visible.<br/>
“Thought I heard something,” he said. “Stop a minute.”<br/>
We stopped.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=264></a>“Hear anything?” he asked.<br/>
“No.”<br/>
We had not gone five paces before he made me stop again.<br/>
“Jem, are you tryin‘ to scare me? You know I’m too old—”<br/>
“Be quiet,” he said, and I knew he was not joking.<br/>
The night was still. I could hear his breath coming easily beside me. Occasionally&#160;<br/>
there was a sudden breeze that hit my bare legs, but it was all that remained of a&#160;<br/>
promised windy night. This was the stillness before a thunderstorm. We listened.<br/>
“Heard an old dog just then,” I said.<br/>
“It’s not that,” Jem answered. “I hear it when we’re walkin‘ along, but when we&#160;<br/>
stop I don’t hear it.”<br/>
“You hear my costume rustlin‘. Aw, it’s just Halloween got you…”<br/>
I said it more to convince myself than Jem, for sure enough, as we began walking,&#160;<br/>
I heard what he was talking about. It was not my costume.<br/>
“It’s just old Cecil,” said Jem presently. “He won’t get us again. Let’s don’t let&#160;<br/>
him think we’re hurrying.”<br/>
We slowed to a crawl. I asked Jem how Cecil could follow us in this dark, looked&#160;<br/>
to me like he’d bump into us from behind.<br/>
“I can see you, Scout,” Jem said.<br/>
“How? I can’t see you.”<br/>
“Your fat streaks are showin‘. Mrs. Crenshaw painted ’em with some of that&#160;<br/>
shiny stuff so they’d show up under the footlights. I can see you pretty well, an‘ I&#160;<br/>
expect Cecil can see you well enough to keep his distance.”<br/>
I would show Cecil that we knew he was behind us and we were ready for him.&#160;<br/>
“Cecil Jacobs is a big wet he-en!” I yelled suddenly, turning around.<br/>
We stopped. There was no acknowledgement save he-en bouncing off the distant&#160;<br/>
schoolhouse wall.<br/>
“I’ll get him,” said Jem. “He-y!”<br/>
Hay-e-hay-e-hay-ey, answered the schoolhouse wall. It was unlike Cecil to hold&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=265></a>out for so long; once he pulled a joke he’d repeat it time and again. We should&#160;<br/>
have been leapt at already. Jem signaled for me to stop again.<br/>
He said softly, “Scout, can you take that thing off?”<br/>
“I think so, but I ain’t got anything on under it much.”<br/>
“I’ve got your dress here.”<br/>
“I can’t get it on in the dark.”<br/>
“Okay,” he said, “never mind.”<br/>
“Jem, are you afraid?”<br/>
“No. Think we’re almost to the tree now. Few yards from that, an‘ we’ll be to the&#160;<br/>
road. We can see the street light then.” Jem was talking in an unhurried, flat&#160;<br/>
toneless voice. I wondered how long he would try to keep the Cecil myth going.<br/>
“You reckon we oughta sing, Jem?”<br/>
“No. Be real quiet again, Scout.”<br/>
We had not increased our pace. Jem knew as well as I that it was difficult to walk&#160;<br/>
fast without stumping a toe, tripping on stones, and other inconveniences, and I&#160;<br/>
was barefooted. Maybe it was the wind rustling the trees. But there wasn’t any&#160;<br/>
wind and there weren’t any trees except the big oak.<br/>
Our company shuffled and dragged his feet, as if wearing heavy shoes. Whoever&#160;<br/>
it was wore thick cotton pants; what I thought were trees rustling was the soft&#160;<br/>
swish of cotton on cotton, wheek, wheek, with every step.<br/>
I felt the sand go cold under my feet and I knew we were near the big oak. Jem&#160;<br/>
pressed my head. We stopped and listened.<br/>
Shuffle-foot had not stopped with us this time. His trousers swished softly and&#160;<br/>
steadily. Then they stopped. He was running, running toward us with no child’s&#160;<br/>
steps.<br/>
“Run, Scout! Run! Run!” Jem screamed.<br/>
I took one giant step and found myself reeling: my arms useless, in the dark, I&#160;<br/>
could not keep my balance.<br/>
“Jem, Jem, help me, Jem!”<br/>
Something crushed the chicken wire around me. Metal ripped on metal and I fell&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=266></a>to the ground and rolled as far as I could, floundering to escape my wire prison.&#160;<br/>
From somewhere near by came scuffling, kicking sounds, sounds of shoes and&#160;<br/>
flesh scraping dirt and roots. Someone rolled against me and I felt Jem. He was up&#160;<br/>
like lightning and pulling me with him but, though my head and shoulders were&#160;<br/>
free, I was so entangled we didn’t get very far.<br/>
We were nearly to the road when I felt Jem’s hand leave me, felt him jerk&#160;<br/>
backwards to the ground. More scuffling, and there came a dull crunching sound&#160;<br/>
and Jem screamed.<br/>
I ran in the direction of Jem’s scream and sank into a flabby male stomach. Its&#160;<br/>
owner said, “Uff!” and tried to catch my arms, but they were tightly pinioned. His&#160;<br/>
stomach was soft but his arms were like steel. He slowly squeezed the breath out&#160;<br/>
of me. I could not move. Suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the&#160;<br/>
ground, almost carrying me with him. I thought, Jem’s up.<br/>
One’s mind works very slowly at times. Stunned, I stood there dumbly. The&#160;<br/>
scuffling noises were dying; someone wheezed and the night was still again.<br/>
Still but for a man breathing heavily, breathing heavily and staggering. I thought&#160;<br/>
he went to the tree and leaned against it. He coughed violently, a sobbing, bone-<br/>
shaking cough.<br/>
“Jem?”<br/>
There was no answer but the man’s heavy breathing.<br/>
“Jem?”<br/>
Jem didn’t answer.<br/>
The man began moving around, as if searching for something. I heard him groan&#160;<br/>
and pull something heavy along the ground. It was slowly coming to me that there&#160;<br/>
were now four people under the tree.<br/>
“Atticus…?”<br/>
The man was walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road.<br/>
I went to where I thought he had been and felt frantically along the ground,&#160;<br/>
reaching out with my toes. Presently I touched someone.<br/>
“Jem?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=267></a>My toes touched trousers, a belt buckle, buttons, something I could not identify, a&#160;<br/>
collar, and a face. A prickly stubble on the face told me it was not Jem’s. I&#160;<br/>
smelled stale whiskey.<br/>
I made my way along in what I thought was the direction of the road. I was not&#160;<br/>
sure, because I had been turned around so many times. But I found it and looked&#160;<br/>
down to the street light. A man was passing under it. The man was walking with&#160;<br/>
the staccato steps of someone carrying a load too heavy for him. He was going&#160;<br/>
around the corner. He was carrying Jem. Jem’s arm was dangling crazily in front&#160;<br/>
of him.<br/>
By the time I reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard. Light from&#160;<br/>
our front door framed Atticus for an instant; he ran down the steps, and together,&#160;<br/>
he and the man took Jem inside.<br/>
I was at the front door when they were going down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was&#160;<br/>
running to meet me. “Call Dr. Reynolds!” Atticus’s voice came sharply from&#160;<br/>
Jem’s room. “Where’s Scout?”<br/>
“Here she is,” Aunt Alexandra called, pulling me along with her to the telephone.&#160;<br/>
She tugged at me anxiously. “I’m all right, Aunty,” I said, “you better call.”<br/>
She pulled the receiver from the hook and said, “Eula May, get Dr. Reynolds,&#160;<br/>
quick!”<br/>
“Agnes, is your father home? Oh God, where is he? Please tell him to come over&#160;<br/>
here as soon as he comes in. Please, it’s urgent!”<br/>
There was no need for Aunt Alexandra to identify herself, people in Maycomb&#160;<br/>
knew each other’s voices.<br/>
Atticus came out of Jem’s room. The moment Aunt Alexandra broke the&#160;<br/>
connection, Atticus took the receiver from her. He rattled the hook, then said,&#160;<br/>
“Eula May, get me the sheriff, please.”<br/>
“Heck? Atticus Finch. Someone’s been after my children. Jem’s hurt. Between&#160;<br/>
here and the schoolhouse. I can’t leave my boy. Run out there for me, please, and&#160;<br/>
see if he’s still around. Doubt if you’ll find him now, but I’d like to see him if you&#160;<br/>
do. Got to go now. Thanks, Heck.”<br/>
“Atticus, is Jem dead?”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=268></a>“No, Scout. Look after her, sister,” he called, as he went down the hall.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra’s fingers trembled as she unwound the crushed fabric and wire&#160;<br/>
from around me. “Are you all right, darling?” she asked over and over as she&#160;<br/>
worked me free.<br/>
It was a relief to be out. My arms were beginning to tingle, and they were red with&#160;<br/>
small hexagonal marks. I rubbed them, and they felt better.<br/>
“Aunty, is Jem dead?”<br/>
“No—no, darling, he’s unconscious. We won’t know how badly he’s hurt until&#160;<br/>
Dr. Reynolds gets here. Jean Louise, what happened?”<br/>
“I don’t know.”<br/>
She left it at that. She brought me something to put on, and had I thought about it&#160;<br/>
then, I would have never let her forget it: in her distraction, Aunty brought me my&#160;<br/>
overalls. “Put these on, darling,” she said, handing me the garments she most&#160;<br/>
despised.<br/>
She rushed back to Jem’s room, then came to me in the hall. She patted me&#160;<br/>
vaguely, and went back to Jem’s room.<br/>
A car stopped in front of the house. I knew Dr. Reynolds’s step almost as well as&#160;<br/>
my father’s. He had brought Jem and me into the world, had led us through every&#160;<br/>
childhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the treehouse,&#160;<br/>
and he had never lost our friendship. Dr. Reynolds said if we had been boil-prone&#160;<br/>
things would have been different, but we doubted it.<br/>
He came in the door and said, “Good Lord.” He walked toward me, said, “You’re&#160;<br/>
still standing,” and changed his course. He knew every room in the house. He also&#160;<br/>
knew that if I was in bad shape, so was Jem.<br/>
After ten forevers Dr. Reynolds returned. “Is Jem dead?” I asked.<br/>
“Far from it,” he said, squatting down to me. “He’s got a bump on the head just&#160;<br/>
like yours, and a broken arm. Scout, look that way—no, don’t turn your head, roll&#160;<br/>
your eyes. Now look over yonder. He’s got a bad break, so far as I can tell now&#160;<br/>
it’s in the elbow. Like somebody tried to wring his arm off… Now look at me.”<br/>
“Then he’s not dead?”<br/>
“No-o!” Dr. Reynolds got to his feet. “We can’t do much tonight,” he said,&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=269></a>“except try to make him as comfortable as we can. We’ll have to X-ray his arm—<br/>
looks like he’ll be wearing his arm ‘way out by his side for a while. Don’t worry,&#160;<br/>
though, he’ll be as good as new. Boys his age bounce.”<br/>
While he was talking, Dr. Reynolds had been looking keenly at me, lightly&#160;<br/>
fingering the bump that was coming on my forehead. “You don’t feel broke&#160;<br/>
anywhere, do you?”<br/>
Dr. Reynolds’s small joke made me smile. “Then you don’t think he’s dead,&#160;<br/>
then?”<br/>
He put on his hat. “Now I may be wrong, of course, but I think he’s very alive.&#160;<br/>
Shows all the symptoms of it. Go have a look at him, and when I come back we’ll&#160;<br/>
get together and decide.”<br/>
Dr. Reynolds’s step was young and brisk. Mr. Heck Tate’s was not. His heavy&#160;<br/>
boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly, but he said the same&#160;<br/>
thing Dr. Reynolds said when he came in. “You all right, Scout?” he added.<br/>
“Yes sir, I’m goin‘ in to see Jem. Atticus’n’them’s in there.”<br/>
“I’ll go with you,” said Mr. Tate.<br/>
Aunt Alexandra had shaded Jem’s reading light with a towel, and his room was&#160;<br/>
dim. Jem was lying on his back. There was an ugly mark along one side of his&#160;<br/>
face. His left arm lay out from his body; his elbow was bent slightly, but in the&#160;<br/>
wrong direction. Jem was frowning.<br/>
“Jem…?”<br/>
Atticus spoke. “He can’t hear you, Scout, he’s out like a light. He was coming&#160;<br/>
around, but Dr. Reynolds put him out again.”<br/>
“Yes sir.” I retreated. Jem’s room was large and square. Aunt Alexandra was&#160;<br/>
sitting in a rocking-chair by the fireplace. The man who brought Jem in was&#160;<br/>
standing in a corner, leaning against the wall. He was some countryman I did not&#160;<br/>
know. He had probably been at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it&#160;<br/>
happened. He must have heard our screams and come running.<br/>
Atticus was standing by Jem’s bed.<br/>
Mr. Heck Tate stood in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and a flashlight&#160;<br/>
bulged from his pants pocket. He was in his working clothes.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=270></a>“Come in, Heck,” said Atticus. “Did you find anything? I can’t conceive of&#160;<br/>
anyone low-down enough to do a thing like this, but I hope you found him.”<br/>
Mr. Tate sniffed. He glanced sharply at the man in the corner, nodded to him, then&#160;<br/>
looked around the room—at Jem, at Aunt Alexandra, then at Atticus.<br/>
“Sit down, Mr. Finch,” he said pleasantly.<br/>
Atticus said, “Let’s all sit down. Have that chair, Heck. I’ll get another one from&#160;<br/>
the livingroom.”<br/>
Mr. Tate sat in Jem’s desk chair. He waited until Atticus returned and settled&#160;<br/>
himself. I wondered why Atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the&#160;<br/>
corner, but Atticus knew the ways of country people far better than I. Some of his&#160;<br/>
rural clients would park their long-eared steeds under the chinaberry trees in the&#160;<br/>
back yard, and Atticus would often keep appointments on the back steps. This one&#160;<br/>
was probably more comfortable where he was.<br/>
“Mr. Finch,” said Mr. Tate, “tell you what I found. I found a little girl’s dress—<br/>
it’s out there in my car. That your dress, Scout?”<br/>
“Yes sir, if it’s a pink one with smockin‘,” I said. Mr. Tate was behaving as if he&#160;<br/>
were on the witness stand. He liked to tell things his own way, untrammeled by&#160;<br/>
state or defense, and sometimes it took him a while.<br/>
“I found some funny-looking pieces of muddy-colored cloth—”<br/>
“That’s m’costume, Mr. Tate.”<br/>
Mr. Tate ran his hands down his thighs. He rubbed his left arm and investigated&#160;<br/>
Jem’s mantelpiece, then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace. His fingers&#160;<br/>
sought his long nose.<br/>
“What is it, Heck?” said Atticus.<br/>
Mr. Tate found his neck and rubbed it. “Bob Ewell’s lyin‘ on the ground under&#160;<br/>
that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs. He’s dead, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Finch.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=271></a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#1">Contents&#160;-&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#257">Prev&#160;/&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#275">Next</a><br/>
<b>Chapter 29</b><br/>
Aunt Alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece. Mr. Tate rose, but she&#160;<br/>
declined assistance. For once in his life, Atticus’s instinctive courtesy failed him:&#160;<br/>
he sat where he was.<br/>
Somehow, I could think of nothing but Mr. Bob Ewell saying he’d get Atticus if it&#160;<br/>
took him the rest of his life. Mr. Ewell almost got him, and it was the last thing he&#160;<br/>
did.<br/>
“Are you sure?” Atticus said bleakly.<br/>
“He’s dead all right,” said Mr. Tate. “He’s good and dead. He won’t hurt these&#160;<br/>
children again.”<br/>
“I didn’t mean that.” Atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep. His age was&#160;<br/>
beginning to show, his one sign of inner turmoil, the strong line of his jaw melted&#160;<br/>
a little, one became aware of telltale creases forming under his ears, one noticed&#160;<br/>
not his jet-black hair but the gray patches growing at his temples.<br/>
“Hadn’t we better go to the livingroom?” Aunt Alexandra said at last.<br/>
“If you don’t mind,” said Mr. Tate, “I’d rather us stay in here if it won’t hurt Jem&#160;<br/>
any. I want to have a look at his injuries while Scout… tells us about it.”<br/>
“Is it all right if I leave?” she asked. “I’m just one person too many in here. I’ll be&#160;<br/>
in my room if you want me, Atticus.” Aunt Alexandra went to the door, but she&#160;<br/>
stopped and turned. “Atticus, I had a feeling about this tonight—I—this is my&#160;<br/>
fault,” she began. “I should have—”<br/>
Mr. Tate held up his hand. “You go ahead, Miss Alexandra, I know it’s been a&#160;<br/>
shock to you. And don’t you fret yourself about anything—why, if we followed&#160;<br/>
our feelings all the time we’d be like cats chasin‘ their tails. Miss Scout, see if&#160;<br/>
you can tell us what happened, while it’s still fresh in your mind. You think you&#160;<br/>
can? Did you see him following you?”<br/>
I went to Atticus and felt his arms go around me. I buried my head in his lap. “We&#160;<br/>
started home. I said Jem, I’ve forgot m’shoes. Soon’s we started back for ‘em the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=272></a>lights went out. Jem said I could get ’em tomorrow…”<br/>
“Scout, raise up so Mr. Tate can hear you,” Atticus said. I crawled into his lap.<br/>
“Then Jem said hush a minute. I thought he was thinkin‘—he always wants you to&#160;<br/>
hush so he can think—then he said he heard somethin’. We thought it was Cecil.”<br/>
“Cecil?”<br/>
“Cecil Jacobs. He scared us once tonight, an‘ we thought it was him again. He&#160;<br/>
had on a sheet. They gave a quarter for the best costume, I don’t know who won it<br/>
—”<br/>
“Where were you when you thought it was Cecil?”<br/>
“Just a little piece from the schoolhouse. I yelled somethin‘ at him—”<br/>
“You yelled, what?”<br/>
“Cecil Jacobs is a big fat hen, I think. We didn’t hear nothin‘—then Jem yelled&#160;<br/>
hello or somethin’ loud enough to wake the dead—”<br/>
“Just a minute, Scout,” said Mr. Tate. “Mr. Finch, did you hear them?”<br/>
Atticus said he didn’t. He had the radio on. Aunt Alexandra had hers going in her&#160;<br/>
bedroom. He remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she&#160;<br/>
could hear hers. Atticus smiled. “I always play a radio too loud.”<br/>
“I wonder if the neighbors heard anything…” said Mr. Tate.<br/>
“I doubt it, Heck. Most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the&#160;<br/>
chickens. Maudie Atkinson may have been up, but I doubt it.”<br/>
“Go ahead, Scout,” Mr. Tate said.<br/>
“Well, after Jem yelled we walked on. Mr. Tate, I was shut up in my costume but&#160;<br/>
I could hear it myself, then. Footsteps, I mean. They walked when we walked and&#160;<br/>
stopped when we stopped. Jem said he could see me because Mrs. Crenshaw put&#160;<br/>
some kind of shiny paint on my costume. I was a ham.”<br/>
“How’s that?” asked Mr. Tate, startled.<br/>
Atticus described my role to Mr. Tate, plus the construction of my garment. “You&#160;<br/>
should have seen her when she came in,” he said, “it was crushed to a pulp.”<br/>
Mr. Tate rubbed his chin. “I wondered why he had those marks on him, His&#160;<br/>
sleeves were perforated with little holes. There were one or two little puncture&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=273></a>marks on his arms to match the holes. Let me see that thing if you will, sir.”<br/>
Atticus fetched the remains of my costume. Mr. Tate turned it over and bent it&#160;<br/>
around to get an idea of its former shape. “This thing probably saved her life,” he&#160;<br/>
said. “Look.”<br/>
He pointed with a long forefinger. A shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire.&#160;<br/>
“Bob Ewell meant business,” Mr. Tate muttered.<br/>
“He was out of his mind,” said Atticus.<br/>
“Don’t like to contradict you, Mr. Finch—wasn’t crazy, mean as hell. Low-down&#160;<br/>
skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children. He’d&#160;<br/>
never have met you face to face.”<br/>
Atticus shook his head. “I can’t conceive of a man who’d—”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, there’s just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say&#160;<br/>
hidy to ‘em. Even then, they ain’t worth the bullet it takes to shoot ’em. Ewell ‘as&#160;<br/>
one of ’em.”<br/>
Atticus said, “I thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me. Even if&#160;<br/>
he hadn’t, I thought he’d come after me.”<br/>
“He had guts enough to pester a poor colored woman, he had guts enough to&#160;<br/>
pester Judge Taylor when he thought the house was empty, so do you think he’da&#160;<br/>
met you to your face in daylight?” Mr. Tate sighed. “We’d better get on. Scout,&#160;<br/>
you heard him behind you—”<br/>
“Yes sir. When we got under the tree—”<br/>
“How’d you know you were under the tree, you couldn’t see thunder out there.”<br/>
“I was barefooted, and Jem says the ground’s always cooler under a tree.”<br/>
“We’ll have to make him a deputy, go ahead.”<br/>
“Then all of a sudden somethin‘ grabbed me an’ mashed my costume… think I&#160;<br/>
ducked on the ground… heard a tusslin‘ under the tree sort of… they were&#160;<br/>
bammin’ against the trunk, sounded like. Jem found me and started pullin‘ me&#160;<br/>
toward the road. Some—Mr. Ewell yanked him down, I reckon. They tussled&#160;<br/>
some more and then there was this funny noise—Jem hollered…” I stopped. That&#160;<br/>
was Jem’s arm.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=274></a>“Anyway, Jem hollered and I didn’t hear him any more an‘ the next thing—Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ewell was tryin’ to squeeze me to death, I reckon… then somebody yanked Mr.&#160;<br/>
Ewell down. Jem must have got up, I guess. That’s all I know…”<br/>
“And then?” Mr. Tate was looking at me sharply.<br/>
“Somebody was staggerin‘ around and pantin’ and—coughing fit to die. I thought&#160;<br/>
it was Jem at first, but it didn’t sound like him, so I went lookin‘ for Jem on the&#160;<br/>
ground. I thought Atticus had come to help us and had got wore out—”<br/>
“Who was it?”<br/>
“Why there he is, Mr. Tate, he can tell you his name.”<br/>
As I said it, I half pointed to the man in the corner, but brought my arm down&#160;<br/>
quickly lest Atticus reprimand me for pointing. It was impolite to point.<br/>
He was still leaning against the wall. He had been leaning against the wall when I&#160;<br/>
came into the room, his arms folded across his chest. As I pointed he brought his&#160;<br/>
arms down and pressed the palms of his hands against the wall. They were white&#160;<br/>
hands, sickly white hands that had never seen the sun, so white they stood out&#160;<br/>
garishly against the dull cream wall in the dim light of Jem’s room.<br/>
I looked from his hands to his sand-stained khaki pants; my eyes traveled up his&#160;<br/>
thin frame to his torn denim shirt. His face was as white as his hands, but for a&#160;<br/>
shadow on his jutting chin. His cheeks were thin to hollowness; his mouth was&#160;<br/>
wide; there were shallow, almost delicate indentations at his temples, and his gray&#160;<br/>
eyes were so colorless I thought he was blind. His hair was dead and thin, almost&#160;<br/>
feathery on top of his head.<br/>
When I pointed to him his palms slipped slightly, leaving greasy sweat streaks on&#160;<br/>
the wall, and he hooked his thumbs in his belt. A strange small spasm shook him,&#160;<br/>
as if he heard fingernails scrape slate, but as I gazed at him in wonder the tension&#160;<br/>
slowly drained from his face. His lips parted into a timid smile, and our&#160;<br/>
neighbor’s image blurred with my sudden tears.<br/>
“Hey, Boo,” I said.<br/>
<hr/>

<b>Chapter 30</b><br/>
“Mr. Arthur, honey,” said Atticus, gently correcting me. “Jean Louise, this is Mr.&#160;<br/>
Arthur Radley. I believe he already knows you.”<br/>
If Atticus could blandly introduce me to Boo Radley at a time like this, well—that&#160;<br/>
was Atticus.<br/>
Boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where Jem was sleeping, for the same shy&#160;<br/>
smile crept across his face. Hot with embarrassment, I tried to cover up by&#160;<br/>
covering Jem up.<br/>
“Ah-ah, don’t touch him,” Atticus said.<br/>
Mr. Heck Tate sat looking intently at Boo through his horn-rimmed glasses. He&#160;<br/>
was about to speak when Dr. Reynolds came down the hall.<br/>
“Everybody out,” he said, as he came in the door. “Evenin‘, Arthur, didn’t notice&#160;<br/>
you the first time I was here.”<br/>
Dr. Reynolds’s voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said it every&#160;<br/>
evening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even more than being in&#160;<br/>
the same room with Boo Radley. Of course… even Boo Radley got sick&#160;<br/>
sometimes, I thought. But on the other hand I wasn’t sure.<br/>
Dr. Reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper. He put it down&#160;<br/>
on Jem’s desk and took off his coat. “You’re quite satisfied he’s alive, now? Tell&#160;<br/>
you how I knew. When I tried to examine him he kicked me. Had to put him out&#160;<br/>
good and proper to touch him. So scat,” he said to me.<br/>
“Er—” said Atticus, glancing at Boo. “Heck, let’s go out on the front porch.&#160;<br/>
There are plenty of chairs out there, and it’s still warm enough.”<br/>
I wondered why Atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the&#160;<br/>
livingroom, then I understood. The livingroom lights were awfully strong.<br/>
We filed out, first Mr. Tate—Atticus was waiting at the door for him to go ahead&#160;<br/>
of him. Then he changed his mind and followed Mr. Tate.<br/>
People have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions. I&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=276></a>was no exception: “Come along, Mr. Arthur,” I heard myself saying, “you don’t&#160;<br/>
know the house real well. I’ll just take you to the porch, sir.”<br/>
He looked down at me and nodded.<br/>
I led him through the hall and past the livingroom.<br/>
“Won’t you have a seat, Mr. Arthur? This rocking-chair’s nice and comfortable.”<br/>
My small fantasy about him was alive again: he would be sitting on the porch…&#160;<br/>
right pretty spell we’re having, isn’t it, Mr. Arthur?<br/>
Yes, a right pretty spell. Feeling slightly unreal, I led him to the chair farthest&#160;<br/>
from Atticus and Mr. Tate. It was in deep shadow. Boo would feel more&#160;<br/>
comfortable in the dark.<br/>
Atticus was sitting in the swing, and Mr. Tate was in a chair next to him. The&#160;<br/>
light from the livingroom windows was strong on them. I sat beside Boo.<br/>
“Well, Heck,” Atticus was saying, “I guess the thing to do—good Lord, I’m&#160;<br/>
losing my memory…” Atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his&#160;<br/>
eyes. “Jem’s not quite thirteen… no, he’s already thirteen—I can’t remember.&#160;<br/>
Anyway, it’ll come before county court—”<br/>
“What will, Mr. Finch?” Mr. Tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward.<br/>
“Of course it was clear-cut self defense, but I’ll have to go to the office and hunt&#160;<br/>
up—”<br/>
“Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell? Do you think that?”<br/>
“You heard what Scout said, there’s no doubt about it. She said Jem got up and&#160;<br/>
yanked him off her—he probably got hold of Ewell’s knife somehow in the&#160;<br/>
dark… we’ll find out tomorrow.”<br/>
“Mis-ter Finch, hold on,” said Mr. Tate. “Jem never stabbed Bob Ewell.”<br/>
Atticus was silent for a moment. He looked at Mr. Tate as if he appreciated what&#160;<br/>
he said. But Atticus shook his head.<br/>
“Heck, it’s mighty kind of you and I know you’re doing it from that good heart of&#160;<br/>
yours, but don’t start anything like that.”<br/>
Mr. Tate got up and went to the edge of the porch. He spat into the shrubbery,&#160;<br/>
then thrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced Atticus. “Like what?” he said.<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=277></a>“I’m sorry if I spoke sharply, Heck,” Atticus said simply, “but nobody’s hushing&#160;<br/>
this up. I don’t live that way.”<br/>
“Nobody’s gonna hush anything up, Mr. Finch.”<br/>
Mr. Tate’s voice was quiet, but his boots were planted so solidly on the porch&#160;<br/>
floorboards it seemed that they grew there. A curious contest, the nature of which&#160;<br/>
eluded me, was developing between my father and the sheriff.<br/>
It was Atticus’s turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch. He said, “H’rm,”&#160;<br/>
and spat dryly into the yard. He put his hands in his pockets and faced Mr. Tate.<br/>
“Heck, you haven’t said it, but I know what you’re thinking. Thank you for it.&#160;<br/>
Jean Louise—” he turned to me. “You said Jem yanked Mr. Ewell off you?”<br/>
“Yes sir, that’s what I thought… I—”<br/>
“See there, Heck? Thank you from the bottom of my heart, but I don’t want my&#160;<br/>
boy starting out with something like this over his head. Best way to clear the air is&#160;<br/>
to have it all out in the open. Let the county come and bring sandwiches. I don’t&#160;<br/>
want him growing up with a whisper about him, I don’t want anybody saying,&#160;<br/>
‘Jem Finch… his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that.’ Sooner we get this&#160;<br/>
over with the better.”<br/>
“Mr. Finch,” Mr. Tate said stolidly, “Bob Ewell fell on his knife. He killed&#160;<br/>
himself.”<br/>
Atticus walked to the corner of the porch. He looked at the wisteria vine. In his&#160;<br/>
own way, I thought, each was as stubborn as the other. I wondered who would&#160;<br/>
give in first. Atticus’s stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident, but in some&#160;<br/>
ways he was as set as the Cunninghams. Mr. Tate’s was unschooled and blunt, but&#160;<br/>
it was equal to my father’s.<br/>
“Heck,” Atticus’s back was turned. “If this thing’s hushed up it’ll be a simple&#160;<br/>
denial to Jem of the way I’ve tried to raise him. Sometimes I think I’m a total&#160;<br/>
failure as a parent, but I’m all they’ve got. Before Jem looks at anyone else he&#160;<br/>
looks at me, and I’ve tried to live so I can look squarely back at him… if I&#160;<br/>
connived at something like this, frankly I couldn’t meet his eye, and the day I&#160;<br/>
can’t do that I’ll know I’ve lost him. I don’t want to lose him and Scout, because&#160;<br/>
they’re all I’ve got.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=278></a>“Mr. Finch.” Mr. Tate was still planted to the floorboards. “Bob Ewell fell on his&#160;<br/>
knife. I can prove it.”<br/>
Atticus wheeled around. His hands dug into his pockets. “Heck, can’t you even&#160;<br/>
try to see it my way? You’ve got children of your own, but I’m older than you.&#160;<br/>
When mine are grown I’ll be an old man if I’m still around, but right now I’m—if&#160;<br/>
they don’t trust me they won’t trust anybody. Jem and Scout know what&#160;<br/>
happened. If they hear of me saying downtown something different happened—<br/>
Heck, I won’t have them any more. I can’t live one way in town and another way&#160;<br/>
in my home.”<br/>
Mr. Tate rocked on his heels and said patiently, “He’d flung Jem down, he&#160;<br/>
stumbled over a root under that tree and—look, I can show you.”<br/>
Mr. Tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife. As he&#160;<br/>
did so, Dr. Reynolds came to the door. “The son—deceased’s under that tree,&#160;<br/>
doctor, just inside the schoolyard. Got a flashlight? Better have this one.”<br/>
“I can ease around and turn my car lights on,” said Dr. Reynolds, but he took Mr.&#160;<br/>
Tate’s flashlight. “Jem’s all right. He won’t wake up tonight, I hope, so don’t&#160;<br/>
worry. That the knife that killed him, Heck?”<br/>
“No sir, still in him. Looked like a kitchen knife from the handle. Ken oughta be&#160;<br/>
there with the hearse by now, doctor, ‘night.”<br/>
Mr. Tate flicked open the knife. “It was like this,” he said. He held the knife and&#160;<br/>
pretended to stumble; as he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of&#160;<br/>
him. “See there? Stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his ribs. His&#160;<br/>
whole weight drove it in.”<br/>
Mr. Tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket. “Scout is eight years&#160;<br/>
old,” he said. “She was too scared to know exactly what went on.”<br/>
“You’d be surprised,” Atticus said grimly.<br/>
“I’m not sayin‘ she made it up, I’m sayin’ she was too scared to know exactly&#160;<br/>
what happened. It was mighty dark out there, black as ink. ‘d take somebody&#160;<br/>
mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness…”<br/>
“I won’t have it,” Atticus said softly.<br/>
<i>“God damn it, I’m not thinking of Jem!”</i><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=279></a>Mr. Tate’s boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in Miss Maudie’s bedroom&#160;<br/>
went on. Miss Stephanie Crawford’s lights went on. Atticus and Mr. Tate looked&#160;<br/>
across the street, then at each other. They waited.<br/>
When Mr. Tate spoke again his voice was barely audible. “Mr. Finch, I hate to&#160;<br/>
fight you when you’re like this. You’ve been under a strain tonight no man should&#160;<br/>
ever have to go through. Why you ain’t in the bed from it I don’t know, but I do&#160;<br/>
know that for once you haven’t been able to put two and two together, and we’ve&#160;<br/>
got to settle this tonight because tomorrow’ll be too late. Bob Ewell’s got a&#160;<br/>
kitchen knife in his craw.”<br/>
Mr. Tate added that Atticus wasn’t going to stand there and maintain that any boy&#160;<br/>
Jem’s size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a&#160;<br/>
grown man in the pitch dark.<br/>
“Heck,” said Atticus abruptly, “that was a switchblade you were waving. Where’d&#160;<br/>
you get it?”<br/>
“Took it off a drunk man,” Mr. Tate answered coolly.<br/>
I was trying to remember. Mr. Ewell was on me… then he went down… Jem&#160;<br/>
must have gotten up. At least I thought…<br/>
“Heck?”<br/>
“I said I took it off a drunk man downtown tonight. Ewell probably found that&#160;<br/>
kitchen knife in the dump somewhere. Honed it down and bided his time… just&#160;<br/>
bided his time.”<br/>
Atticus made his way to the swing and sat down. His hands dangled limply&#160;<br/>
between his knees. He was looking at the floor. He had moved with the same&#160;<br/>
slowness that night in front of the jail, when I thought it took him forever to fold&#160;<br/>
his newspaper and toss it in his chair.<br/>
Mr. Tate clumped softly around the porch. “It ain’t your decision, Mr. Finch, it’s&#160;<br/>
all mine. It’s my decision and my responsibility. For once, if you don’t see it my&#160;<br/>
way, there’s not much you can do about it. If you wanta try, I’ll call you a liar to&#160;<br/>
your face. Your boy never stabbed Bob Ewell,” he said slowly, “didn’t come near&#160;<br/>
a mile of it and now you know it. All he wanted to do was get him and his sister&#160;<br/>
safely home.”<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=280></a>Mr. Tate stopped pacing. He stopped in front of Atticus, and his back was to us.&#160;<br/>
“I’m not a very good man, sir, but I am sheriff of Maycomb County. Lived in this&#160;<br/>
town all my life an‘ I’m goin’ on forty-three years old. Know everything that’s&#160;<br/>
happened here since before I was born. There’s a black boy dead for no reason,&#160;<br/>
and the man responsible for it’s dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Finch. Let the dead bury the dead.”<br/>
Mr. Tate went to the swing and picked up his hat. It was lying beside Atticus. Mr.&#160;<br/>
Tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on.<br/>
“I never heard tell that it’s against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent&#160;<br/>
a crime from being committed, which is exactly what he did, but maybe you’ll&#160;<br/>
say it’s my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up. Know what’d&#160;<br/>
happen then? All the ladies in Maycomb includin‘ my wife’d be knocking on his&#160;<br/>
door bringing angel food cakes. To my way of thinkin’, Mr. Finch, taking the one&#160;<br/>
man who’s done you and this town a great service an‘ draggin’ him with his shy&#160;<br/>
ways into the limelight—to me, that’s a sin. It’s a sin and I’m not about to have it&#160;<br/>
on my head. If it was any other man, it’d be different. But not this man, Mr.&#160;<br/>
Finch.”<br/>
Mr. Tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot. He pulled&#160;<br/>
his nose, then he massaged his left arm. “I may not be much, Mr. Finch, but I’m&#160;<br/>
still sheriff of Maycomb County and Bob Ewell fell on his knife. Good night, sir.”<br/>
Mr. Tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard. His car door&#160;<br/>
slammed and he drove away.<br/>
Atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time. Finally he raised his head.&#160;<br/>
“Scout,” he said, “Mr. Ewell fell on his knife. Can you possibly understand?”<br/>
Atticus looked like he needed cheering up. I ran to him and hugged him and&#160;<br/>
kissed him with all my might. “Yes sir, I understand,” I reassured him. “Mr. Tate&#160;<br/>
was right.”<br/>
Atticus disengaged himself and looked at me. “What do you mean?”<br/>
“Well, it’d be sort of like shootin‘ a mockingbird, wouldn’t it?”<br/>
Atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it. When he got up and walked across&#160;<br/>
the porch into the shadows, his youthful step had returned. Before he went inside&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=281></a>the house, he stopped in front of Boo Radley. “Thank you for my children,&#160;<br/>
Arthur,” he said.<br/>
<a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#1">Contents&#160;-&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#275">Prev&#160;/&#160;</a><a href="To-Kill-a-Mockingbird.pdf.html#285">Next</a><br/>
<b>Chapter 31</b><br/>
When Boo Radley shuffled to his feet, light from the livingroom windows&#160;<br/>
glistened on his forehead. Every move he made was uncertain, as if he were not&#160;<br/>
sure his hands and feet could make proper contact with the things he touched. He&#160;<br/>
coughed his dreadful raling cough, and was so shaken he had to sit down again.&#160;<br/>
His hand searched for his hip pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. He&#160;<br/>
coughed into it, then he wiped his forehead.<br/>
Having been so accustomed to his absence, I found it incredible that he had been&#160;<br/>
sitting beside me all this time, present. He had not made a sound.<br/>
Once more, he got to his feet. He turned to me and nodded toward the front door.<br/>
“You’d like to say good night to Jem, wouldn’t you, Mr. Arthur? Come right in.”<br/>
I led him down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was sitting by Jem’s bed. “Come in,&#160;<br/>
Arthur,” she said. “He’s still asleep. Dr. Reynolds gave him a heavy sedative.&#160;<br/>
Jean Louise, is your father in the livingroom?”<br/>
“Yes ma’am, I think so.”<br/>
“I’ll just go speak to him a minute. Dr. Reynolds left some…” her voice trailed&#160;<br/>
away.<br/>
Boo had drifted to a corner of the room, where he stood with his chin up, peering&#160;<br/>
from a distance at Jem. I took him by the hand, a hand surprisingly warm for its&#160;<br/>
whiteness. I tugged him a little, and he allowed me to lead him to Jem’s bed.<br/>
Dr. Reynolds had made a tent-like arrangement over Jem’s arm, to keep the cover&#160;<br/>
off, I guess, and Boo leaned forward and looked over it. An expression of timid&#160;<br/>
curiosity was on his face, as though he had never seen a boy before. His mouth&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=282></a>was slightly open, and he looked at Jem from head to foot. Boo’s hand came up,&#160;<br/>
but he let it drop to his side.<br/>
“You can pet him, Mr. Arthur, he’s asleep. You couldn’t if he was awake, though,&#160;<br/>
he wouldn’t let you…” I found myself explaining. “Go ahead.”<br/>
Boo’s hand hovered over Jem’s head.<br/>
“Go on, sir, he’s asleep.”<br/>
His hand came down lightly on Jem’s hair.<br/>
I was beginning to learn his body English. His hand tightened on mine and he&#160;<br/>
indicated that he wanted to leave.<br/>
I led him to the front porch, where his uneasy steps halted. He was still holding&#160;<br/>
my hand and he gave no sign of letting me go.<br/>
“Will you take me home?”<br/>
He almost whispered it, in the voice of a child afraid of the dark.<br/>
I put my foot on the top step and stopped. I would lead him through our house,&#160;<br/>
but I would never lead him home.<br/>
“Mr. Arthur, bend your arm down here, like that. That’s right, sir.”<br/>
I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm.<br/>
He had to stoop a little to accommodate me, but if Miss Stephanie Crawford was&#160;<br/>
watching from her upstairs window, she would see Arthur Radley escorting me&#160;<br/>
down the sidewalk, as any gentleman would do.<br/>
We came to the street light on the corner, and I wondered how many times Dill&#160;<br/>
had stood there hugging the fat pole, watching, waiting, hoping. I wondered how&#160;<br/>
many times Jem and I had made this journey, but I entered the Radley front gate&#160;<br/>
for the second time in my life. Boo and I walked up the steps to the porch. His&#160;<br/>
fingers found the front doorknob. He gently released my hand, opened the door,&#160;<br/>
went inside, and shut the door behind him. I never saw him again.<br/>
Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in&#160;<br/>
between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and&#160;<br/>
chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives. But neighbors give in return. We&#160;<br/>
never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=283></a>it made me sad.<br/>
I turned to go home. Street lights winked down the street all the way to town. I&#160;<br/>
had never seen our neighborhood from this angle. There were Miss Maudie’s,&#160;<br/>
Miss Stephanie’s—there was our house, I could see the porch swing—Miss&#160;<br/>
Rachel’s house was beyond us, plainly visible. I could even see Mrs. Dubose’s.<br/>
I looked behind me. To the left of the brown door was a long shuttered window. I&#160;<br/>
walked to it, stood in front of it, and turned around. In daylight, I thought, you&#160;<br/>
could see to the postoffice corner.<br/>
Daylight… in my mind, the night faded. It was daytime and the neighborhood&#160;<br/>
was busy. Miss Stephanie Crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to Miss&#160;<br/>
Rachel. Miss Maudie bent over her azaleas. It was summertime, and two children&#160;<br/>
scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance. The man&#160;<br/>
waved, and the children raced each other to him.<br/>
It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down the&#160;<br/>
sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands&#160;<br/>
on his hips. Summertime, and his children played in the front yard with their&#160;<br/>
friend, enacting a strange little drama of their own invention.<br/>
It was fall, and his children fought on the sidewalk in front of Mrs. Dubose’s. The&#160;<br/>
boy helped his sister to her feet, and they made their way home. Fall, and his&#160;<br/>
children trotted to and fro around the corner, the day’s woes and triumphs on their&#160;<br/>
faces. They stopped at an oak tree, delighted, puzzled, apprehensive.<br/>
Winter, and his children shivered at the front gate, silhouetted against a blazing&#160;<br/>
house. Winter, and a man walked into the street, dropped his glasses, and shot a&#160;<br/>
dog.<br/>
Summer, and he watched his children’s heart break. Autumn again, and Boo’s&#160;<br/>
children needed him.<br/>
Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand&#160;<br/>
in his shoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was&#160;<br/>
enough.<br/>
The street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. As I made my way&#160;<br/>
home, I felt very old, but when I looked at the tip of my nose I could see fine&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=284></a>misty beads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. As I made my way&#160;<br/>
home, I thought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. He’d be so mad he missed it&#160;<br/>
he wouldn’t speak to me for days. As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I&#160;<br/>
would get grown but there wasn’t much else left for us to learn, except possibly&#160;<br/>
algebra.<br/>
I ran up the steps and into the house. Aunt Alexandra had gone to bed, and&#160;<br/>
Atticus’s room was dark. I would see if Jem might be reviving. Atticus was in&#160;<br/>
Jem’s room, sitting by his bed. He was reading a book.<br/>
“Is Jem awake yet?”<br/>
“Sleeping peacefully. He won’t be awake until morning.”<br/>
“Oh. Are you sittin‘ up with him?”<br/>
“Just for an hour or so. Go to bed, Scout. You’ve had a long day.”<br/>
“Well, I think I’ll stay with you for a while.”<br/>
“Suit yourself,” said Atticus. It must have been after midnight, and I was puzzled&#160;<br/>
by his amiable acquiescence. He was shrewder than I, however: the moment I sat&#160;<br/>
down I began to feel sleepy.<br/>
“Whatcha readin‘?” I asked.<br/>
Atticus turned the book over. “Something of Jem’s. Called&#160;<i>The Gray Ghost</i>.”<br/>
I was suddenly awake. “Why’d you get that one?”<br/>
“Honey, I don’t know. Just picked it up. One of the few things I haven’t read,” he&#160;<br/>
said pointedly.<br/>
“Read it out loud, please, Atticus. It’s real scary.”<br/>
“No,” he said. “You’ve had enough scaring for a while. This is too—”<br/>
“Atticus, I wasn’t scared.”<br/>
He raised his eyebrows, and I protested: “Leastways not till I started telling Mr.&#160;<br/>
Tate about it. Jem wasn’t scared. Asked him and he said he wasn’t. Besides,&#160;<br/>
nothin’s real scary except in books.”<br/>
Atticus opened his mouth to say something, but shut it again. He took his thumb&#160;<br/>
from the middle of the book and turned back to the first page. I moved over and&#160;<br/>
leaned my head against his knee. “H’rm,” he said. “<i>The Gray Ghost</i>, by Seckatary&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=285></a>Hawkins. Chapter One…”<br/>
I willed myself to stay awake, but the rain was so soft and the room was so warm&#160;<br/>
and his voice was so deep and his knee was so snug that I slept.<br/>
Seconds later, it seemed, his shoe was gently nudging my ribs. He lifted me to my&#160;<br/>
feet and walked me to my room. “Heard every word you said,” I muttered. “…<br/>
wasn’t sleep at all, ‘s about a ship an’ Three-Fingered Fred ‘n’ Stoner’s Boy…”<br/>
He unhooked my overalls, leaned me against him, and pulled them off. He held&#160;<br/>
me up with one hand and reached for my pajamas with the other.<br/>
“Yeah, an‘ they all thought it was Stoner’s Boy messin’ up their clubhouse an‘&#160;<br/>
throwin’ ink all over it an‘…”<br/>
He guided me to the bed and sat me down. He lifted my legs and put me under the&#160;<br/>
cover.<br/>
“An‘ they chased him ’n‘ never could catch him ’cause they didn’t know what he&#160;<br/>
looked like, an‘ Atticus, when they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of&#160;<br/>
those things… Atticus, he was real nice…”<br/>
His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me.<br/>
“Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.”<br/>
He turned out the light and went into Jem’s room. He would be there all night,&#160;<br/>
and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.<br/>
